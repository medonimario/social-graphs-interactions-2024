== Life and career ==

Later, he lived in Paris, London - where he met [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], Berlin and Munchen, returning to Russia in 1918. 

From 1920 to 1928, he was assistant manager of the Central Archives Board, and from 1928 to 1931, deputy director of the Lenin Institute, and in 1932 a member of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]]. In the 1920s, he edited volumes of philosophical writings by [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], and [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and wrote a number of works on the Marxist theory of the state and law, and on the philosophy and history of [[Marxism]].<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/apr/06vva.htm Lenin: 242. TO V. V. ADORATSKY<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

In December 1929, during the celebration of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s official 50th birthday (in fact, he was 51), leading soviet academics were expected to produce articles praising the leader's contribution to their disciplines. The veteran head of the Marx-Engels Institute, [[David Riazanov|David Riazonov]], and the foremost Soviet philosopher, [[Abram Deborin]] failed to comply, but Adoratsky stepped in with an article published in ''[[Izvestia]]'', praising Stalin as a great [[Theoretician (Marxism)|Marxist theoretician]].

Early in 1931, after a case had been fabricated against Riazonov, Adoratsky took his place, becoming head of the merged [[Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute|Marx–Engels and Lenin Institutes]]. He also headed the Department of Philosophy of the [[Communist Academy]] from 1931 to 1936 and the [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Philosophy]] of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union|USSR Academy of Sciences]] Institute of Philosophy from 1936 to 1939.<ref name=":0" />

Forced to retire through ill health in 1939, he was replaced as head of the Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute by [[Mark Borisovich Mitin|M.B. Mitin]]. In July 1941, when the Institute was evacuated as the German army approached Moscow, Adoratsky pleaded that he was too ill to travel in a freight car, for which he was expelled from the institute and denied his salary. His daughter appealed to Mitin to intervene, but he refused. Adoratsky was then evacuated with other members of the Academy of Sciences to [[Alma Ata]], where he fell seriously ill. After being discharged form hospital, he was allocated unheated rooms, where he had to live and work in the kitchen. He returned to Moscow in 1943, and died there on 5 June 1945.<ref>{{cite web |title=Владимир Викторович Адоратский |url=http://alya-aleksej.narod.ru/index/0-65 |website=Москва Новое Донское кладбище |access-date=25 July 2019}}</ref>
