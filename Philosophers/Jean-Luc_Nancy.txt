'''Jean-Luc Nancy''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɑː|n|ˈ|s|iː}} {{respell|nahn|SEE}}; {{IPA|fr|ʒɑ̃lyk nɑ̃si|lang}}; 26 July 1940 – 23 August 2021) was a French [[Philosophy|philosopher]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jean-Luc Nancy (1940–2021)|date=25 August 2021 |url=https://www.artforum.com/news/jean-luc-nancy-1940-2021-86406|access-date=2021-08-26|publisher=[[Artforum]]|language=en-US}}</ref> Nancy's first book, published in 1973, was ''Le titre de la lettre'' (''The Title of the Letter'', 1992), a reading of the work of French [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]], written in collaboration with [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]]. Nancy is the author of works on many thinkers, including ''La remarque spéculative'' in 1973 (''The Speculative Remark'', 2001) on [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], ''Le Discours de la syncope'' (1976) and ''L'Impératif catégorique'' (1983) on [[Immanuel Kant]], ''Ego sum'' (1979) on [[René Descartes]], and ''Le Partage des voix'' (1982) on [[Martin Heidegger]].

In addition to ''Le titre de la lettre'', Nancy collaborated with Lacoue-Labarthe on several other books and articles. Nancy is credited with helping to reopen the question of the ground of [[community]] and [[politics]] with his 1985 work ''La communauté désoeuvrée'' (''The Inoperative Community''), following [[Maurice Blanchot|Blanchot]]'s ''The Unavowable Community'' (1983) and [[Giorgio Agamben|Agamben]] responded to both with  ''The Coming Community'' (1990). One of the very few monographs that [[Jacques Derrida]] ever wrote on a contemporary philosopher is ''On Touching, Jean-Luc Nancy''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=1773|title=On Touching, Jean-Luc Nancy|first1=Jacques|last1=Derrida|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804742436|year=2005}}</ref>

== Biography ==
Jean-Luc Nancy graduated in philosophy in 1962 from the [[University of Paris]]. He taught for a short while in [[Colmar]] before becoming an assistant at the [[Strasbourg]] Institut de Philosophie in 1968. In 1973, he received his [[doctorate]] with a dissertation on Kant under the supervision of [[Paul Ricoeur|Paul Ricœur]]. Nancy was then promoted to ''Maître de conférences'' (associate professor) at the [[Marc Bloch University|Université des Sciences Humaines de Strasbourg]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, Nancy was a guest professor at universities all over the world, from the [[University of California]] to the [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universität]] in [[Berlin]]. He has been invited as a cultural delegate of the French Ministry of External Affairs to speak in [[Eastern Europe]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]]. In 1987, Nancy became a ''[[Docteur d'État]]'' at the  [[Université Toulouse II|Université de Toulouse-Le-Mirail]] for a thesis on freedom in Heidegger under the supervision of [[Gérard Granel]]. The jury was composed of [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. It was published as ''L'expérience de la liberté'' (1988).

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Nancy suffered serious medical problems. He underwent a [[heart transplant]] and his recovery was made more difficult by a long-term cancer diagnosis. He stopped teaching and participating in almost all of the committees with which he was engaged, but continued to write. Many of his best known texts were published during this time. An account of his experience, ''L'intrus'' (''The Intruder''), was published in 2000. Nancy was a professor at the [[University of Strasbourg]]. Nancy was also [[Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] Chair and Professor of Philosophy at The [[European Graduate School]].<ref>https://egs.edu/biography/jean-luc-nancy/ Jean-Luc Nancy Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Chair and Professor of Philosophy at The European Graduate School / EGS.</ref>

Filmmaker [[Claire Denis]] has made at least two movies inspired by Jean-Luc Nancy and his works. Many other artists have worked with Nancy as well, such as [[Simon Hantaï]], [[Soun-gui Kim]] and [[Phillip Warnell]]. Nancy has written about the filmmaker [[Abbas Kiarostami]] and featured prominently in the film ''[[The Ister (film)|The Ister]]''.

Nancy died on 23 August 2021 at the age of 81.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dna.fr/culture-loisirs/2021/08/24/jean-luc-nancy-est-decede|title=Le philosophe Jean-Luc Nancy est décédé|work=Les Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace|language=fr|date=24 August 2021|access-date=24 August 2021}}</ref>

== Major works ==

===''Les Fins de l'homme''===
In 1980, Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe organized a conference at [[Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle]] on Derrida and politics entitled "Les Fins de l'homme" ("The Ends of Man"). The conference solidified Derrida's place at the forefront of contemporary philosophy, and was a place to begin an in-depth conversation between philosophy and contemporary politics. Further to their desire to rethink the political, Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe set up in the same year the ''Centre de Recherches Philosophiques sur la Politique'' (Centre for Philosophical Research on the Political). The centre was dedicated to pursuing philosophical rather than empirical approaches to political questions, and supported such speakers as [[Claude Lefort]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]]. By 1984, however, Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe were dissatisfied with the direction work at the centre was taking, and it was closed down.<ref>For more details on the reasons for the closure, see Lacoue-Labarthe & Nancy, "''Chers Amis'': A Letter on the Closure of the Political," in Lacoue-Labarthe & Nancy, ''Retreating the Political'' (London & New York: Routledge, 1997), pp. 143–47.</ref>

During that period Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy produced several important papers, together and separately. Some of these texts appear in ''Les Fins de l'homme à partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 août 1980'' (1981), ''Rejouer le politique'' (1981), ''La retrait du politique'' (1983), and ''Le mythe nazi'' (1991, revised edition; originally published as ''Les méchanismes du fascisme'', 1981). Many of these texts are gathered in translation in ''Retreating the Political'' (1997).

===''La Communauté désœuvrée''===
Nancy's first book on the question of [[community]], ''La Communauté désœuvrée'' (''The Inoperative Community'', 1986), is perhaps his best-known work.<ref>The work is a response to the Maurice Blanchot's ''The Inoperative Community'' (1983)—see [https://lectures.revues.org/16166 ''Jean-Luc Nancy, La communauté désavouée'' at Lectures - Revues.org].</ref> This text is an introduction to some of the main philosophical themes Nancy continued to work with. Nancy traces the influence of the notion of community to concepts of [[experience]], [[discourse]], and the [[individual]], and argues that it has dominated modern thought. Discarding popular notions, Nancy redefines community, asking what can it be if it is reduced neither to a collection of separate individuals, nor to a [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasized]] communal substance, e.g., [[fascism]]. He writes that our attempt to design [[society]] according to pre-planned definitions frequently leads to social violence and [[political terror]], posing the social and political question of how to proceed with the development of society with this knowledge in mind. ''La Communauté désœuvrée'' means that community is not the result of a production, be it social, economic or even political ([[Nationalism|nationalist]]) production; it is not ''une [[:fr:oeuvre|œuvre]]'', a "work of art" ("œuvre d'art", but "art" is here understood in the sense of "artifice").

{{blockquote|"The community that becomes ''a single thing'' (body, mind, fatherland, Leader...) ...necessarily loses the ''in'' of being-''in''-common. Or, it loses the ''with'' or the ''together'' that defines it. It yields its being-together to a being ''of'' togetherness. The truth of community, on the contrary, resides in the retreat of such a being." (Preface, xxxix).}}

===''L'Expérience de la liberté''===
Nancy's dissertation for his ''[[Doctorat d'État]]'' looked at the works of Kant, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] and Heidegger, and concentrated on their treatment of the topic of [[Free will|freedom]]. It was published in 1988 as ''L'Expérience de la Liberté'' (''The Experience of Freedom''). Since then, Nancy has continued to concentrate on developing a reorientation of Heidegger's work. Nancy treats freedom as a [[property]] of the individual or collectivity, and looks for a "non-subjective" freedom which would attempt to think the [[Existentialism|existential]] or [[wiktionary:finite|finite]] origin for every freedom. Nancy argues that it is necessary to think freedom in its finite being, because to think of it as the property of an infinite subject is to make any finite being a limit of freedom. The existence of the other is the necessary condition of freedom, rather than its limitation.

===''Le sens du monde''===
Nancy addresses the [[World (philosophy)|world]] in its contemporary global configuration in other writings on freedom, justice and sovereignty. In his 1993 book ''Le sens du monde'' (''The Sense of the World''), he asks what we mean by saying that we live in one world, and how our sense of the world is changed by saying that it is situated within the world, rather than above or apart from it. To Nancy, the world, or [[existence]], is our [[Ontology|ontological]] responsibility, which precedes political, judicial and moral responsibility. He describes our being in the world as an exposure to a naked existence, without the possibility of support by a fundamental metaphysical order or cause. Contemporary existence no longer has recourse to a divine framework, as was the case in feudal society where the meaning and course of life was predetermined. The [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] of our naked existence as an ontological question is the main challenge of our existence in contemporary global society.

All of these themes relating to world are taken up again by Nancy in his 2002 book ''La création du monde ou la mondialisation'' (''The Creation of the World or Globalization''), where he makes the distinction between globalization as a deterministic process and mondialisation as an open-ended "world-forming" process. Here, he connects his critique with [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s [[critique of political economy]], which saw "free labour" as what produces the world. Nancy argues that an authentic "dwelling" in the world must be concerned with the creation of meaning (enjoyment) and not final purposes, closed essences, and exclusive worldviews. The present system of expanding cities and nodes in the planetary techno-scientific network (tied to capitalism) leads to the loss of world, because the world is treated as an object (globe), even though the self-deconstruction of [[ontotheology]] increasingly made it the "subject" of its own creation.

=== ''Être singulier pluriel'' ===
In his book ''Être singulier pluriel'' (''Being Singular Plural'', 2000), Nancy tackles the question of how we can speak of a plurality of a "we" without making the "we" a singular identity. The premise of the title essay in this book is that there is no being without "being-with," that "I" does not come before "we" (i.e., ''Dasein'' does not precede ''Mitsein'') and that there is no existence without co-existence. In an extension from his thoughts on freedom, community, and the sense of the world, he imagines the "being-with" as a mutual exposure to one another that preserves the freedom of the "I", and thus a community that is not subject to an exterior or pre-existent definition.

{{blockquote|"There is no meaning if meaning is not shared, and not because there would be an ultimate or first signification that all beings have in common, but because meaning is itself the sharing of Being."}}

The five essays that follow the title piece continue to develop Nancy's philosophy through discussions of sovereignty, [[war]] and [[technology]], [[ecotechnics]], [[Identity (social science)|identity]], the [[Gulf War]] and [[Sarajevo]]. Nancy's central concern in these essays remains the "being-with", which he uses to discuss issues of [[psychoanalysis]], politics and [[multiculturalism]], looking at notions of "[[Self (philosophy)|self]]" and "other" in current contexts.

== Artistic analysis ==
Nancy has also written for art catalogues and international art journals, especially on contemporary art. He also writes poetry and for the theatre and has earned respect as an influential philosopher of art and culture. In his book ''Les Muses'' published in 1994 (''The Muses'', 1996), he begins with an analysis of Hegel's thesis on the death of art. Among the essays in ''The Muses'' is a piece on [[Caravaggio]], originally a lecture given at the [[Louvre]]. In this essay, Nancy looks for a different conception of [[painting]] where painting is not a [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of the [[empirical]] world, but a presentation of the world, of sense, or of existence. Nancy has published books on [[film]] and [[music]], as well as texts on the problem of representation, on the statute of [[literature]], on [[image]] and [[violence]], and on the work of [[On Kawara]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], and [[Friedrich Hölderlin]].

==Film theory==
Nancy's text ''[[L'intrus]]'' formed the basis for French director [[Claire Denis|Claire Denis's]] film of the same name.

He has written extensively on film, including ''The Evidence of Film,'' a short work on [[Abbas Kiarostami]].

Nancy appears in the film ''[[The Ister (film)|The Ister]]'', based on [[Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger's]] 1942 lectures on [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Friedrich Hölderlin's]] poem "Der Ister" (published as ''[[Hölderlin's Hymn "The Ister"]]''). The film focuses on the relation of politics, technology and myth.

Nancy has developed three films in conjunction with artist-filmmaker Phillip Warnell. He appears in their 2009 film Outlandish: 'Strange Foreign Bodies', which also features a text he wrote specifically for the project, Étranges Corps Étrangers. Nancy contributed a poem, 'Oh The Animals of Language' to Warnell's 2014 feature-length film 'Ming of Harlem: Twenty One Storeys in the Air'. Warnell and Nancy worked on a new text-film collaboration which was completed in 2017, 'The Flying Proletarian'.
