'''Marsilio T. Ficino''' ({{IPA|it|marˈsiːljo fiˈtʃiːno|lang}}; [[Latin]] name: {{lang|la|Marsilius Ficinus}}; 19 October 1433 – 1 October 1499) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[scholar]] and [[Catholic priest]] who was one of the most influential [[Christian humanism|humanist]] [[philosophers]] of the early [[Italian Renaissance]]. He was an [[astrologer]], a reviver of [[Neoplatonism]] in touch with the major academics of his day, and the first translator of [[Plato]]'s complete extant works into [[Latin]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marsilio Ficino|date=2006|publisher=North Atlantic Books|others=Voss, Angela.|isbn=1556435606|location=Berkeley, Calif.|pages=ix–x|oclc=65407018}}</ref> His [[Platonic Academy (discussion group)|Florentine Academy]], an attempt to revive [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]], influenced the direction and tenor of the Italian Renaissance and the development of [[European philosophy]].

==Early life==
Ficino was born at [[Figline Valdarno]]. His father, Diotifeci d'Agnolo, was a [[physician]] under the patronage of [[Cosimo de' Medici]], who took the young man into his household and became the lifelong patron of Marsilio, who was made tutor to his grandson, [[Lorenzo de Medici|Lorenzo de' Medici]]. [[Pico della Mirandola|Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]], the Italian humanist philosopher and scholar, was another of his students.<ref>{{Citation |last=Field |first=Arthur |title=The Platonic Academy of Florence |date=2002-01-01 |work=Marsilio Ficino |pages=359–376 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/9789047400547_020 |access-date=2024-05-23 |publisher=BRILL |doi=10.1163/9789047400547_020 |isbn=978-90-474-0054-7}}</ref>

== Career and thought ==

=== Platonic Academy ===
During the sessions at Florence of the [[Council of Ferrara-Florence]] in 1438–1445, during the failed attempts to heal the [[Western Schism|schism of the Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Catholic) churches]], [[Cosimo de' Medici]] and his intellectual circle had made acquaintance with the Neoplatonic philosopher [[Gemistus Pletho|George Gemistos Plethon]], whose discourses upon Plato and the Alexandrian mystics so fascinated the humanists of Florence that they named him the second Plato. In 1459 [[John Argyropoulos]] was lecturing on Greek language and literature at Florence, and Ficino became his pupil.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |inline=y|wstitle=Ficino, Marsilio |volume=10 |pages=317–319 |first=John Addington |last=Symonds |author-link=John Addington Symonds}}</ref>

[[File:Corpus Hermeticum.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'': first Latin edition, by Marsilio Ficino, 1471, at the [[Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica]], [[Amsterdam]].]]
When Cosimo decided to [[Platonic Academy (Florence)|refound]] [[Plato's Academy]] at Florence, he chose Ficino as its head. In 1462, Cosimo supplied Ficino with [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts of Plato's work, whereupon Ficino started translating the entire corpus into [[Latin]]<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8duCpxbqUp4C&pg=PA98 |title=The Civilization of the Italian Renaissance: A Sourcebook |editor-link=Kenneth R.

Ficino also produced a translation of a collection of Hellenistic Greek documents found by [[Leonardo da Pistoia (monk)|Leonardo da Pistoia]] later called [[Hermetica]],<ref>[[Frances A.

Though trained as a physician, Ficino became a priest in 1473.<ref>[[Christiane Joost-Gaugier|Christiane L.

In 1489 he was accused of [[Christian heresy|heresy]] before [[Pope Innocent VIII]]<ref name=EB1911/> and was acquitted.

Writing in 1492 Ficino proclaimed: {{blockquote|"This century, like a [[golden age]], has restored to light the [[liberal arts]], which were almost extinct: [[grammar]], poetry, [[rhetoric]], painting, sculpture, architecture, music&nbsp;... this century appears to have perfected [[astrology]]." |source=A letter to a friend (1492)|title=Marcilio Ficino}}

Ficino's letters, extending over the years 1474–1494, survive and have been published.<ref name=EB1911/> He wrote ''De amore'' (Of Love) in 1484. ''[[De vita libri tres]]'' (Three books on life), or ''De triplici vita''<ref name="Walker2000">{{cite book|author=Daniel Pickering Walker|title=Spiritual and Demonic Magic: From Ficino to Campanella|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-XjCKQi1lgC|date=January 2000|publisher=[[Penn State Press]]|isbn=0-271-02045-8|page=3}}</ref> (The Book of Life), published in 1489, provides a great deal of medical and astrological advice for maintaining health and vigor, as well as espousing the [[Neoplatonist]] view of the [[Anima mundi|world's ensoulment]] and its integration with the human soul:
{{blockquote|There will be some men or other, superstitious and blind, who see life plain in even the lowest animals and the meanest plants, but do not see life in the heavens or the world&nbsp;... Now if those little men grant life to the smallest particles of the world, what folly! what envy! neither to know that the Whole, in which 'we live and move and have our being,' is itself alive, nor to wish this to be so.<ref>Marsilio Ficino, ''Three Books on Life'', translated by Carol V. Kaske and John R. Clark, Tempe AZ: The Renaissance Society of America, 2002.  From the ''Apologia'', p. 399.  (The internal quote is from Acts 17:28.)</ref>}}

One metaphor for this integrated "aliveness" is Ficino's astrology. In the ''Book of Life'', he details the interlinks between behavior and consequence. It talks about a list of things that hold sway over a man's destiny.

=== Medical works ===
Probably due to early influences from his father, Diotifeci, who was a doctor to Cosimo de' Medici, Ficino published Latin and Italian treatises on medical subjects such as ''Consiglio contro la pestilenza'' (Recommendations for the treatment of the plague) and ''De vita libri tres'' (Three books on life). His medical works exerted considerable influence on Renaissance physicians such as [[Paracelsus]], with whom he shared the perception on the unity of the [[Microcosm–macrocosm analogy|microcosmos and macrocosmos]], and their interactions, through somatic and psychological manifestations, with the aim to investigate their [[Doctrine of signatures|signatures]] to cure diseases. Those works, which were very popular at the time, dealt with astrological and alchemical concepts. Thus Ficino came under the suspicion of heresy; especially after the publication of the third book in 1489, which contained specific instructions on healthful living in a world of demons and other spirits.<ref>Marsilio Ficino.

Retrieved 26 April 2014.</ref>

=== Platonic love ===
Notably, Ficino coined the term [[Platonic love]], which first appeared in his letter to Alamanno Donati in 1476. In 1492, Ficino published ''Epistulae'' (Epistles), which contained Platonic love letters, written in Latin, to his academic colleague and life-long friend, [[Giovanni Cavalcanti (poet)|Giovanni Cavalcanti]], concerning the nature of Platonic love. Because of this, some have alleged Ficino was a homosexual, but this finds little basis in his letters.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kaske |first=Carol |date=2006 |title=Review: Marsilio Ficino.

== Death ==
Ficino died on 1 October 1499 at [[Villa Medici at Careggi|Careggi]]. In 1521 his memory was honored with a bust sculpted by [[Andrea Ferrucci]], which is located in the south side of the nave in the [[Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore]].{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}
