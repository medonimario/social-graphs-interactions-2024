==Philosophical work==
Field's first work was a commentary on [[Alfred Tarski]]'s theory of [[truth]], which he has worked on since 1972.  His current view on this matter is in favor of a [[deflationary theory of truth]]. His most influential work produced in this period is probably "Theory Change and the Indeterminacy of Reference" (''[[Journal of Philosophy]]'', '''70'''(14): 462–481), in which he introduced the concept of partial [[denotation]].

In the 1980s, Field started a project in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] in support of [[mathematical fictionalism]], the doctrine that all mathematical statements are merely useful fictions, and should not be taken to be literally true. More precisely, Field aimed to produce reconstructions of science that would remove all reference to mathematical entities, hence showing that mathematics is dispensable to science in opposition to the [[Quine–Putnam indispensability argument]].<ref>[[Stephen Yablo|Yablo, Stephen]].

Much of his current work is in semantic [[paradox]]es. In 2008, he gave the John Locke Lectures, entitled "Logic, Normativity, and Rational Revisability".<ref>[http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/lectures/john_locke_lectures John Locke Lectures]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021081503/http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/lectures/john_locke_lectures |date=2008-10-21 }} - Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford</ref>
