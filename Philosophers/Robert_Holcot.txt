{{Short description|English Dominican scholastic philosopher, theologian and influential Biblical scholar}}
'''Robert Holcot''',<ref>Also Holgot, Holkot, Holcott, Robertus or Ropertus, Robertus Haldecotus.</ref> [[Order of Preachers|OP]] (c. 1290 – 1349) was an English [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[scholastic philosopher]], theologian and influential Biblical scholar.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Holcot]], [[Northamptonshire]]. A follower of [[William of Ockham]], he was nicknamed the ''Doctor firmus et indefatigabilis'', the "strong and tireless doctor." He made important contributions to semantics, the debate over God’s knowledge of future contingent events; discussions of predestination, grace and merit; and philosophical theology more generally.<ref>Thomas Williams, ‘Transmission and Translation’, in AS McGrade, ed, ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Philosophy'', (Cambridge: CUP, 2003), p. 337.</ref>

Modern interest in Holcot has been limited. His influence in the [[late Middle Ages]], however, was clearly great, as is evidenced by the number of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century manuscripts of his work that have survived. For example, there exist 48 manuscripts of Holcot’s ''Questions on the [[Sentences]]'' (compared to 36 manuscripts of [[William of Ockham]]’s ''[[Sentences]]'' commentary).<ref>Thomas Williams, ‘Transmission and Translation’, in AS McGrade, ed, ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Philosophy'', (Cambridge: CUP, 2003), p. 337.</ref> More impressive are the 175 manuscripts of his commentary on the ''[[Book of Wisdom]]'' (''Lectiones super librum Sapientiae''),<ref>Thomas Williams, ‘Transmission and Translation’, in AS McGrade, ed, ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Philosophy'', (Cambridge: CUP, 2003), p. 337.</ref> a work that has been identified as a prime literary source for [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Nun's Priest's Tale]]''.<ref>See [http://www.chss.montclair.edu/english/furr/npt.html The Nun's Priest's Tale and Nominalism: A Preliminary Study] by Grover C. Furr and references given there.</ref>  Holcot was still read in the sixteenth-century when the Parisian theologian, [[Jacques Almain]], wrote a work engaging Holcot's opinions.  The commentary on the ''[[Book of Wisdom]]'' was printed in 1480, and, subsequently, went through many editions. 

An edition of the questions on the Sentences was printed at Lyon in 1497, although it contained a cover letter stating that the manuscripts used to produce this edition were disorderly and unreliable. Unfortunately, this remains the only edition of Holcot’s Sentences available today.<ref>Thomas Williams, ‘Transmission and Translation’, in AS McGrade, ed, ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Philosophy'', (Cambridge: CUP, 2003), p. 337.</ref>

Holcot died of the [[Black Death|Black plague]] in 1349.<ref>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/holkot/  ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Robert Holkot"]</ref>
