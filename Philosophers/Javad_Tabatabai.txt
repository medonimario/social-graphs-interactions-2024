Tabatabai presented a controversial theory regarding the causes of the decline of political thought and society in Iran over the last few centuries. His ideas on Iranian decline have affected the intellectual debates on modernity and democracy currently underway in Iran. 

Tabatabai's career-long research revolved around this question: “What conditions made modernity possible in Europe and led to its abnegation in Iran?” He answered this question by adopting a “Hegelian approach” that privileged a philosophical reading of history on the assumption that philosophical thought is the foundation and essence of any political community and the basis for any critical analysis of it as well.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Boroujerdi, M., & Shomali |date= 2015 |title=The Unfolding of Unreason: Javad Tabatabai's Idea of Political Decline in Iran |journal=Iranian Studies |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=949–965 |doi=10.1080/00210862.2014.926661 |s2cid=145769588}}</ref> In 2001, in an interview with [[Libération]], he said that political and ideological Islam are already dead, because they have no plans for modernity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.liberation.fr/planete/2001/10/27/javad-tabatabai-l-islam-politique-est-voue-a-l-echec_382158 |title=Javad Tabatabai : L'islam politique est voué à l'échec |date=27 October 2001 |website=Libération.fr |language=fr |access-date=13 September 2019}}</ref>

Tabatabai rejected [[Anti-Iranian sentiment|anti-Iranian]] [[irredentism]] and warned about the perils facing Iran from the provocations of [[pan-Turkism]].<ref name="Ahmadi"/> Tabatabai defended [[Persian language|Persian]] as Iran's national language and argued that the histories of [[History of Turkey|Turkey]] and the Republic of [[History of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] contained many forgeries and fabrications.<ref name="Ahmadi"/> During one of his lectures in Tabriz, he emphasized that the history of the "Baku Republic" (i.e. the Republic of Azerbaijan) is central to the [[history of Iran]].<ref name="Ahmadi"/>
