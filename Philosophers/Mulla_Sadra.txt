According to [[Oliver Leaman]], Mulla Sadra is arguably the single most important and influential philosopher in the Muslim world in the last four hundred years.<ref>Leaman 2013, p.146.</ref><ref>[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H027.htm Mulla Sadra (Sadr al-Din Muhammad al-Shirazi) (1571/2-1640)] by John Cooper</ref>

Though not its founder, he is considered the master of the [[Illuminationism|Illuminationist]] (or, Ishraghi or [[Illuminationist philosophy|Ishraqi]]) school of Philosophy, a seminal figure who synthesized the many tracts of the [[Islamic Golden Age]] philosophies into what he called the [[Transcendent Theosophy]] or ''al-hikmah al-muta’āliyah''.

Mulla Sadra brought "a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of [[reality]]" and created "a major transition from [[essentialism]] to [[existentialism]]" in Islamic philosophy,<ref>{{citation|title=Mulla Sadra's Transcendent Philosophy|first=Muhammad|last=Kamal|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-7546-5271-8|pages=9, 39}}</ref> although his existentialism should not be too readily compared to Western existentialism. His was a question of existentialist [[cosmology]] as it pertained to God, and thus differs considerably from the individual, [[Morality|moral]], and/or social, questions at the heart of Russian, French, German, or American Existentialism.

Mulla Sadra's philosophy ambitiously synthesized [[Avicennism]], [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]]'s [[Illuminationist philosophy]], [[Ibn Arabi]]'s [[Sufi metaphysics]], and the [[Kalam|theology]] of the [[Sunni]] [[Ash'ari]] school of Kalam into the framework of [[Twelvers|Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'ism]].

His main work is ''[[The Transcendent Philosophy of the Four Journeys of the Intellect]]'', or simply ''Four Journeys'', In which he attempted to reach [[Sufism]] and prove the idea of Unity of Existence by offering a new intake and perspective on [[Peripatetic philosophy]] that was offered by [[Alpharabius]] and [[Avicenna]] in the Islamic world.

==Biography==

A copy of a painted portrait of him is hanged on the wall.]][[File:The House of Mulla Sadra in Kahak Qom.jpg|thumb|The house of Mulla Sadra in Kahak (a small village near the city of Qom, in Iran) where Mulla Sadra used to live in when he was exiled due to some of his ideas.]]

===Early life===
Mulla Sadra was born in [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]], to a notable family of court officials in 1571 or 1572,<ref name="RizviSajjad">Rizvi, Sajjad (2002), ''Reconsidering the life of Mulla Sadra Shirazi'', Pembroke College, p. 181</ref> 
In Mulla Sadra's time, the [[Safavid dynasty]] governed over [[Iran]]. [[Safavid]] kings granted independence to [[Fars Province]], which was ruled by the king's brother, Mulla Sadra's father, Khwajah Ibrahim Qavami, who was a knowledgeable and extremely faithful politician. As the ruler of the vast region of Fars Province, Khwajah was rich and held a high position. When Mulla Sadra was born, the family named him Muhammad but called him Sadra. Years later, Sadra was nicknamed "Mulla", that is, "great scientist". Sadra was Khwajah's only child. In that time it was customary that the children of aristocrats were educated by private teachers in their own palace. Sadra was a very intelligent, strict, energetic, studious, and curious boy and mastered all the lessons related to [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Arabic literature]], as well as the [[Calligraphy|art of calligraphy]], during a very short time. Following old traditions of his time, and before the age of puberty, he also learned [[Equestrianism|horse riding]], hunting and fighting techniques, [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], some [[medicine]], [[Jurisprudence in Islam|jurisprudence]], and [[Islamic Law|Islamic law]]. However, he was mainly attracted to philosophy and particularly to mystical philosophy and [[gnosis]].<ref>{{harv|Ayatollahi|2005|p=12}}</ref>

In 1591, Mulla Sadra moved to [[Qazvin]] and then, in 1597, to [[Isfahan]] to pursue a traditional and institutional education in philosophy, theology, [[Hadith]], and [[hermeneutics]]. At that time, each city was a successive capital of the [[Safavid dynasty]] and the center of [[Twelver]] [[Shi'ite]] seminaries. Sadra's teachers included [[Mir Damad]] and [[Baha' ad-Din al-`Amili]].<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/molla-sadra-sirazi MOLLĀ ṢADRĀ ŠIRĀZI] iranicaonline.org</ref>

===Teachers===
Mulla Sadra became a master of the science of his time. In his own view, the most important of these was philosophy. In [[Qazvin]], Sadra acquired most of his scholarly knowledge from two prominent teachers, namely [[Baha' ad-Din al-`Amili]] and [[Mir Damad]], whom he accompanied when the Safavid capital was transferred from Qazvin to [[Isfahan]] in 1596 CE / 1006 AH.<ref>{{harv|Ayatollahi|2005|p=18}}</ref> Shaykh Baha was an expert in [[Islamic sciences]] but also a master of astronomy, [[Pure mathematics|theoretical mathematics]], engineering, architecture, medicine, and some fields of secret knowledge. Mir Damad also knew the science of his time but limited his domain to jurisprudence, [[hadith]]. and mainly philosophy. Mir Damad was a master of both the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] ([[Aristotle|Aristotelian]]) and [[Illuminationism|Illuminationist]] schools of Islamic philosophy. Mulla Sadra obtained most of his knowledge of philosophy and gnosis from Damad and always introduced Damad as his true teacher and spiritual guide.<ref>{{harv|Ayatollahi|2005|p=13}}</ref>

After he had finished his studies, Sadra began to explore unorthodox doctrines and as a result was both condemned and excommunicated by some [[Shi'i]] ʿulamāʾ. He then retired for a lengthy period of time to a village named Kahak, near [[Qom]], where he engaged in contemplative exercises. While in Kahak, he wrote a number of minor works, including the Risāla fi 'l-ḥashr and the Risāla fī ḥudūth al-ʿālam .<ref name="brillonline">MacEoin, D. "Mullā Ṣadrā S̲hīrāzī Ṣadr al-Dīn Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm Ḳawāmī S̲h̲īrāzī". Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online. Augustana. 13 April 2010 <[http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-5490> Reference Works, Brill] brillonline.nl</ref>

=== Return to Shiraz ===
In 1612, Ali Quli Khan, son of [[Allahverdi Khan|Allāhwirdī Ḵhān]]<ref name="brillonline" /> and the powerful governor of Fārs, asked Mulla Sadra to abandon his exile and to come back to [[Shiraz]] to teach and run a newly bulit [[madrasa]] ([[Khan School]], [[Persian language|Persian]]: مدرسه خان). Mulla Sadra devoted his rest of life to teach the intellectual sciences, particularly his own teachings [[Transcendent Theosophy]].<ref name="RizviSajjad" />

During his time in [[Shiraz|Shīrāz]], Ṣadrā began writing treatises that synthesized wide-ranging strands of existing Islamic systems of thought at [[Khan School]]. The ideas of his school, which may be seen as a continuation of the School of Iṣfahān of Mīr Dāmād and Shaykh Bahāʾī, were promulgated after Sadrā's death by his pupils, several of whom would become sought-after thinkers in their own right, such as, [[Mohsen Fayz Kashani|Mullā Muḥsin Fayḍ Kāshānī]] (Mulla Sadra's son-in-law), and [[Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji|ʿAbd Razzāḳ Lāhidjī]].

Although Ṣadrā's influence remained limited in the generations after his death, it increased markedly during the 19th century, when his ideas helped inspire a renewed Akhbārī tendency within Twelver Shīʿism. In recent times, his works have been studied in Iran, Europe, and America.<ref name="brillonline" /> He died in [[Basra]] after the [[Hajj]] and was buried in the present-day city of [[Najaf]], Iraq.

==Philosophical ideas==
{{main|Transcendent theosophy}}

===Existentialism===
Although Existentialism as defined nowadays is not identical to Mulla Sadra's definition, he was the first to introduce the concept. According to Mulla Sadra, "existence precedes the essence and is thus principal since something has to exist first and then have an essence." It is notable that for Mulla Sadra this was an issue that applied specifically to God and God's position in the universe, especially in the context of reconciling God's position in the Qur'an with the Greek-influenced cosmological philosophies of Islam's Golden Era.<ref>{{Harv|Razavi|1997|p=130}}</ref>

Mulla Sadra's metaphysics gives priority to existence over essence (i.e., [[quiddity]]). That is to say, essences are variable and are determined according to existential "intensity" (to use Henry Corbin's definition). Thus, essences are not immutable.<ref>Corbin (1993), pp. 342, 343</ref> The advantage to this schema is that it is acceptable to the fundamental statements of the Qur'an,{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} even as it does not necessarily undermine any previous Islamic philosopher's Aristotelian or Platonic foundations.

Indeed, Mulla Sadra provides immutability only to God, while intrinsically linking essence and existence to each other, and to God's power over existence. In so doing, he provided for God's authority over all things while also solving the problem of God's knowledge of particulars, including those that are evil, without being inherently responsible for them&nbsp;— even as God's authority over the existence of things that provide the framework for evil to exist. This clever solution provides for freedom of will, God's supremacy, the infiniteness of God's knowledge, the existence of evil, and definitions of existence and essence that leave the two inextricably linked insofar as humans are concerned, but fundamentally separate insofar as God is concerned.<ref name="SayyedHussein">Sayyed Hussein Nasr, ''Persian Sufi Literature'', Lecture, George Washington University, 2006</ref>

Perhaps most importantly, the primacy of existence provides the capacity for God's judgement without God being directly, or indirectly, affected by the evil being judged. God does not need to possess sin to know sin: God is able to judge the intensity of sin as God perceives existence.<ref name="SayyedHussein" />

One result of Sadra's existentialism is "The unity of the intellect and the intelligible" (Arabic: ''Ittihad al-Aaqil wa l-Maqul''. As [[Henry Corbin]] describes:{{blockquote|All the levels of the modes of being and perception are governed by the same law of unity, which at the level of the intelligible world is the unity of intellection, of the intelligizing subject, and of the Form intelligized&nbsp;— the same unity as that of love, lover and beloved. Within this perspective we can perceive what Sadra meant by the unitive union of the human [[The dichotomy of soul and spirit in Islamic philosophy|soul]], in the supreme awareness of its acts of knowledge, with the active Intelligence which is the Holy Spirit. It is never a question of an arithmetical unity, but of an intelligible unity permitting the reciprocity which allows us to understand that, in the soul which it metamorphoses, the Form—or Idea—intelligized by the active Intelligence is a Form which intelligizes itself, and that as a result the active Intelligence or Holy Spirit intelligizes itself in the soul's act of intellection. Reciprocally, the soul, as a Form intelligizing itself, intelligizes itself as a Form intelligized by the active Intelligence.<ref>Corbin (1993), pp. 343, 344</ref>}}

===Substantial motion===
Another central concept of Mulla Sadra's philosophy is the theory of "[[Substance theory|substantial]] [[Motion (physics)|motion]]" (Arabic:''al-harakat al-jawhariyyah''), which is "based on the premise that everything in the order of [[nature]], including [[celestial spheres]], undergoes substantial change and transformation as a result of the self-[[Flow (psychology)|flow]] (''sarayan al-wujud'') and penetration of [[being]] (''fayd'') which gives every concrete individual entity its share of being. In contrast to [[Aristotle]] and [[Avicenna]] who had accepted change only in four [[Categorization|categories]], i.e., [[quantity]] (''kamm''), [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] (''kayf''), [[wikt:position|position]] (''wad’'') and [[wikt:place|place]] (''‘ayn''), Sadra defines change as an all-pervasive [[reality]] running through the entire cosmos including the category of [[Substance theory|substance]] (''jawhar'')."<ref>{{citation|first=Ibrahim|last=Kalin|contribution=Sadr al-Din Shirazi (Mulla Sadra) (b. 1571-1640)|url=http://www.cis-ca.org/voices/s/sadra.htm|title=Resources on Islam & Science|editor1-first=Muzaffar|editor1-last=Iqbal|editor1-link=Muzaffar Iqbal|editor2-first=Ibrahim|editor2-last=Kalin|date=March 2001|access-date=4 February 2008}}</ref>

===Existence as reality===

Mulla Sadra held the view that Reality is Existence. He believed that an essence was by itself a general notion, and therefore does not, in reality, exist.<ref>Fazlur Rahman, ''The Philosophy of Mulla Sadra'' State University of New York Press, 1975, pp. 27, 28</ref>

To paraphrase Fazlur Rahman on Mulla Sadra's Existential Cosmology: Existence is the one and only reality. Existence and reality are therefore identical. Existence is the all-comprehensive reality and there is nothing outside of it. Essences which are negative require some sort of reality and therefore exist. Existence therefore cannot be denied. Therefore, existence cannot be negated. As Existence cannot be negated, it is self-evident that Existence is God. God should not be searched for in the realm of existence but is the basis of all existence.<ref>Fazlur Rahman, ''The Philosophy of Mulla Sadra'' State University of New York Press, 1975, p. 125</ref> Reality in Arabic is "Al-Haq", and is stated in the Qur'an as one of the [[Names of God]].

To paraphrase Mulla Sadra's ''Logical Proof for God'':<ref>Rizvi, Sajjad ''Mulla Sadra and Metaphysics'', 2009, p. 126</ref>
#There is a being
#This being is a perfection beyond all perfection
#God is Perfect and Perfection in existence
#Existence is a singular and simple reality
#That singular reality is graded in intensity in a scale of perfection
#That scale must have a limit point, a point of greatest intensity and of greatest existence
#Therefore, God exists

===Causation===
Sadra argued that all contingent beings require a cause which puts their balance between existence and non-existence in favor of the former; nothing can come into existence without a cause. Since the world is therefore contingent upon this First Act, not only must God exist, but God must also be responsible for this First Act of creation.

Sadra also believed that a causal regress was impossible because the causal chain could work only in the matter that had a beginning, middle, and end:

# a pure cause at the beginning
# a pure effect at the end
# a nexus of cause and effect
[[File:مدرسه خان شیراز.jpg|thumb|400x400px|[[Khan School]] (est. 1595 AD) was a major [[madrasa]] that Mulla Sadra was teaching his philosophy during his residence in [[Shiraz]] until he died.]]
The [[Causality|Causal nexus]] of Mulla Sadra was a form of existential ontology within a cosmological framework that Islam supported. For Mulla Sadra the causal "End" is as pure as its corresponding "Beginning", which instructively places God at both the beginning and the end of the creative act. God's capacity to measure the intensity of Existential Reality by measuring causal dynamics and their relationship to their origin, as opposed to knowing their effects, provided the Islamically-acceptable framework for God's judgement of reality without being tainted by its particulars. This was a solution to a question that had haunted Islamic philosophy for almost one thousand years: How is God able to judge sin without knowing sin?<ref name="SayyedHussein" />

===Truth===
For Mulla Sadra a true statement is a statement that is true to the concrete facts in existence. He held a metaphysical and not a formal idea of truth, claiming that the world consists of mind-independent objects that are always true and truth is not what is rationally acceptable within a certain theory of description. In Mulla Sadra's view one cannot have access to the reality of being: only linguistic analysis is available. This theory of Truth has two levels: the claim that a proposition is true if it corresponds to things in reality; and that a proposition can be true if it conforms with the actual thing itself.<ref>Rizvi, Sajjad ''Mulla Sadra and Metaphysics'', 2009, pp. 59–62</ref>
