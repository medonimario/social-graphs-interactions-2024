'''Paul Jakob Deussen''' ({{IPA|de|ˈpaʊl ˈjaːkɔp ˈdɔʏsn̩|lang}}; 7 January 1845 – 6 July 1919) was a German [[indology|Indologist]] and professor of philosophy at [[University of Kiel]].<ref>Hans Rollmann (1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709076 Deussen, Nietzsche, and Vedānta], Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 39, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1978), pages 125-132</ref> Strongly influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], Deussen was a friend of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Swami Vivekananda]]. In 1911, he founded the [[Schopenhauer Society]] (''Schopenhauer-Gesellschaft''). Professor Deussen was the first editor, in 1912, of the scholarly journal Schopenhauer Yearbook (''Schopenhauer-Jahrbuch'').

Deussen, who [[Sanskrit]]ised his name to "Deva-Sena"<ref>Gopal Stavig (2011), Western Admirers of Ramakrishna and His Disciples, Vedanta, {{ISBN|978-8175053342}}, page 434</ref> as a mark of his admiration for the language, is one of the distinguished roll of Europeans who — often with lyrical admiration — participated in the scholarly Western discovery of Sanskrit and Hinduism that took place in British India itself, Germany, France and England.

==Biography==
Paul Deussen was born on 7 January 1845 in [[Oberdreis]], [[Neuwied (district)|Neuwied]] in the [[Rhine Province]],<ref name="BrownCollinson2012">{{cite book|editor1=Stuart Brown|editor2=Diane Collinson|editor3=Robert Wilkinson|title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZQqBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA184|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-92796-8|pages=184}}</ref> one of eight children of a clergyman of modest means. He became a student, and lifelong devotee, of the German philosopher Schopenhauer, and of the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]; and he became a friend of Friedrich Nietzsche. Deussen was educated at [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] Universities between 1864 and 1881, writing his dissertation on Plato's philosophy. Deussen was appointed ''Privatdocent'' (1881-7) and ''Extraordinarius'' (1887-9) at the university of Berlin, and ''Ordinarius'' (1889–1919, the year of his death), at the [[University of Kiel]]. Until 1919, Deussen continued to edit the Schopenhauer Yearbook, as well as working on an edition of  Schopenhauer's works.

It was when he attended a lecture at the University of Bonn by Professor [[Christian Lassen]] (1800-1876), expounding the ''Shakuntala'', that Deussen was fired by Sanskrit and Hinduism. Deussen's first publication (1877) was published in English as ''The Elements of Metaphysics'' in 1894. It was followed by the translations of ''The Sutra of the Vedanta'' in 1906; ''The Philosophy of the Upanishads'' also in 1906; and ''The System of the Vedanta'' in 1912. His visit to India in 1904 was published in English as ''My Indian Reminiscences'' in 1912.  However, his autobiographical papers, edited by his daughter Erika (1894-1956) and published in German in 1922, have so far not been translated into English.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Deussen's ''System of the Vedanta'' has been reprinted several times: he uses the ''Brahmasutra'' and – rather less — Adi Shankara's commentary on it, as the structure for his exposition.

His scholarship has been described as immense, perceptive, and meticulous. Mahinder Gulati refers to him as an [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] and [[Sanskrit]] scholar.<ref>"Comparative Religious And Philosophies : Anthropomorphlsm And Divinity", by Mahinder N. Gulati, p. 106</ref>

Paul Deussen's name is thus linked with George Boucher, [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] and [[Sir John Woodroffe]] in British India, [[Anquetil-Duperron]] and [[Eugène Burnouf]] in France, [[Heinrich Roth]], [[Franz Bopp]], [[Friedrich von Schlegel]]  and [[Max Müller]] in Germany, in the European revelation of the wealth of Hinduism as revealed by Sanskrit documents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}
