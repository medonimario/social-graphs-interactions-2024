'''Bernardus Maria Ignatius "Bernard" Delfgaauw''' (24 November 1912 – 20 August 1993) was a Dutch [[philosopher]]. He studied [[Dutch language]] and ([[thomism|thomistic]]) [[philosophy]] at the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam|University of Amsterdam]]. In 1947 he earned his [[doctoral degree]] on the French metaphysician [[Louis Lavelle]]. In 1961 he became a [[professor]] in philosophy at the [[University of Groningen]].

Delfgaauw was a prolific writer; subjects included existentialism, young [[Young Marx|Marx]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], mysticism, evolution, and he developed a philosophy of grammar and of social relations. He also wrote a bestselling concise history of philosophy that was in continuous reprint and got translated into several languages.

During the [[Vietnam War]] it was legally prohibited, punishable by law in the Netherlands to say that [[Lyndon B. Johnson|president Johnson]] was a killer. In 1967 Bernard Delfgaauw said at a symposium: "Measured by criteria used in Nuremberg and Tokyo, Johnson, his staff members, and generals are war criminals."<ref>{{cite web

After that, the Dutch student protesters wantonly changed their slogan from "Johnson Killer" to "Johnson Miller".
