'''George Santayana''' (b. '''Jorge Agustín Nicolás Ruiz de Santayana y Borrás''', December 16, 1863 – September 26, 1952) was a Spanish-American [[philosopher]], [[essayist]], [[poet]], and [[novelist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/santayana|title=the definition of Santayana|publisher=dictionary.com|access-date=2016-05-07|archive-date=2018-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123022451/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/santayana|url-status=live}}</ref> Born in [[Spain]], Santayana was raised and educated in the United States from the age of eight and identified as an American, yet always retained a valid [[Spanish passport]].<ref>Santayana, George, "Apologia Pro Mente Sua", in P.

As a philosopher, Santayana is known for [[aphorism]]s, such as "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it",<ref>Santayana, George (1905) ''Reason in Common Sense'', p. 284, volume&nbsp;1 of ''[[The Life of Reason]]''.</ref> and "Only the dead have seen the end of war",<ref>Santayana, George (1922) ''Soliloquies in England and Later Soliloquies'', number 25.</ref> and his definition of beauty as "[[Aesthetics|Pleasure objectified]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/artbook.html/c8023.htm|title=Beauty as Intrinsic Pleasure by George Santayana|access-date=2016-06-15|archive-date=2018-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426054326/http://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/artbook.html/c8023.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although an [[atheist]], Santayana valued the culture of the Spanish Catholic values, practices, and worldview, in which he was raised.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lovely |first1=Edward W. |title=George Santayana's Philosophy of Religion: His Roman Catholic Influences and Phenomenology |date=Sep 28, 2012 |publisher=Lexington Books |pages=1, 204–206}}</ref> As an [[intellectual]], George Santayana was a broad-range [[cultural critic]] in several academic disciplines.

==Early life==
George Santayana was born on December 16, 1863, in [[Calle de San Bernardo]] of [[Madrid]] and spent his early childhood in [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]], Spain. His mother Josefina Borrás was the daughter of a Spanish official in the [[Philippines]] and he was the only child of her second marriage.<ref name="SEP">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/santayana/ "George Santayana" at the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216142215/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/santayana/ |date=February 16, 2018}}. Retrieved April 25, 2021</ref> Josefina Borrás' first husband was George Sturgis, a Boston merchant with the Manila firm Russell & Sturgis. She had five children with him; two of them died in infancy. She lived in Boston for a few years following her husband's death in 1857; in 1861, she moved with her three surviving children to Madrid. There she encountered Agustín Ruiz de Santayana, an old friend from her years in the Philippines. They married in 1862. A [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[civil servant]], Ruiz de Santayana was a painter and minor [[intellectual]]. The family lived in Madrid and Ávila, and Jorge was born in Spain in 1863.

In 1869, Josefina Borrás de Santayana returned to Boston with her three Sturgis children, because she had promised her first husband to raise the children in the US. She left the six-year-old Jorge with his father in Spain. Jorge and his father followed her to Boston in 1872. His father, finding neither Boston nor his wife's attitude to his liking, soon returned alone to Ávila, and remained there the rest of his life. Jorge did not see him again until he entered [[Harvard College]] and began to take his summer vacations in Spain. Sometime during this period, [[Jorge]]'s first name was anglicized as [[George (given name)|George]], the English equivalent.

==Later life==
{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2022}}
[[File:Santayana 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Santayana early in his career]]Santayana never married. His romantic life, if any, is not well understood. Some evidence, including a comment Santayana made late in life comparing himself to [[A. E. Housman]], and his friendships with people who were openly [[homosexual]] and [[bisexual]], has led scholars to speculate that Santayana was perhaps homosexual or bisexual, but it remains unclear whether he had any actual heterosexual or homosexual relationships.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/santayana/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Herman|last1=Saatkamp|first2=Martin|last2=Coleman|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=8 April 2017|archive-date=18 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190318091822/https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/santayana/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1912, Santayana resigned his position at Harvard to spend the rest of his life in Europe. He had saved money and been aided by a legacy from his mother. After some years in [[Ávila]], [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]], after 1920, he began to winter in [[Rome]], eventually living there year-round until his death. During his 40 years in Europe, he wrote 19 books and declined several prestigious academic positions. Many of his visitors and correspondents were Americans, including his assistant and eventual literary executor, [[Daniel Cory]]. In later life, Santayana was financially comfortable, in part because his 1935 novel, ''[[The Last Puritan]]'', had become an unexpected best-seller. In turn, he financially assisted a number of writers, including [[Bertrand Russell]], with whom he was in fundamental disagreement, philosophically and politically.

Santayana's one novel, ''The Last [[Puritan]]'', is a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'', centering on the personal growth of its [[protagonist]], Oliver Alden. His ''Persons and Places'' is an [[autobiography]]. These works also contain many of his sharper opinions and [[List of French expressions in English#Bon mot|''bons mots'']]. He wrote books and essays on a wide range of subjects, including philosophy of a less technical sort, [[literary criticism]], the [[history of ideas]], politics, [[human nature]], morals, the influence of religion on culture and [[social psychology]], all with considerable wit and humour.

While his writings on technical philosophy can be difficult, his other writings are more accessible and pithy. He wrote poems and a few plays, and left ample correspondence, much of it published only since 2000. Like [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], Santayana observed American culture and character from a foreigner's point of view. Like [[William James]], his friend and mentor, he wrote philosophy in a literary way. [[Ezra Pound]] includes Santayana among [[List of cultural references in The Cantos|his many cultural references in]] ''[[The Cantos]]'', notably in "[[Canto]] LXXXI" and "Canto XCV". Santayana is usually considered an American writer, although he declined to become an American citizen, resided in [[Fascist Italy]] for decades, and said that he was most comfortable, intellectually and [[aesthetic]]ally, at [[Oxford University]]. Although an [[atheist]], Santayana considered himself an "[[aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]]" and spent the last decade of his life in Rome under the care of [[Catholic nun]]s. In 1941, he entered a hospital and [[convent]] run by the [[Little Company of Mary]] (also known as the [[Blue Nun]]s) on the [[Celian Hill]] at 6 Via Santo Stefano Rotondo in Roma, where he was cared for by the sisters until his death in September 1952.<ref>[https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1952/9/29/george-santayana-88-dies-in-rome/ "George Santayana, 88, Dies in Rome"].

See also [[Harold Kirker]] (Fall 1990), "Santayana in Rome", ''Bulletin of the Santayana Society'', pp. 35–37 for Kirker's wartime visit with Santayana in Rome.</ref> Upon his death, he did not want to be buried in [[consecrated]] land, which made his burial problematic in Italy. Finally, the Spanish consulate in Rome agreed that he be buried in the Pantheon of the Obra Pía Española, in the [[Campo Verano|Campo Verano cemetery]] in Rome.

==Philosophical work and publications==
Santayana's main philosophical work consists of ''[[The Sense of Beauty]]'' (1896), his first book-length [[monograph]] and perhaps the first major work on [[aesthetics]] written in the United States; ''[[The Life of Reason]]'' (5 vols., 1905–06), the high point of his Harvard career; ''[[Scepticism and Animal Faith]]'' (1923); and ''[[The Realms of Being]]'' (4 vols., 1927–1940). Although Santayana was not a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] in the mold of [[William James]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Josiah Royce]], or [[John Dewey]], ''The Life of Reason'' arguably is the first extended treatment of [[pragmatism]] written.

Like many of the classical pragmatists, Santayana was committed to [[metaphysical naturalism]]. He believed that human [[cognition]], cultural practices, and [[social]] [[institutions]] have evolved so as to harmonize with the conditions present in their environment. Their value may then be adjudged by the extent to which they facilitate human happiness. The alternate title to ''The Life of Reason'', "the Phases of Human Progress", is indicative of this [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] stance.

Santayana was an early adherent of [[epiphenomenalism]], but also admired the classical [[materialism]] of [[Democritus]] and [[Lucretius]]. (Of the three authors on whom he wrote in ''Three Philosophical Poets'', Santayana speaks most favorably of Lucretius). He held [[Spinoza]]'s writings in high regard, calling him his "master and model".<ref>George Santayana (1948–1952), ''The Letters of George Santayana'', Book Eight, p. 8:39</ref>

Although an [[atheist]],<ref>"My atheism, like that of Spinoza, is true piety towards the universe, and denies only gods fashioned by men in their own image, to be servants of their human interests." George Santayana, "On My Friendly Critics", in ''[[Soliloquies]] in England and Later Soliloquies'', 1922 (from Rawson's ''Dictionary of American Quotations'' via credoreference.com). Accessed August 1, 2008.</ref><ref>"Santayana playfully called himself 'a Catholic atheist', but in spite of the fact that he deliberately immersed himself in the stream of Catholic religious life, he never took the sacraments. He neither literally regarded himself as a Catholic nor did Catholics regard him as a Catholic." Kai Nielsen (July 1974), "[[Empiricism]], Theoretical Constructs, and God", ''The Journal of Religion'', Vol. 54, No. 3, pp. 199–217 (p. 205), published by The University of Chicago Press.</ref> he held a fairly benign view of religion and described himself as an "aesthetic Catholic". Santayana's views on religion are outlined in his books ''Reason in Religion'', ''The Idea of Christ in the Gospels'', and ''Interpretations of Poetry and Religion''.

He held [[racial superiority]] and [[eugenic]] views. He believed [[superior race]]s should be discouraged from "intermarriage with inferior stock".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c_QDCwAAQBAJ&q=%22some+races+are+obviously%22&pg=PT96 | title=The Life of Reason: Human Understanding| last1=Santayana| first1=George| date=2015-11-26}}</ref>

Santayana is remembered in large part for his [[aphorism]]s, many of which have been so frequently used as to have become [[cliché]]d. His philosophy has not fared quite as well. He is regarded by most as an excellent [[prose]] stylist, and [[John Lachs]] (who is sympathetic with much of Santayana's philosophy) writes, in ''On Santayana'', that his eloquence may ironically be the very cause of this neglect.

Santayana influenced those around him, including [[Bertrand Russell]], whom Santayana single-handedly steered away from the [[ethics]] of [[G. E. Moore]].<ref>Michael K. Potter. ''Bertrand Russell's Ethics''. London and New York: Continuum, 2006. Pp. xiii, 185. {{ISBN|0826488102}}, p.4</ref> He also influenced many prominent people such as Harvard students [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Conrad Aiken]], [[Van Wyck Brooks]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Max Eastman]], and [[Wallace Stevens]]. Stevens was especially influenced by Santayana's aesthetics and became a friend even though Stevens did not take courses taught by Santayana.<ref>Lensing, George S. (1986).

Santayana is quoted by the Canadian-American [[sociologist]] [[Erving Goffman]] as a central influence in the thesis of his famous book ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]'' (1959). Religious historian [[Jerome A. Stone]] credits Santayana with contributing to the early thinking in the development of [[religious naturalism]].<ref>''Religious Naturalism Today'', pp. 21–37</ref> English mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] quotes Santayana extensively in his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''[[Process and Reality]]'' (1929).<ref>Whitehead, A.N.

[[Chuck Jones]] used Santayana's description of [[fanaticism]] as "redoubling your effort after you've forgotten your aim" to describe his cartoons starring [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]].<ref>See the sixth paragraph, [http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110004344 That's Not All, Folks! "Of course you know this means war."

==In popular culture==
Santayana's passing is referenced in the lyrics to singer-songwriter [[Billy Joel]]'s 1989 music single, "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]".<ref>[https://www.billyjoel.com/song/we-didnt-start-fire-11/ We Didn't Start the Fire] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210506081048/https://www.billyjoel.com/song/we-didnt-start-fire-11/ |date=May 6, 2021}}.

The quote "Only the dead have seen the end of war" is frequently attributed or [[False attribution|misattributed]] to [[Plato]]; an early example of this misattribution (if it is indeed misattributed) is found in General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s Farewell Speech given to the Corps of Cadets at [[West Point]] in 1962.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://plato-dialogues.org/faq/faq008.htm|title=Plato FAQ: Did Plato write :"Only the dead have seen the end of war"?|last=SUZANNE|first=Bernard F.|website=plato-dialogues.org|access-date=2018-04-29|archive-date=2018-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018121745/http://plato-dialogues.org/faq/faq008.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Who-Really-Said-That-/141559|title=Who Really Said That?|date=2013-09-16|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2018-04-29|archive-date=2018-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625050445/https://www.chronicle.com/article/Who-Really-Said-That-/141559|url-status=live}}</ref><!--
