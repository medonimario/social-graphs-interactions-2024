'''Liu Shaoqi''' ({{small|pronounced}} {{IPAc-cmn|l|you|2|-|sh|ao|4|q|i|2}}; 24 November 1898{{spaced ndash}}12 November 1969) was a Chinese revolutionary and politician. He was the [[chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] from 1954 to 1959, first-ranking [[Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party|vice chairman of the Chinese Communist Party]] from 1956 to 1966, and the [[President of the People's Republic of China|chairman of the People's Republic of China]], the [[head of state]] from 1959 to 1968. He was considered to be a possible successor to [[Mao Zedong]], but was purged during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. 

In his early years, Liu participated in labor movements in strikes, including the [[May Thirtieth Movement]]. After the [[Chinese Civil War]] began in 1927, he was assigned by the CCP to work in Shanghai and [[Northeast China]], and travelled to the [[Jiangxi Soviet]] in 1932. He participated in the [[Long March]], and was appointed as the Party Secretary in North China in 1936 to lead anti-Japanese resistance efforts in the area. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Liu led the CCP's Central Plains Bureau. After the [[New Fourth Army incident]] in 1941, Liu became a political commissar of the [[New Fourth Army]]. After Liu returned to [[Yan'an]] in 1943, he became a secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party|CCP Secretariat]] and a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. 

After the [[proclamation of the People's Republic of China]] in 1949, Liu became a vice chairman of the [[Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China (1949–1954)|Central People's Government]]. After the establishment of the National People's Congress in 1954, Liu was elected as the chairman of its Standing Committee. In 1959, he succeeded Mao Zedong as the chairman of the People's Republic of China. During his chairmanship, he implemented policies of [[economic reconstruction]] in China, especially after the [[Seven Thousand Cadres Conference]] in 1962. Liu was publicly named as Mao's chosen successor in 1961. However, he was criticized and then purged by Mao soon after the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, eventually being placed under house arrest in 1967. He was forced out of public life and was labelled the "commander of China's bourgeoisie headquarters", China's foremost "[[capitalist roader|capitalist-roader]]", and a traitor to the revolution. He died in prison in 1969 due to complications from [[diabetes]]. Liu was widely condemned in the years following his death until he was [[political rehabilitation|posthumously rehabilitated]] by [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s government in 1980, as part of the ''[[Boluan Fanzheng]]'' period. Deng's government granted Liu a national memorial service.

In 1920, he and [[Ren Bishi]] joined a Socialist Youth Corps; the next year, Liu was recruited to study at the Comintern's [[University of the Toilers of the East]] in [[Moscow]].<ref name=Dittmer/>

He joined the newly formed [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) in 1921. The next year he returned to [[China]] and, as secretary of the All-China Labor Syndicate, led several railway workers' strikes in the Yangzi Valley and at [[Anyuan District|Anyuan]] on the Jiangxi-Hunan border.<ref name=Dittmer/>

== Early political activities ==
In 1925, Liu became a member of the [[Guangzhou]]-based All-China Federation of Labor Executive Committee. During the next two years he led numerous political campaigns and strikes in [[Hubei]] and Shanghai. He worked with [[Li Lisan]] in Shanghai in 1925, organizing Communist activity following the [[May Thirtieth Movement]]. After his work in Shanghai, Liu traveled to [[Wuhan]]. He was briefly arrested in [[Changsha]] and then returned to Guangzhou to help organize the 16-month-long [[Canton–Hong Kong strike]].<ref>Dittmer, p. 14</ref>

He was elected to the [[Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|Party's Central Committee]] in 1927 and was appointed to the head of its Labor Department.<ref>Chen, Jerome. ''Mao and the Chinese Revolution,'' (London), 1965, p. 148</ref> Liu returned to work at the Party headquarters in Shanghai in 1929 and was named Secretary of the [[Manchuria]]n Party Committee in [[Shenyang|Fengtian]].<ref>Dittmer, p. 15</ref> In 1930 and 1931 he attended the Third and Fourth Plenums of the Sixth Central Committee, and was elected to the Central Executive Committee (i.e., Politburo) of the Chinese Soviet Republic in 1931 or 1932.

Liu became the Party Secretary of [[Fujian]] Province in 1932. He accompanied the [[Long March]] in 1934 at least as far as the crucial [[Zunyi Conference]], but was then sent to the so-called "White Areas" (areas controlled by the [[Kuomintang]]) to reorganize underground activities in northern China, centered around [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]. He became Party Secretary in North China in 1936, leading the anti-Japanese movements in that area with the assistance of [[Peng Zhen]], [[An Ziwen]], [[Bo Yibo]], [[Ke Qingshi]], [[Liu Lantao]], and [[Yao Yilin]]. In February 1937 he established, with the rest of the North China Bureau, in Beijing.<ref name="How The Red Sun Rose"/>{{rp|104}} In the same year, he challenged [[Zhang Wentian]] on the Party's historical problems, criticizing the leftist errors after 1927, thus breaching the consensus reached at the Zunyi Conference that the Party line had been essentially correct.<ref name="How The Red Sun Rose">Gao Hua, ''How the Red Sun Rose: The Origins and Development of the Yan'an Rectification Movement, 1930–1945'', Chinese University of Hong Kong Press. 2018</ref>{{rp|103}} Liu ran the Central Plains Bureau in 1939; and, in 1941, the Central China Bureau.

In 1937, Liu traveled to the Communist base at [[Yan'an]]; in 1941, he became a political commissar of the [[New Fourth Army]].<ref name="dittmer17">Dittmer 1974, p. 17 citing Tetsuya Kataoka, ''Resistance and Revolution in China: The Communists and the Second United Front'', 1974 pre-publication.</ref> He was elected as one of five CCP Secretaries at the Seventh Party Congress in 1945. In a report following the 7th Congress, Liu articulated four "mass points" to be instilled in every party member: "everything for the masses; full responsibility to the masses; faith in the self-emancipation of the masses; and learning from the masses".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=MacFarquhar |first=Roderick |date=1973 |title=Problems of Liberalization and the Succession at the Eighth Party Congress |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/652160 |journal=The China Quarterly |issue=56 |pages=617–646 |doi=10.1017/S0305741000019524 |jstor=652160 |issn=0305-7410}}</ref> 

After that Congress, he became the supreme leader of all Communist forces in Manchuria and northern China,<ref name="dittmer17" /> a role frequently overlooked by historians.

== People's Republic of China ==
Liu became the Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government in 1949. In 1954 China adopted a new constitution at the first [[National People's Congress]] (NPC); at the Congress's first session, he was elected [[Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|chairman of the Congress's Standing Committee]], a position he held until the second NPC in 1959. From 1956 until his downfall in 1966, he ranked as the First [[Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party]].<ref name=dittmer17/>

Liu's work focused on party organizational and theoretical affairs.<ref>Dittmer 1974, p. 206</ref> He drafted party regulations and oversaw the organizational development of the party consistent with [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] principles.<ref name=":Tsang&Cheung">{{Cite book |last1=Tsang |first1=Steve |author-link=Steve Chang |title=The Political Thought of Xi Jinping |last2=Cheung |first2=Olivia |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2024 |isbn=9780197689363}}</ref>{{Rp|pages=18-19}} He was an orthodox Soviet-style Communist and favored state planning and the development of heavy industry. He elaborated upon his political and economic beliefs in his writings. His best known works include ''How to be a Good Communist'' (1939), ''On the Party'' (1945), and ''Internationalism and Nationalism'' (1952).

=== State Chairman ===
Liu spoke very strongly in favor of the Great Leap Forward at the Eighth CCP National Congress in May 1958. However, he later expressed concerns about the adverse effects of the campaign, particularly the widespread famine it caused. During the Lushan Conference in 1959, Liu emphasized the need for corrective measures and supported more moderate economic policies.<ref name="dittmer39-40">Dikötter, Frank. ''Mao's Great Famine: The History of China's Most Devastating Catastrophe, 1958-62''. Walker & Company, 2010.</ref> At this Congress Liu stood together with [[Deng Xiaoping]] and Peng Zhen in support of Mao's policies against those who were more critical, such as [[Chen Yun]] and Zhou Enlai.

As a result, Liu gained influence within the party. In April 1959, he succeeded Mao as [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chairman of the People's Republic of China]] (Chinese President). However, Liu began to voice concern about the outcomes of the Great Leap in August 1959 [[Lushan Conference]].<ref name="dittmer39-40" /> To correct the mistakes of the Great Leap Forward, Liu and Deng Xiaoping led economic reforms that bolstered their prestige among the party apparatus and the national populace. The economic policies of Deng and Liu were notable for being more moderate than Mao's radical ideas. For example, in the period when the economic turmoil of the Great Leap Forward prompted the Party to delay the Third [[Five-year plans of China|Five Year Plan]], Liu led a group of high officials who worked to revive the economy through an increased role for markets, greater material incentives for workers, a lower rate of investment, a more moderate pace for developmental goals, and increased funding for consumer industries.<ref name=":0222">{{Cite book |last=Meyskens |first=Covell F. |url= |title=Mao's Third Front: The Militarization of Cold War China |date=2020 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-108-78478-8 |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |oclc=1145096137}}</ref>{{Rp|page=40}} During preliminary work on the Third Five Year Plan, Liu stated:<ref name=":0222" />{{Rp|page=51}}{{Block quote|text=In the past, the infrastructure battlefront was too long.

=== Conflict with Mao ===
[[File:Liu Shaoqi and Indira Gandhi.jpg|thumb|Liu Shaoqi and [[Indira Gandhi]], 1954]]
Liu was publicly acknowledged as Mao's chosen successor in 1961; however, by 1962 his opposition to Mao's policies had led Mao to mistrust him. Liu's advocacy for pragmatic economic reforms and his criticism of the Great Leap Forward's failures highlighted the ideological rift between him and Mao.<ref name = "Culture1"/> After Mao succeeded in restoring his prestige during the 1960s,<ref>[[Jonathan D. Spence|Spence, Jonathan D.]] ''[[The Search for Modern China]]'', New York: [[W.W. Norton and Company]]. 1999. {{ISBN|0-393-97351-4}} p. 566.</ref> Liu's eventual downfall became "inevitable". Liu's position as the second-most powerful leader of the CCP contributed to Mao's rivalry with him at least as much as Liu's political beliefs or factional allegiances in the 1960s,<ref name="Culture1">Teiwes, Frederick C., and Warren Sun. ''The Tragedy of Lin Biao: Riding the Tiger during the Cultural Revolution, 1966-1971''. University of Hawaii Press, 1996.</ref> especially during and after the [[Seven Thousand Cadres Conference]], indicating that Liu's later persecution was the result of a power struggle that went beyond the goals and well-being of either China or the Party.

Liu was among the senior officials who in 1964 were initially reluctant to support Mao's proposed [[Third Front (China)|Third Front]] campaign to develop basic industry and national defense industry in China's interior to address the risk of invasion by the United States or the Soviet Union.<ref name=":0222" />{{Rp|page=41}} In an effort to stall, Liu proposed additional surveys and planning.<ref name=":0222" />{{Rp|page=40}} Academic Covell F. Meyskens writes that Liu and the high-ranking colleagues who agreed with him did not want to engage in another rapid industrialization campaign so soon after the failure of the Great Leap Forward and that instead they sought to continue the gradual approach of developing areas and increasing consumption.<ref name=":0222" />{{Rp|page=41}} When fears of American invasion increased after the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident|Gulf of Tonkin Incident]], Liu and his colleagues changed their views and began fully supporting the Third Front construction.<ref name=":0222" />{{Rp|page=7}}

[[File:1966-06 1966年刘少奇率团访问巴基斯坦.jpg|thumb|Liu Shaoqi in June 1966, the first year of the Cultural Revolution]]
By 1966, few senior leaders in China questioned the need for a widespread reform to combat the growing problems of corruption and bureaucratization within the Party and the government. With the goal of reforming the government to be more efficient and true to the Communist ideal, Liu himself chaired the enlarged Politburo meeting that officially began the [[Cultural Revolution]]. However, Liu and his political allies quickly lost control of the Cultural Revolution soon after it was called, when Mao used the movement to progressively monopolize political power and to destroy his perceived enemies.<ref name = "Culture2">Qiu Jin, ''The Culture of Power: the Lin Biao Incident in the Cultural Revolution'', Stanford University Press: Stanford, California. 1999, p. 45</ref>

Whatever its other causes, the Cultural Revolution, declared in 1966, was overtly pro-Maoist, and gave Mao the power and influence to purge the Party of his political enemies at the highest levels of government. Along with closing China's schools and universities, and Mao's exhortations to young Chinese to randomly destroy old buildings, temples, and art, and to attack their teachers, school administrators, party leaders, and parents,<ref name="CR1">Spence, Jonathan D. ''The Search for Modern China'', New York: W.W. Norton and Company. 1999. {{ISBN|0-393-97351-4}} p. 575.</ref> the Cultural Revolution also increased Mao's prestige so much that entire villages adopted the practice of offering prayers to Mao before every meal.<ref>Spence, Jonathan D. ''The Search for Modern China'', New York: W.W. Norton and Company. 1999. {{ISBN|0-393-97351-4}} p. 584</ref>

In both national politics and Chinese popular culture, Mao established himself as a demigod accountable to no one, purging any that he suspected of opposing him<ref>Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2006. {{ISBN|962-996-280-2}} p. 4</ref> and directing the masses and [[Red Guards]] "to destroy virtually all state and party institutions".<ref name = "Culture2" /> After the Cultural Revolution was announced, most of the most senior members of the CCP who had voiced any hesitation in following Mao's direction, including Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, were removed from their posts almost immediately and, with their families, subjected to mass criticism and humiliation.<ref name="CR1" /> Liu and Deng, along with many others, were denounced as "[[capitalist roader]]s".<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Dittmer |first=Lowell |date=1981 |title=Death and Transfiguration: Liu Shaoqi's Rehabilitation and Contemporary Chinese Politics |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2054551 |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=455–479 |doi=10.2307/2054551 |jstor=2054551 |issn=0021-9118}}</ref> Liu was labeled as the "commander of China's bourgeoisie headquarters", China's foremost "[[capitalist roader|capitalist-roader]]", "the biggest capitalist roader in the Party", and a traitor to the revolution;<ref>{{Cite web |title=Liu Shaoqi (1898-1969) |url=https://repository.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/en/collection/crposter/liushaoqi |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180604125224/https://repository.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/en/collection/crposter/liushaoqi |archive-date=4 June 2018 |website=[[Chinese University of Hong Kong]]}}</ref> he was displaced as Vice Chairman of the CCP by [[Lin Biao]] in July 1966.

== Vilification, death and rehabilitation ==
[[File:Liu shaoqi.jpg|thumb|250px|Liu Shaoqi being subjected to public humiliation at a rally during the Cultural Revolution]]
At the [[9th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party|Ninth Party Congress]], Liu was denounced as a traitor and an enemy agent. Zhou Enlai read the Party verdict that Liu was "a criminal traitor, enemy agent and scab in the service of the imperialists, modern revisionists and the Kuomintang reactionaries". Liu's conditions did not improve after he was denounced in the Congress, and he died soon afterward.<ref name="Chung1">Chung, Jang.

In a memoir written by Liu's principal physician, he disputed the alleged medical maltreatment of Liu during his last days. According to Dr. Gu Qihua, there was a dedicated medical team in charge of treating Liu's illness; between July 1968 and October 1969, Liu had seven total occurrences of pneumonia due to his deteriorating immune system, and there had been a total of 40 group consultations by top medical professionals regarding the treatment of this disease. Liu was closely monitored on a daily basis by a medical team, and they made the best effort given the adverse circumstances. He died in prison from complications due to diabetes at 6:45&nbsp;a.m. on 12 November 1969 under a pseudonym in [[Kaifeng]], and was cremated the next day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.sina.com.cn/bk/wgs/2013-11-12/155073840_2.shtml |trans-title=Liu Shaoqi's Emergency Treatment |script-title=zh:回忆抢救刘少奇, 炎黄春秋 |date=12 November 2013 |publisher=[[Sina.com]] History |language=zh-cn}}</ref><ref name="Alexander V.

In February 1980, two years after Deng Xiaoping came to power, the Fifth Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the "Resolution on the Rehabilitation of Comrade Liu Shaoqi". The resolution fully rehabilitated Liu, declaring his ouster to be unjust and removing the labels of "renegade, traitor and scab" that had been attached to him at the time of his death.<ref name=":0" /> It also declared him to be "a great Marxist and proletarian revolutionary" and recognized him as one of the principal leaders of the Party. Lin Biao was blamed for "concocting false evidence" against Liu, and for working with the [[Gang of Four]] to subject him to "political frame-up and physical persecution". In 1980, Liu was posthumously rehabilitated by the CCP under Deng Xiaoping. This rehabilitation included a formal apology from the government, acknowledging that Liu had been wrongly persecuted and that his contributions to the Chinese Revolution and the early development of the People's Republic of China were significant and positive.<ref>Vogel, Ezra F.

On 23 November 2018, the CCP's [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] delivered a speech in the [[Great Hall of the People]] in Beijing to commemorate the 120th anniversary of the birth of Liu Shaoqi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.people.cn/n3/2018/1204/c90000-9524966.html|title=Xi's speech commemorating 120th anniversary of Liu Shaoqi's birth published |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=4 December 2018 |publisher=People's Daily |access-date=4 December 2018 }}</ref>

Liu Shaoqi's legacy remains controversial in China. While his role in the Chinese Revolution and early economic reforms is acknowledged, his persecution during the Cultural Revolution and the subsequent suffering highlight the complexities of his political career. Liu's pragmatic approach to economic policy is now seen as a precursor to the reforms that transformed China in the late 20th century.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lo Porto-Lefébure |first=Alessia |date=6 March 2009 |title=NAUGHTON (Barry) – The Chinese Economy.
