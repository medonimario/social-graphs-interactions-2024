== Biography ==

[[File:BenjaminTuckerYoung.jpg|thumb|upright|Tucker at a young age]]

Tucker made his editorial debut in [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchist]] circles in 1876, when [[Ezra Heywood]] published Tucker's English translation of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s classic work ''[[What is Property?]]'' In 1877, he published his first original journal ''Radical Review'', but it ran for only four issues. From August 1881 to April 1908, Tucker published ''[[Liberty (anarchist periodical)|Liberty]]'', a major individualist-anarchist periodical.<ref name="McElroy 1998">{{cite journal|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|author-link=Wendy McElroy|title=Benjamin Tucker, ''Liberty'', and Individualist Anarchism|journal=[[The Independent Review]]|date=Winter 1998|volume=II|issue=3|page=421|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_02_3_mcelroy.pdf|access-date=2013-06-25|archive-date=2019-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123223843/http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_02_3_mcelroy.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The periodical was instrumental in developing and formalizing the [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|individualist anarchist]] philosophy through publishing essays and serving as a format for debate. Beside Tucker, contributors also included [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Gertrude Kelly]], [[Auberon Herbert]], [[Dyer Lum]], [[Joshua K. Ingalls]], [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Victor Yarros]], [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], [[James L. Walker]], [[J. William Lloyd]], [[Florence Finch Kelly]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], [[Steven T. Byington]], [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson]], [[Jo Labadie]], [[Lillian Harman]] and [[Henry Appleton (anarchist)|Henry Appleton]]. Included in its masthead is a quote from Proudhon saying that liberty is "Not the Daughter But the Mother of Order".<ref name="McElroy 1998"/>

[[File:Benjamin R Tucker and family.jpg|thumb|upright|Benjamin Tucker with Oriole Tucker and Pearl Johnson]]

In 1939, Tucker died in the company of his family in [[Monaco]] and carried his beliefs to his deathbed.<ref name=oriole>{{cite book|author=Paul Avrich|title=Anarchist Voices|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|isbn=0-691-04494-5|chapter=Oriole Tucker Riché|page=11|title-link=Anarchist Voices}}</ref>

Towards the end of Tucker's life, anarchist [[Victor Yarros]] described him as a "forceful and clear writer, but a poor speaker" who considered writing for bourgeois newspapers to be "the worst form of prostitution".{{sfn|Yarros|1936|p=472}}

== Political views ==

Tucker's influences include [[Ricardo Mella]].<ref>Diez, Xavier. (2007). ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1938)''. Virus. p. 92. See [https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/iconoclasta-for-creative-individualist-anarchism-el-individualismo-eclectico ''El Individualismo ecléctico''] in The Anarchist Library]. "[W]ithin the strictly anarchist world we find some theorists like Ricardo Mella, who, due to his knowledge of the English language, knows deeply the work of [Benjamin] Tucker and that of the north American individualists, especially by reading regularly the British magazine ''Freedom'' and the north American ones ''The Alarm'' (Chicago) and the tuckerian ''Liberty'' (Boston). [...] Uncomfortable within the polemics between collectivists and libertarian communists, the Galician anarchist tries to integrate the different ideological currents under the proposal of Tarrida del Mármol of an anarchism without adjectives".</ref> 

=== Anarchism ===
{{anarchism sidebar}}
{{individualism sidebar}}
Tucker said that he became an [[anarchist]] at the age of eighteen.<ref>Symes, Lillian and Clement, Travers. Rebel America: The Story of Social Revolt in the United States. Harper & Brothers Publishers. 1934. p. 156.</ref> In the [[anarchist periodical]] ''[[Liberty (anarchist periodical)|Liberty]]'', he published the original work of [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], [[Joshua K. Ingalls]], [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Auberon Herbert]], [[Dyer Lum]], [[Victor Yarros]] and [[Lillian Harman]] (daughter of free love anarchist [[Moses Harman]]) as well as his own writing. After the French [[libertarian communist]] [[Joseph Déjacque]],<ref>Marshall, Peter (2009). ''[[Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism]]''. p. 641. "The word 'libertarian' has long been associated with anarchism, and has been used repeatedly throughout this work. The term originally denoted a person who upheld the doctrine of the freedom of the will; in this sense, Godwin was not a 'libertarian', but a 'necessitarian'. It came however to be applied to anyone who approved of liberty in general. In anarchist circles, it was first used by Joseph Déjacque as the title of his anarchist journal ''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social'' published in New York in 1858. At the end of the last century, the anarchist Sébastien Faure took up the word, to stress the difference between anarchists and authoritarian socialists".</ref>

According to Frank Brooks, an historian of [[American individualist anarchism]], it is easy to misunderstand Tucker's claim to [[socialism]]. Before Marxists established a hegemony over definitions of socialism, "the term socialism was a broad concept". Tucker as well as most of the writers and readers of ''Liberty'' understood socialism to refer to one or more of various theories aimed at solving the [[labor problem]] through radical changes in the capitalist economy. Descriptions of the problem, explanations of its causes and proposed solutions (abolition of [[Criticism of private property|private property]] and support of [[cooperative]]s or [[public ownership]]) varied among socialist philosophies.<ref>Brooks, Frank H. (1994). ''The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881–1908)''. Piscataway: Transaction Publishers. p. 75. {{ISBN|9781412837385}}.</ref>

Not all modern economists believe Marxists established a hegemony over definitions of socialism.<ref>Bestor, Arthur E. (June 1948). "The Evolution of the Socialist Vocabulary". ''Journal of the History of Ideas''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. '''9''' (3): 259–302. {{doi|10.2307/2707371}}. {{JSTOR|2707371}}.</ref>

Tucker said socialism was the claim that "labor should be put in possession of its own" while holding that what he respectively termed [[state socialism]] and [[anarchistic socialism]] had in common was the [[labor theory of value]].<ref>Brown, Susan Love. 1997. "The Free Market as Salvation from Government". In ''Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture''. Berg Publishers. p. 107.</ref>

Instead of asserting that [[common ownership]] was the key to eroding differences of economic power and appealing to [[social solidarity]], as did many [[social anarchists]], Tucker's individualist anarchism advocated distribution of property in an undistorted natural [[Free market#Socialism|free market]] as a mediator of egoistic impulses and a source of social stability rooted in a [[free-market socialist]] system.<ref>Freeden, Michael (1996). ''Ideologies and Political Theory: A Conceptual Approach''. Oxford University Press. p. 276.</ref>

Tucker first favored a [[natural rights]] philosophy in which an individual had a right to own the fruits of his labor, but then abandoned it in favor of [[egoist anarchism]] (influenced by Max Stirner) in which he believed that only the right of might exists until overridden by contract. According to Charles A. Madison, Tucker promoted full individual liberty and disdained communism in any form, believing that even a stateless communist society must encroach upon the liberty of individuals, insisting instead on the voluntary nature of all association and rejecting [[majority rule]], [[organized religion]] and the institution of [[marriage]] due to their compulsory nature.<ref name="Madison, Charles A.">Madison, Charles A. "Anarchism in the United States". ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol 6, No 1, January 1945, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707055?read-now=1&seq=11#page_scan_tab_contents p. 56].</ref>

Tucker connected his [[libertarian socialist]] economic views which included his opposition to non-labor income in the form of profit, interest and rent with those of [[Adam Smith]], [[Josiah Warren]], Proudhon and Marx while arguing against American anti-socialists who declared socialism as imported.<ref>Brooks, Frank H. (1994). ''The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881–1908)''. Piscataway: Transaction Publishers. p. 79. {{ISBN|9781412837385}}.</ref>

==== Anarchist society ====
Tucker disapproved of government ownership because to him state control was the most complete and most obnoxious form of monopoly, "a tyrant living by theft ... wasteful, careless, clumsy, and short-sighted". Tucker maintained that all forms of authoritarian activities imply the resort to force and nothing good or lasting was ever accomplished by compulsion. Thus, he refused to condone the overthrow of the state by violent means, arguing that abolishing government would likely result in physical conflicts over land and a reaction to restore the old regime. Hence, Tucker preached widespread education and ultimately a passive resistance that was to take forms such as refusal to pay taxes, the evasion of jury duty and military service and the non-observance of compulsion. Once society reached this state, individual liberty for all would prevail as a matter of course.<ref name="Madison, Charles A."/>

Tucker envisioned an individualist anarchist society with "each man reaping the fruits of his labour and no man able to live in idleness on an income from capital ... become[ing] a great hive of Anarchistic workers, prosperous and free individuals [combining] to carry on their production and distribution on the cost principle"<ref>''The Individualist Anarchists'', p. 276.</ref> rather than a bureaucratic organization of workers organized into rank and file unions. However, he did hold a genuine appreciation for labor unions (which he called trades-union socialism) and saw it as "an intelligent and self-governing socialism", and praised their "substitution of industrial socialism for usurping legislative mobism".<ref>''The Individualist Anarchists'', pp. 283–284.</ref>

According to [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], "the egalitarian implications of traditional individualist anarchists" such as Tucker and [[Lysander Spooner]] have been overlooked.<ref>Marshall, Peter (1992). ''Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism''. London: HarperCollins. pp. 564–565. {{ISBN|978-0-00-217855-6}}.</ref>

Tucker rejected the legislative programs of labor unions, laws imposing a short day, minimum wage laws, forcing businesses to provide insurance to employees and compulsory pension systems.<ref name="Yarros"/>

Tucker was opposed to compulsion and vehemently opposed reform movements with paternalistic goals such as state aid. He did not have a utopian vision of [[anarchy]] in which individuals would refrain from coercing others.<ref name="Yarros">{{cite journal|first=Victor|last=Yarros|title=Philosophical Anarchism: Its Rise, Decline, and Eclipse|year=1936|journal=[[The American Journal of Sociology]]|volume=41|issue=4|pages=470–483|doi=10.1086/217188|s2cid=145311911|author-link=Victor Yarros|jstor=2768957}}</ref>

=== Monopolies ===
{{libertarian socialism sidebar}}
Tucker argued that the poor condition of American workers resulted from four [[Legal monopoly|legal monopolies]] based in the authoritarianism of the state:
# [[Central banking|Money monopoly]]
# [[Land monopoly]]
# [[Tariff]]s
# [[Patent]]s

Tucker believed that his contemporary millionaires received their wealth through the exploitation of monopolies.{{sfn|Yarros|1936|p=475}}

For several decades, his focus became the state's economic control of how [[trade]] could take place and what [[currency]] counted as legitimate. He saw [[interest]] and [[Profit (economics)|profit]] as a form of exploitation, made possible by the [[banking]] monopoly, in turn maintained through coercion and invasion. Tucker called any such interest and profit [[usury]] and saw it as the basis of the oppression of the workers. In his words, "interest is theft, Rent Robbery, and Profit Only Another Name for Plunder".<ref>Martin Blatt, ''Benjamin R. Tucker and the Champions of Liberty''. Coughlin, Hamilton and Sullivan (eds.), p. 29.</ref>

Tucker opposed [[protectionism]], believing that tariffs caused high prices by preventing national producers from having to compete with foreign competitors. He believed that [[free trade]] would help keep prices low and therefore would assist laborers in receiving what he called their "natural wage". Tucker objected to the exploitation of individuals and explained that only under anarchism will man be truly free, saying: "When interest, rent, and profit disappear under the influence of free money, free land, and free trade, it will make no difference whether men work for themselves, or are employed, or employ others. In any case they can get nothing but that wage for their labor which free competition determines".<ref name="Madison, Charles A."/>

=== Later embrace of egoism ===

[[File:Liberty OldPeriodical.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[List of anarchist periodicals|anarchist periodical]] ''[[Liberty (anarchist periodical)|Liberty]]'' published by Tucker reflected the latter embrace of [[egoist anarchism]] in the 1880s, causing a conflict between egoists like Tucker and [[Lysander Spooner|Spoonerian]] [[natural law]]yers]]

Tucker came to hold the position that no rights exist until they are created by contract. This led him to controversial positions such as claiming that infants had no rights and were the property of their parents because they did not have the ability to contract. He said that a person, who physically tries to stop a mother from throwing her "baby into the fire", should be punished for violating her property rights. For example, he said that children would shed their status as property when they became old enough to contract "to buy or sell a house", noting that the precocity varies by age and would be determined by a jury in the case of a complaint.<ref>McElroy, Wendy (2003). ''The Debates of Liberty''. Lexington Books. pp. 77–79.</ref>
