'''Placide Frans Tempels''', OFM (18 February 1906 &ndash; 9 October 1977) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Franciscan]] [[missionary]] in the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]] who became famous for his book ''[[Bantu Philosophy]]''.

==Life==
Tempels was born in [[Berlaar]], [[Belgium]].  Born Frans Tempels, he took the name "Placide" on his entry into a [[Franciscan]] [[seminary]] in 1924.  After his ordination to the [[Catholic priesthood|priesthood]] in 1930 he taught for a short time in Belgium before being posted to the [[Belgian Congo]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) in 1933.  He stayed there for twenty-nine years, broken by only two short stays back in Belgium.  In April 1962 he returned to live in a Franciscan [[monastery]] in Hasselt, where he died in 1977.

==''Bantu Philosophy''==
{{Main|Bantu Philosophy}}

Though neither [[Africa]]n nor a [[philosopher]], Tempels had a huge influence on [[African philosophy]] through the publication in 1945 of his book ''La philosophie bantoue'', published in the [[English language]] in 1959 as ''Bantu Philosophy''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bantu philosophy (édition anglaise) |url=https://www.presenceafricaine.com/philosophie-afrique-philosophe-africain/646-bantu-philosophy-2708700642.html |access-date=2024-09-03 |website=www.presenceafricaine.com}}</ref> {{citation needed||date=May 2023}}

==''Philosophie bantoue''==
Also in 1945, the ''Philosophie bantoue'' was published by Father Placide Tempels and immediately triggered a voracious debate among African philosophers, including [[Alexis Kagame]] and [[Mubabinge Bilolo]]. [[Paulin Hountondji]] disdainfully called Tempels' ideas ''ethnophilosophies'' and as such nothing more than a classical ethnological study of Africa and its peoples.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Regimes of Comparatism: Frameworks of Comparison in History, Religion and Anthropology | editor1=Geoffrey Lloyd | editor2= Renaud Gagné | editor3= Simon Goldhill |publisher=  Brill |year=2017 |isbn= 9789004387638 | pages=407}}</ref>
