'''Mihailo Marković''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Михаило Марковић}}; 24 February 1923 – 7 February 2010) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] philosopher who gained prominence in the 1960s and 1970s as a proponent of the [[Praxis School]], a [[Marxist humanism|Marxist humanist]] movement that originated in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

He was a member of the Socialist Party of Serbia, co-author of the [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|SANU Memorandum]] and a prominent supporter of [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s politics in the late 1980s and 1990s.

==Early life==
Marković was born in [[Belgrade]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. He became a member of the youth organization of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ) in 1940, and in 1944 he became a member of the KPJ itself. As a [[Yugoslav partisans|partisan]] he actively participated in the struggle for [[liberation of Yugoslavia]] during [[World War II]].<ref name="Book">{{cite book |last1=Mihailo |first1=Marković |last2=Petrović |first2=Gajo |title=Praxis: Yugoslav Essays in the Philosophy and Methodology of the Social Sciences, Volume 36 |date=1979 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-9-0277-0727-7 |page=392 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEFI4Qa5_CAC&pg=PA392}}</ref>

==Academic career==
Marković took a doctorate in philosophy first at the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] in 1955, and then another in 1956 at [[University College London]].<ref name="Book" /> There he studied [[logic]] under [[A. J. Ayer]], and wrote his thesis on ''The Concept of Logic''. In 1963 he became a full professor of philosophy at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy, and the dean of the faculty in the period 1966–1967. From 1960 to 1962 he was the president of the Yugoslav Society of Philosophy.<ref name="Book" /> In the 1970s, he taught at the [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sheldon |first1=Garrett Ward |title=The History of Political Theory: Ancient Greece to Modern America |date=1988 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=978-0-8204-0848-4 |page=191}}</ref> and was a director of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade.<ref name="Book" /> He also taught for many years at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], first as a frequent visiting professor from 1972 to 1980 and then as an adjunct professor from 1981 to 1993. Marković was a co-Chairman of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (1975–1985). He has been a corresponding member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] since 1963 and a full member since 1983.

In his honour, a collection of articles entitled ''Philosophy and Society'' was published in Belgrade in 1987.

==Social critic==
After the Resolution of the [[Informbiro]] condemning the Yugoslav communist regime, Marković took part in a fierce debate against [[Stalinist]] dogmatism, becoming one of the fiercest critics of the Stalinist philosophical theses. His ''Revision of the Philosophical Bases of Marxism in the USSR'', published in 1952, was the first major attack on the Stalinist philosophy in Yugoslavia.

In the 1960s Marković became a major proponent of the [[Praxis School]] of Marxist interpretation, which emphasized the writings of young Marx, and their dialectical and humanist aspects in particular.<ref name="Fuchs">{{cite journal |last1=Fuchs |first1=Christian |title=The Praxis School's Marxist Humanism and Mihailo Marković's Theory of Communication |journal=Critique: Journal of Socialist Theory |date=2017 |volume=45 |issue=1–2 |pages=159–182 |doi=10.1080/03017605.2016.1268456 |s2cid=47004328 |url=http://fuchs.uti.at/wp-content/uploads/praxis.pdf}}</ref> He also actively contributed to the international journal ''Praxis''. Due to his critical observations, together with seven other professors from the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade, Marković was suspended in January 1975, and finally lost his job in January 1981.<ref name="Fuchs" /> After that, Marković worked in the Institute of Social Research until his retirement in 1986.

As a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) in 1986, Marković, together with others, wrote the [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|SANU Memorandum]], a document that has formulated the central tenets of Serbian nationalism.<ref>{{cite web |title=SANU Memorandum Author Testifies |url=https://iwpr.net/global-voices/sanu-memorandum-author-testifies |website=iwpr.net |publisher=Coalition for International Justice (CIJ) |date=16 November 2004}}</ref> While the document has been viewed in some neighbouring former Yugoslav republics as a preparation for full-scale Greater Serbian expansionism, many Serbs considered it a realistic depiction of the Serbian position within Yugoslav federation.

During the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]], Marković considered that the borders of the country should be changed based on ethnic and historical grounds. Marković considered that the [[quasi-state]] [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], eastern [[Slavonia]], [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]] and western [[Syrmia]] should not belong to [[Croatia]] because the Serbian people have lived in these territories for most of the centuries. He also considered that "the Albanian people lack any historical reasons to support their right to [[Kosovo]]", as they did not live in the territory before the arrival of the Slavs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Milosavljević |first1=Olivera |title=Ogledi broj 1: U tradiciji nacionalizma ili stereotipi srpskih intelektualaca XX veka o "nama" i "drugima" |url=https://www.helsinki.org.rs/serbian/doc/Ogledi01.pdf |publisher=Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia |page=123 |language=Serbian |date=2002}}</ref>

==Political activity==
Marković was vice-president of the [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] from 1990 to 1992, as well as its one time chief ideologue. At other times, he was a vocal critic of the official SPS party line. In November 1995 he was released from all duties in the party.<ref>[http://scindeks-clanci.nb.rs/data/pdf/0353-5738/2010/0353-57381001003M.pdf ''Praxis – critical thinking and acting'', 2009 interview with Mihailo Marković] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826204410/http://scindeks-clanci.nb.rs/data/pdf/0353-5738/2010/0353-57381001003M.pdf |date=26 August 2011 }} (in Serbian)</ref>
