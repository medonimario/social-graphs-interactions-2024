==Biography==
===Family===
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Mirandola, 1976) - BEIC 6329210.jpg|thumb|left|[[Castle of Mirandola]] in 1976]]
Giovanni was born at [[Mirandola]], near [[Modena]], the youngest son of [[Gianfrancesco I Pico]], [[duchy of Mirandola|Lord of Mirandola]] and Count of [[Concordia sulla Secchia|Concordia]], by his wife Giulia, daughter of Feltrino [[Matteo Maria Boiardo|Boiardo]], Count of [[Scandiano]].<ref name="genealogy.euweb.cz">{{cite web

Mirandola was a small autonomous county (later, a duchy) in [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], near [[Ferrara]]. The Pico della Mirandola were closely related to the [[Sforza]], [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] and [[House of Este|Este]] dynasties, and Giovanni's siblings wed the descendants of the hereditary rulers of [[Corsica]], Ferrara, Bologna, and [[Forlì]].<ref name="genealogy.euweb.cz"/>

Born twenty-three years into his parents' marriage, Giovanni had two much older brothers, both of whom outlived him: Count [[Galeotto I Pico|Galeotto I]] continued the dynasty, while Antonio became a general in the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] army.<ref name="genealogy.euweb.cz"/> The Pico family would reign as dukes until Mirandola, an ally of [[Louis XIV of France]], was conquered by his rival, [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor]], in 1708 and annexed to Modena by Duke [[Rinaldo d'Este, Duke of Modena|Rinaldo d'Este]], the exiled [[patrilineality|male line]] becoming extinct in 1747.<ref>{{cite book| last = Schoell| first = M.| title = History of the Revolutions in Europe| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tiEMAAAAYAAJ&q=%22history+of+the+revolutions+in+europe+from+the+subversion%22| access-date = 2008-03-09| year = 1837| publisher = S.

Giovanni's maternal family was singularly distinguished in the arts and scholarship of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. His cousin and contemporary was the poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, who grew up under the influence of his own uncle, the Florentine [[Gaius Maecenas|patron of the arts]] and scholar-poet [[Tito Vespasiano Strozzi]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.geocities.com/autorbis/boiardolife.html|title= Trionfi.com|access-date= 2008-03-09|work= Boiardo's Life: Time Table|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806060236/http://geocities.com/autorbis/boiardolife.html|archive-date=6 August 2009}}</ref>

Giovanni had a paradoxical relationship with his nephew [[Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola]], who was a great admirer of his uncle, yet published ''Examen vanitatis doctrinae gentium'' (1520) in opposition to the "ancient wisdom narrative" espoused by Giovanni, described by historian Charles B. Schmitt as an attempt "to destroy what his uncle had built."<ref>Hanegraff p. 80</ref>

===Education===
[[File:L'enfance de Pic de la Mirandole.jpg|thumb|right|''The Childhood of Pico della Mirandola'' by [[Hippolyte Delaroche]], 1842, [[Musée d'Arts de Nantes]]]]
A precocious child with an exceptional memory, Giovanni was schooled in Latin and possibly Greek at a very early age. Intended for the [[Catholic Church|Church]] by his mother, he was named a papal protonotary (probably honorary) at the age of 10 and in 1477, he went to Bologna to study [[canon law]].<ref name="Baird">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitworth.edu/core/classes/co250/Italy/Data/fr_pico.htm |title=Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494) |last=Baird |first=Forrest |year=2000 |work=Philosophic Classics |publisher=Prentice Hall |access-date=2009-01-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202004135/http://www.whitworth.edu/Core/Classes/CO250/Italy/Data/fr_pico.htm |archive-date=2 December 2008 }}</ref>

At the sudden death of his mother three years later, Pico renounced canon law and began to study philosophy at the [[University of Ferrara]].<ref name="Baird"/> During a brief trip to Florence, he met [[Angelo Poliziano]], the [[courtly]] poet [[Girolamo Benivieni]], and probably the young Dominican friar [[Girolamo Savonarola]]. For the rest of his life, he remained very close friends with all three.<ref name="bbcexhume">{{Cite news |title=Medici writers exhumed in Italy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6920443.stm |access-date=2015-12-11 |periodical=[[BBC News]] |date=28 July 2007}}</ref> He may also have been a lover of Poliziano.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death in Florence|last=Strathern|first=Paul|publisher=Jonathan Cape|year=2011|isbn=978-0224089784|location=London|pages=84}}</ref>

From 1480 to 1482, he continued his studies at the [[University of Padua]], a major centre of [[Aristotelianism]] in Italy.<ref name="Baird"/> Already proficient in Latin and Greek, he studied Hebrew and Arabic in [[Padua]] with [[Elia del Medigo]], a Jewish [[Averroist]], and read Aramaic manuscripts with him as well. Del Medigo also translated [[Rabbinic literature|Judaic manuscripts]] from Hebrew into Latin for Pico, as he would continue to do for a number of years. Pico also wrote [[sonnet]]s in Latin and Italian which, because of the influence of Savonarola, he destroyed at the end of his life.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

He spent the next four years either at home or visiting [[Humanism|humanist]] centres elsewhere in Italy. In 1485, he travelled to the [[University of Paris]], the most important centre in Europe for [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophy and theology, and a hotbed of secular Averroism. It was probably in Paris that Giovanni began his ''900 Theses'' and conceived the idea of defending them in public debate.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

===''900 Theses''===
{{blockquote|THE CONCLUSIONS will not be disputed until after the Epiphany. In the meantime they will be published in all Italian universities. And if any philosopher or theologian, even from the ends of Italy, wishes to come to Rome for the sake of debating, his lord the disputer promises to pay the travel expenses from his own funds.|Announcement at the end of the ''900 Theses''<ref>Farmer pg. ix</ref>}}
[[File:Lorenzo el Magnífico, por Giorgio Vasari.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lorenzo de' Medici]] by [[Giorgio Vasari]], c. 1533–1534]]
During this time two life-changing events occurred. The first was when he returned to settle for a time in [[Florence]] in November 1484 and met [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] and [[Marsilio Ficino]]. It was an [[Astrology|astrologically]] auspicious day that Ficino had chosen to publish his translations of the works of Plato from Greek into Latin, under Lorenzo's enthusiastic patronage. Pico appears to have charmed both men, and despite Ficino's philosophical differences, he was convinced of their Saturnine affinity and the divine providence of his arrival. Lorenzo would support and protect Pico until his death in 1492.

{{Hermeticism|expand=Historical figures}}
Soon after this stay in Florence, Pico was travelling on his way to Rome where he intended to publish his ''900 Theses'' and prepare for a congress of scholars from all over Europe to debate them. Stopping in [[Arezzo]] he became embroiled in a love affair with the wife of one of Lorenzo de' Medici's cousins, which almost cost him his life. Giovanni attempted to run off with the woman, but he was caught, wounded and thrown into prison by her husband. He was released only upon the intervention of Lorenzo himself.

Pico spent several months in [[Perugia]] and nearby Fratta, recovering from his injuries. It was there, as he wrote to Ficino, that "divine Providence ... caused certain books to fall into my hands. They are [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean]] books ... of [[Esdras]], of [[Zoroaster]] and of [[Biblical Magi|Melchior]], oracles of the magi, which contain a brief and dry interpretation of Chaldean philosophy, but full of mystery."<ref name="lyber-eclat">{{cite web|url=http://www.lyber-eclat.net/lyber/mirandola/picbio.html |title=Bibliographie Giovanni Pico della Mirandola |publisher=lyber-eclat.net|access-date=21 March 2016}}</ref> Pico was introduced in Perugia to the mystical Hebrew ''[[Kabbalah]]'', which fascinated him, as did the late classical Hermetic writers, such as [[Hermes Trismegistus]]. The ''Kabbalah'' and ''Hermetica'' were thought in Pico's time to be as ancient as the Old Testament. Pico's "tutor" in Kabbalah was [[Yohanan Alemanno|Rabbi Johannan Alemanno]] (1430s – c. 1510), who argued that the study and mastery of magic was to be regarded as the final stage of one's intellectual and spiritual education.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Chajes|first1=J. H.

This contact, initiated as a result of Christian interest in probing the ancient wisdom found in Jewish mystical sources, resulted in unprecedented mutual influence between Jewish and Christian Renaissance thought.<ref name=":0" /> The most original of Pico's 900 theses concerned the ''Kabbalah''. As a result, he became the founder of the tradition known as [[Christian Kabbalah]], which went on to be a central part of early modern [[Western esotericism]].<ref name="Hanegraaff p.54"/> Pico's approach to different philosophies was one of extreme [[syncretism]], placing them in parallel, it has been claimed, rather than attempting to describe a developmental history.<ref>Hanegraaff, pg. 59</ref>

Pico based his ideas chiefly on Plato, as did his teacher, Marsilio Ficino, but retained a deep respect for Aristotle. Although he was a product of the ''studia humanitatis'', Pico was constitutionally an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], and in some respects he represented a reaction against the exaggerations of pure humanism, defending what he believed to be the best of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and Islamic commentators, such as [[Averroes]] and [[Avicenna]], on Aristotle in a famous long letter to [[Ermolao Barbaro]] in 1485. It was always Pico's aim to reconcile the schools of Plato and Aristotle since he believed they used different words to express the same concepts. It was perhaps for this reason his friends called him "Princeps Concordiae", or "Prince of Harmony" (a pun on Prince of Concordia, one of his family's holdings).<ref>Paul Oskar Kristeller, Eight Philosophers of the Italian Renaissance. Stanford University Press (Stanford, California, 1964.) p. 62.</ref> Similarly, Pico believed that an educated person should also study Hebrew and [[Talmudic]] sources, and the Hermetics, because he thought they represented the same concept of God that is seen in the [[Old Testament]], but in different words.

He finished his "Oration on the Dignity of Man" to accompany his ''900 Theses'' and travelled to Rome to continue his plan to defend them. He had them published together in December 1486 as ''"Conclusiones philosophicae, cabalasticae et theologicae"'', and offered to pay the expenses of any scholars who came to Rome to debate them publicly. He wanted the debate to begin on 6 January, which was, as historian Steven Farmer has observed, the feast of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and "symbolic date of the submission of the pagan gentes to Christ in the persons of the Magi". After emerging victorious at the culmination of the debate, Pico planned not only on the symbolic acquiescence of the pagan sages, but also the conversion of Jews as they realised that Jesus was the true secret of their traditions. According to Farmer, Pico may have been expecting quite literally that "his Vatican debate would end with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse crashing through the Roman skies".<ref>Hanegraaff p. 57</ref>

[[File:Innocent VIII 1492.JPG|thumb|left|Innocent VIII, 15th century]]
In February 1487, [[Pope Innocent VIII]] halted the proposed debate, and established a commission to review the orthodoxy of the ''900 Theses''. Although Pico answered the charges against them, thirteen theses were condemned. Pico agreed in writing to retract them, but he did not change his mind about their validity. Eventually, all 900 theses were condemned. He proceeded to write an ''[[apologia]]'' defending them, ''Apologia J. Pici Mirandolani, Concordiae comitis'', published in 1489, which he dedicated to his patron, Lorenzo. When the pope was apprised of the circulation of this manuscript, he set up an inquisitorial tribunal, forcing Pico to renounce the ''Apologia'', in addition to his condemned theses, which he agreed to do. The pope [[Theological censure|censured]] ''900 Theses'' as:

{{blockquote|In part heretical, in part the flower of heresy; several are scandalous and offensive to pious ears; most do nothing but reproduce the errors of pagan philosophers [...] others are capable of inflaming the impertinence of the Jews; a number of them, finally, under the pretext of 'natural philosophy', favour arts [i.e., [[Christian views on magic|magic]]<ref name="Hanegraaff p.54"/>] that are enemies to the Catholic faith and to the human race.<ref name="Lybereclatnetopcit">Lyber-eclat.net ''op.cit.''</ref>}}

This was the first time that a printed book had been banned by the Church, and nearly all copies were burned.<ref name="Hanegraaff p.54"/> Pico fled to France in 1488, where he was arrested by [[Philip II, Duke of Savoy]], at the demand of the papal [[nuncio]]s, and imprisoned at [[Vincennes]]. Through the intercession of several Italian princes – all instigated by Lorenzo de' Medici – King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] had him released, and the pope was persuaded to allow Pico to move to Florence and to live under Lorenzo's protection. But he was not cleared of the papal censures and restrictions until 1493, after the accession of [[Alexander VI]] (Rodrigo Borgia) to the papacy.

The experience deeply shook Pico. He reconciled with Savonarola, who remained a very close friend. It was at Pico's persuasion that Lorenzo invited Savonarola to Florence. But Pico never renounced his syncretist convictions. He settled in a villa near [[Fiesole]] prepared for him by Lorenzo, where he wrote and published the ''Heptaplus id est de Dei creatoris opere'' (1489) and ''De Ente et Uno'' (''Of Being and Unity'', 1491). It was here that he also wrote his other most celebrated work, the ''Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinicatrium'' (''Treatise Against Predictive Astrology''), which was not published until after his death. In it, Pico acidly condemned the deterministic practices of the astrologers of his day.

After the death of Lorenzo de' Medici, in 1492, Pico moved to Ferrara, although he continued to visit Florence. In Florence, political instability gave rise to the increasing influence of Savonarola, whose reactionary opposition to Renaissance expansion and style had already brought about conflict with the Medici family (they eventually were expelled from Florence) and would lead to the wholesale destruction of books and paintings. Nevertheless, Pico became a follower of Savonarola. Determined to become a monk, he dismissed his former interest in Egyptian and Chaldean texts, destroyed his own poetry and gave away his fortune.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Borchardt|first1=Frank L.|title=The Magus as Renaissance Man|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|date=1 January 1990|volume=21|issue=1|page=70|doi=10.2307/2541132|jstor=2541132}}</ref>

It was rumoured that his own secretary had poisoned him because Pico had become too close to Savonarola.<ref name="Lybereclatnetopcit" /> He was interred together with Girolamo Benivieni at San Marco, and Savonarola delivered the funeral oration. Ficino wrote: {{blockquote|Our dear Pico left us on the same day that Charles VIII was entering Florence, and the tears of men of letters compensated for the joy of the people. Without the light brought by the king of France, Florence might perhaps have never seen a more somber day than that which extinguished Mirandola's light.<ref name="Lybereclatnetopcit" />}}

In 2007, the bodies of Poliziano and Pico were exhumed from the [[San Marco, Florence|Church of San Marco]] in Florence to establish the causes of their deaths.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6920443.stm Medici writers exhumed in Italy].

{{Neoplatonism}}
In the ''Oratio de hominis dignitate'' (''Oration on the Dignity of Man'', 1486), Pico justified the importance of the human quest for knowledge, masterfully blending [[Neoplatonism]] and Aristotelian [[Scholasticism]].<ref>[https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/pico-della-mirandola-oration-on-the-dignity-of-man-a-new-translation-and-commentary/term= Pico della Mirandola: Oration on the Dignity of Man: A New Translation and Commentary]. Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews. Accessed 3 November 2024.</ref>

The ''Oration'' also served as an introduction to Pico's 900 theses, which he believed to provide a complete and sufficient basis for the discovery of all knowledge, and hence a model for mankind's ascent of the chain of being. The 900 Theses are a good example of humanist syncretism, because Pico combined [[Platonism]], Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, [[Hermeticism]] and Kabbalah. They also included 72 theses describing what Pico believed to be a complete system of physics.

Pico's ''De animae immortalitate'' (Paris, 1541), and other works, developed the doctrine that man's possession of an [[immortal soul]] freed him from the hierarchical stasis. Pico believed in [[universal reconciliation]], as one of his 900 theses was "A mortal sin of finite duration is not deserving of eternal but only of temporal punishment;" it was among the theses pronounced heretical by Pope Innocent VIII in his bull of 4 August 1487.<ref>"[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc01.html?term=Apocatastasis Apocatastasis]". ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. I''.</ref>

In the ''Oration'' he argues, in the words of [[Pier Cesare Bori]], that "human vocation is a mystical vocation that has to be realized following a three-stage way, which comprehends necessarily moral transformation, intellectual research and final perfection in the identity with the absolute reality. This paradigm is universal, because it can be retraced in every tradition."<ref>Prof. Pier Cesare Bori. "[http://didattica.spbo.unibo.it/pais/bori/articolo010.html The Italian Renaissance: An Unfinished Dawn?: Pico della Mirandola] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229231307/http://didattica.spbo.unibo.it/pais/bori/articolo010.html |date=29 December 2007 }}". Accessed 5 December 2007.</ref>

A portion of his ''Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem'' was published in Bologna after his death. In this book, Pico presents arguments against the practice of [[astrology]] that have had enormous resonance for centuries, up to our own time. ''Disputationes'' is influenced by the arguments against astrology espoused by one of his intellectual heroes, [[Augustine of Hippo]], and also by the medieval philosophical tale [[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|''Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān'']] by [[ibn Tufail]], which promoted [[autodidacticism]] as a philosophical program.<ref>see Ben-Zaken, Avner, "Defying Authority, Rejecting Predestination and Conquering Nature", in ''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0801897394/ref=rdr_ext_tmb Reading Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan: A Cross-Cultural History of Autodidacticism]'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2011), pp. 65–100.</ref>

Pico's antagonism to astrology seems to derive mainly from the conflict of astrology with Christian notions of free will. But Pico's arguments moved beyond the objections of Ficino, who was himself an astrologer. The manuscript was edited for publication after Pico's death by his nephew [[Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola]], an ardent follower of Savonarola, and may possibly have been amended to be more forcefully critical. This might possibly explain the fact that Ficino championed the manuscript and enthusiastically endorsed it before its publication.

Early in his career, Pico wrote a ''Commento sopra una canzone d'amore di Girolamo Benivieni'', in which he revealed his plan to write a book entitled ''Poetica Theologia'':<ref>Butorac, pg. 357</ref>{{blockquote|It was the opinion of the ancient theologians that divine subjects and the secret Mysteries must not be rashly divulged... the Egyptians had sculpted sphinxes in all their temples, for no other reason than to indicate that divine things, even when they are committed to writing, must be covered with enigmatic veils and poetic dissimulation... How that was done... by Latin and Greek poets we shall explain in the book of our Poetic Theology.|''Commento'', Libro Terzo, Cap. xi, Stanza Nona<ref>Hanegraaff, pg. 64</ref>}}

Pico's ''Heptaplus'', a mystical-allegorical exposition of the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] according to the seven Biblical senses, elaborates on his idea that different religions and traditions describe the same God. The book is written in his characteristic [[Christian apologetics|apologetic]] and polemic style:{{blockquote|If they agree with us anywhere, we shall order the Hebrews to stand by the ancient traditions of their fathers; if anywhere they disagree, then drawn up in Catholic legions we shall make an attack upon them. In short, whatever we detect foreign to the truth of the Gospels we shall refute to the extent of our power, while whatever we find holy and true we shall bear off from the synagogue, as from a wrongful possessor, to ourselves, the legitimate Israelites.|''Heptaplus'', Proem to 3rd exposition<ref>Hanegraaff, pg. 58</ref>}}

''On Being and the One'' ({{langx|la|De ente et uno}}) has explanations of several passages in the [[Pentateuch]], Plato and Aristotle. It is an attempted reconciliation between Platonic and Aristotelian writings on the relative places of being and "[[henology|the one]]" and a refutation of opposing arguments.

He wrote in Italian an imitation of Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''. His letters (''Aureae ad familiares epistolae'' Paris, 1499) are important for the history of contemporary thought. The many editions of his entire works in the sixteenth century sufficiently prove his influence.

Another notorious text by Pico is ''De omnibus rebus et de quibusdam aliis'' ("Of all things that exist and a little more"), which is mentioned in some entries on Thomas More's ''[[Utopia (More book)|Utopia]]'' and makes fun of the title of Lucretius' ''[[De rerum natura]]''.

*The beardless young man in [[Raphael]]'s [[fresco]] ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509–11) is thought to be Pico della Mirandola (or maybe [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Duke of Urbino|Francesco della Rovere]]).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRY6rgYan00C&q=%22Pico+della+Mirandola%22+%22school+of+athens%22&pg=PR15|title=Group Identity in the Renaissance World|first=Hannah Chapelle|last=Wojciehowski|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1107003606|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yzH9CwAAQBAJ&q=%22Pico+della+Mirandola%22+%22school+of+athens%22&pg=PA69|title=Reading Cy Twombly: Poetry in Paint|first=Mary|last=Jacobus|year=2016|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1400883288|via=Google Books}}</ref> [[Christiane Joost-Gaugier]] described Pico della Mirandola as "a major philosophical inspiration of the fresco's program, especially insofar as he was the most outspoken proponent of the harmony of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SC7Id_HAa7IC&q=%22Pico+della+Mirandola%22+%22school+of+athens%22&pg=PA158|title=Vision and the Visionary in Raphael|first=Christian K.|last=Kleinbub|date=2019|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0271037042|via=Google Books}}</ref>
* In [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', the precocious [[Stephen Dedalus]] recalls with disdain his boyhood ambitions, and apparently associates them with the career of Mirandola: "Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply deep...copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the world...Pico della Mirandola like."<ref>Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080912051649/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/j/joyce/james/j8u/section3.html ebooks.adelaide.edu.au]  (accessed: 15 September 2010)</ref>
* Of minor interest is a passing reference to Mirandola by [[H. P. Lovecraft]], in the story ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]'' (1927). Mirandola is given as the source of the fearsome incantation used by unknown evil entities as some sort of evocation. However, this "spell" was first depicted (as the key to a rather simple form of divination, not a great and terrible summoning) by, and in all likelihood created by, [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim]] in his ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]''. This was written several decades after Mirandola's death and was the first written example of that "spell", so it is almost impossible for Mirandola to have been the source of those "magic words".
* Psychoanalyst [[Otto Rank]], a rebellious disciple of [[Sigmund Freud]], chose a substantial excerpt from Mirandola's ''Oration on the Dignity of Man'' as the motto for his book ''Art and Artist: Creative Urge and Personality Development'', including: "...I created thee as a being neither celestial nor earthly... so that thou shouldst be thy own free moulder and overcomer...".<ref>Rank, Otto, ''Art and Artist: Creative Urge and Personality Development'', Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1932.</ref>
* In [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' the protagonist Casaubon claims that the idea that the Jews were privy to the enigma of the Templars was "a mistake of Pico Della Mirandola" caused by a spelling mistake he made between "Israelites" and "Ismaelites."
* In [[Irving Stone]]'s novel about [[Michelangelo]], ''[[The Agony and the Ecstasy (novel)|The Agony and the Ecstasy]]'', book 3, part 3 contains a paragraph's description of Mirandola as part of the scholarly circle that surrounded [[Lorenzo di Medici]] in Florence. Mirandola was described as a man who spoke 22 languages, was deeply read in philosophy, and someone who made no enemies.
* Philosopher of social science [[René Girard]] mentions Mirandola passingly in his book ''Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde'' (''[[Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World]]''), Girard writes in a disparaging tone, "People will accuse us of playing at being Pico della Mirandola{{snd}}the renaissance man{{snd}}certainly a temptation to be resisted today, if we wish to be seen in a favourable light." (p.&nbsp;141, 1987)
* In [[Roberto Bolaño]]'s novel ''2666'', the philosophy professor Oscar Amalfitano begins his three-columned list of philosophers with Pico della Mirandola. Adjacent to Mirandola, Amalfitano writes [[Hobbes]], while beneath him he writes [[Husserl]] (p.&nbsp;207, 2008).
* In [[Frédéric Lenoir]]'s novel ''L'Oracle della Luna'' (2006), the philosophy of Pico della Mirandola forms one of the major teachings acquired by the protagonist, Giovanni, from his main spiritual Master. The year is 1530. The major mentions are:
** at the end of Chapter 21 the sage – a fictitious character – says he has personally met Pico della Mirandola and discusses Mirandola's disagreement with the pope about the 900 Theses (with Lenoir stating that only 7 of them had not been accepted) and the philosopher's later fate. In the words of the sage, the main goal of Ficino and Pico della Mirandola was to acquire universal knowledge, free from prejudice and from linguistic and religious barriers;
** at the end of Chapter 24, having discussed [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s concept of free will{{clarify|date=August 2019}}, the sage wants to acquaint Giovanni with Mirandola's ideas on this issue and lets him read "De hominis dignitate"; Giovanni peruses the book with great interest in Chapter 25;
** at the beginning of Chapter 26, with Giovanni having now read the ''Oration on the Dignity of Man'', the sage discusses two issues from the book with him. One is Pico della Mirandola's attempt to form one unified and universal philosophy and the difficulties thereof. The other one is Mirandola's concept of free will. Giovanni has learnt one passage from the book by heart, about God addressing man and telling him, that He has made him neither a heavenly nor an earthly creature and that man is the forger of his own fate. This passage is quoted in the novel.
* English composer [[Gavin Bryars]] made use of the texts of Pico della Mirandola in his musical production; most notably in pieces like "Glorious Hill", for vocal quartet/mixed choir, "Pico's Flight", for soprano and orchestra, and "Incipit Vita Nova" for alto and string trio.
* Pico della Mirandola appears as the character Ikaros in [[Jo Walton]]'s novels ''[[The Just City]]'' and ''[[The Philosopher Kings (novel)|The Philosopher Kings]]''. Also, he is one of the main characters in her novel ''[[Lent (novel)|Lent]]''.
* In the book ''Dying for Ideas; The Dangerous Lives of the Philosophers'' (2015) by Romanian philosopher [[Costica Bradatan]], Mirandola's life and work is taken as an early or even first example of taking human life as a project of 'self-fashioning', relating this to Mirandola's heretic idea of man being part of creation with 'an indefinite nature'.
* Pico della Mirandola is the protagonist in the short story by [[Jack Dann]] "[[The Glass Casket]]", which was published as a part of the [[Snow White, Blood Red (book)|Snow White, Blood Red]] anthology.
*In the graphic novel [[All-Star Superman]] by [[Grant Morrison]] Giovanni Pico della Mirandola can be seen reciting a part of the [[Oration on the Dignity of Man]].
