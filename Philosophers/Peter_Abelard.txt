In philosophy, he is celebrated for his logical solution to the [[problem of universals]] via [[nominalism]] and [[conceptualism]] and his pioneering of [[intent]] in ethics.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Marenbon |first=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLeahWCX8BkC&q=The+Philosophy+of+Peter+Abelard |title=The Philosophy of Peter Abelard |date=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-66399-1 |language=en}}</ref> Often referred to as the "[[René Descartes|Descartes]] of the twelfth century", he is considered a forerunner of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.versopolis.com/long-read/587/enlightenment-as-a-harmonious-strategy |title=Enlightenment as a Harmonious Strategy |website=Versopolis |first=Robert |last=Menasse |date=22 March 2018 |access-date=31 March 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401004614/http://www.versopolis.com/long-read/587/enlightenment-as-a-harmonious-strategy |archive-date=1 April 2018 }}</ref> He is sometimes credited as a chief forerunner of modern [[empiricism]].<ref>Gans, Eric.

In history and popular culture, he is best known for his passionate and tragic love affair, and [[Letters of Abelard and Heloise|intense philosophical exchange]], with his brilliant student and eventual wife, [[Héloïse|Héloïse d'Argenteuil]]. He was a defender of women and of their education. After having sent Héloïse to a [[convent]] in Brittany to protect her from her abusive uncle who did not want her to pursue this forbidden love, he was castrated by men sent by the uncle. Still considering herself as his spouse even though both retired to monasteries after this event, Héloïse publicly defended him when his doctrine was condemned by [[Pope Innocent II]] and Abelard considered a heretic. Among these opinions, Abelard professed the innocence of a woman who commits a sin out of love.<ref>E. Gilson, La morale de l'amour pur, in Abélard et Héloïse, éd. E. Bouyé, Correspondance, p. 30–31, Folio Gallimard, Paris.</ref>

In [[Catholic theology]], he is best known for his development of the concept of [[limbo]], and his introduction of the [[moral influence theory of atonement]]. He is considered (alongside [[Augustine of Hippo]]) to be the most significant forerunner of the modern self-reflective autobiographer. He paved the way and set the tone for later [[epistolary novel]]s and celebrity tell-alls with his publicly distributed letter, ''[[Historia Calamitatum|The History of My Calamities]]'', and public correspondence.

In law, Abelard stressed that, because the subjective intention determines the moral value of human action, the legal consequence of an action is related to the person who commits it and not merely to the action. With this doctrine, Abelard created in the [[Middle Ages]] the idea of the individual subject central to modern law. This eventually gave to School of Notre-Dame de Paris (later the [[University of Paris]]) a recognition for its expertise in the area of Law (and later led to the creation of a [[Faculty of Law of Paris]]).

== Early life ==
[[File:Abaelard.jpg|thumb|Page from ''Apologia contra Bernardum'', Abelard's reply to [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]]]
Abelard, originally called "Pierre le Pallet", was born {{circa|1079}} in [[Le Pallet]],<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Abelard, Peter |edition=15th |year=2010 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/25 25–26] |url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/25 }}</ref> about 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) east of [[Nantes]], in the [[Duchy of Brittany]], the eldest son of a minor noble French family. As a boy, he learned quickly. His father, a knight called Berenger, encouraged Abelard  to study the [[liberal arts]], wherein he excelled at the art of [[dialectic]]. Instead of entering a military career, as his father had done, Abelard became an academic.

During his early academic pursuits, Abelard wandered throughout France, debating and learning, so as (in his own words) "he became such a one as the [[Peripatetics]]."<ref name="Calamitatum">{{cite book|title=Historia Calamitatum|last=Abelard|first=Peter|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/abelard-histcal.html|access-date=7 December 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204063034/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/abelard-histcal.html|archive-date=4 December 2008}}</ref> He first studied in the [[Loire]] area, where the [[Nominalism|nominalist]] [[Roscellinus]] of [[Compiègne]], who had been accused of heresy by [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], was his teacher during this period.<ref name="CBD" />

== Career ==
Around 1100, Abelard's travels brought him to Paris. Around this time he changed his surname to Abelard, sometimes written Abailard or Abaelardus. The etymological root of Abelard could be the Middle French {{Lang|frm|abilite}} ('ability'), the Hebrew name ''Abel/Habal'' (breath/vanity/figure in Genesis), the English ''apple'' or the Latin {{Lang|la|ballare}} ('to dance'). The name is jokingly referenced as relating to lard, as in excessive ("fatty") learning, in a secondary anecdote referencing [[Adelard of Bath]] and Peter Abelard (and in which they are confused to be one person).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mews |first1=Constant J. |title=In Search of a Name and Its Significance: A Twelfth-Century Anecdote about Thierry and Peter Abaelard |journal=Traditio |date=1988 |volume=44 |pages=171–200 |doi=10.1017/S0362152900007054 |s2cid=151432795 }}</ref>

In the great cathedral school of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (before the construction of the current cathedral there), he studied under Paris archdeacon and Notre-Dame master [[William of Champeaux]], later bishop of Chalons, a disciple of [[Anselm of Laon]] (not to be confused with [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]]), a leading proponent of [[philosophical realism]].<ref name="CBD" /> Retrospectively, Abelard portrays William as having turned from approval to hostility when Abelard proved soon able to defeat his master in argument. This resulted in a long duel that eventually ended in the downfall of the theory of realism which was replaced by Abelard's theory of [[conceptualism]] / [[nominalism]]. While Abelard's thought was closer to William's thought than this account might suggest,<ref name=Marenbon-15>{{harvnb|Marenbon|2004|p=15}}.</ref> William thought Abelard was too [[pride|arrogant]].<ref name="Sellner2008">{{cite book|author=Edward Cletus Sellner|title=Finding the Monk Within: Great Monastic Values for Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xR7cxJ6mnboC&pg=PA238|year=2008|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=978-1-58768-048-9|pages=238–}}</ref> It was during this time that Abelard would provoke quarrels with both William and Roscellinus.<ref name=EB />

Against opposition from the metropolitan teacher, Abelard set up his own school, first at [[Melun]], a favoured royal residence, then, around 1102–04, for more direct competition, he moved to [[Corbeil-Essonnes|Corbeil]], nearer Paris.<ref name="Calamitatum" /> His teaching was notably successful, but the stress taxed his constitution, leading to a [[nervous breakdown]] and a trip home to Brittany for several years of recovery.

On his return, after 1108, he found William lecturing at the hermitage of Saint-Victor, just outside the [[Île de la Cité]], and there they once again became rivals, with Abelard challenging William over his theory of universals. Abelard was once more victorious, and Abelard was almost able to attain the position of master at Notre Dame. For a short time, however, William was able to prevent Abelard from lecturing in Paris. Abelard accordingly was forced to resume his school at Melun, which he was then able to move, from {{circa|1110–12}}, to Paris itself, on the heights of [[Montagne Sainte-Geneviève]], overlooking Notre-Dame.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Abelard, Peter |first1=Peter George |last1=Croom |last2=Shotwell |first2=James  Thomson |page=40}}</ref>

From his success in dialectic, he next turned to theology and in 1113 moved to [[Laon]] to attend the lectures of [[Anselm of Laon|Anselm]] on Biblical [[exegesis]] and Christian doctrine.<ref name=EB /> Unimpressed by Anselm's teaching, Abelard began to offer his own lectures on the book of Ezekiel. Anselm forbade him to continue this teaching. Abelard returned to Paris where, in around 1115, he became master of the cathedral school of [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] and a canon of [[Sens]] (the cathedral of the archdiocese to which Paris belonged).<ref name="Calamitatum" />

== Works ==

===Philosophy===
{{Catholic philosophy |Postclassical}}
Abelard is considered one of the founders of the secular university and pre-Renaissance secular philosophical thought.<ref>Compayre, Gabriel. Abelard and the Early History of Universities. https://www.google.com/books/edition/Abelard_and_the_Origin_and_Early_History</ref>

Abelard argued for [[conceptualism]] in the theory of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]. (A universal is a quality or property which every individual member of a class of things must possess if the same word is to apply to all the things in that class. Blueness, for example, is a [[universal property]] possessed by all blue objects.) According to Abelard scholar [[David Luscombe]], "Abelard logically elaborated an independent [[philosophy of language]]...[in which] he stressed that language itself is not able to demonstrate the truth of things (res) that lie in the domain of physics."<ref>Luscombe, David. Peter Abelard: French Logician and Poet. https://www.britannica.com/biography/Peter-Abelard/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126044835/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Peter-Abelard |date=26 January 2021 }}</ref>

Writing with the influence of his wife Heloise, he stressed that subjective intention determines the moral value of human action. With Heloise, he is the first significant philosopher of the Middle Ages to push for intentionalist ethics.

He helped establish the philosophical authority of [[Aristotle]], which became firmly established in the half-century after his death. It was at this time that Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]'' first became available, and gradually all of Aristotle's other surviving works. Before this, the works of [[Plato]] were used in support of [[philosophical realism]].

===Theology===
Abelard is considered one of the greatest twelfth-century Catholic philosophers, arguing that God and the universe can and should be known via logic as well as via the emotions. He should not be read as a heretic, as his charges of heresy were dropped and rescinded by the Church after his death, but rather as a cutting-edge philosopher who pushed theology and philosophy to their limits. He is described as "the keenest thinker and boldest theologian of the 12th century"<ref name="CBD">[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, p. 3; {{harvnb|Marenbon|2004|p= 14}}.</ref> and as the greatest logician of the Middle Ages. "His genius was evident in all he did"; as the first to use 'theology' in its modern sense, he championed "reason in matters of faith", and "seemed larger than life to his contemporaries: his quick wit, sharp tongue, perfect memory, and boundless arrogance made him unbeatable in debate" — "the force of his personality impressed itself vividly on all with whom he came into contact."<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=King |first1=Peter |last2=Arlig |first2=Andrew |date=3 August 2004 |title=Peter Abelard |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/abelard/}}</ref>

Regarding the un[[baptized]] who die in [[infancy]], Abelard — in ''Commentaria in Epistolam Pauli ad Romanos'' — emphasized the goodness of God and interpreted [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s "mildest punishment" as the pain of loss at being denied the [[beatific vision]] (''carentia visionis Dei''), without hope of obtaining it, but with no additional punishments. His thought contributed to the forming of [[Limbo of Infants]] theory in the 12th–13th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html|title=The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptised|author=International Theological Commission, the Vatican|access-date=7 December 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222011157/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html|archive-date=22 December 2008}}</ref>

=== Psychology ===
Abelard was concerned with the concept of intent and inner life, developing an elementary [[cognitive psychology|theory of cognition]] in his ''Tractabus De Intellectibus'',<ref>Marenbon, John. The Philosophy of Peter Abelard, 1999</ref> and later developing the concept that human beings "speak to God with their thoughts".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kramer |first1=Susan R. |title='We Speak to God with our Thoughts': Abelard and the Implications of Private Communication with God |journal=Church History |date=2000 |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=18–40 |jstor=3170578 |id={{ProQuest|217517814}} |doi=10.2307/3170578 |s2cid=163046747 }}</ref> He was one of the developers of the [[insanity defense]], writing in ''Scito te ipsum'', "Of this [sin], small children and of course insane people are untouched...lack[ing] reason....nothing is counted as sin for them".<ref>Turner, Wendy Joe. Madness in Medieval Law and Custom. 2010.</ref> He spearheaded the idea that mental illness was a natural condition and "debunked the idea that the devil caused insanity", a point of view which Thomas F. Graham argues Abelard was unable to separate himself from objectively to argue more subtly "because of his own mental health."<ref>Thomas F. Graham, Medieval Minds: Mental Health in the Middle Ages, 2019.</ref>

=== Law ===

Abelard stressed that subjective intention determines the moral value of human action and therefore that the legal consequence of an action is related to the person that commits it and not merely to the action. With this doctrine, Abelard created in the Middle Ages the idea of the individual subject central to modern law. This gave to School of Notre-Dame de Paris (later the University of Paris) a recognition for its expertise in the area of Law, even before the [[Faculty of Law of Paris|faculty of law]] existed and the school even recognized as an ''universitas'' and even though Abelard was a logician and a theologian.

=== Poetry and music ===
Abelard was also long known as an important poet and composer. He composed some celebrated love songs for Héloïse that are now lost, and which have not been identified in the anonymous repertoire. (One known romantic poem / possible lyric remains, "Dull is the Star".)<ref>"Dull is the Star", translated by Stanley Lombardo, in Levitan, William, Abelard and Heloise.</ref> Héloïse praised these songs in a letter: "The great charm and sweetness in language and music, and a soft attractiveness of the melody obliged even the unlettered".<ref name="grove">{{Cite Grove|last=Weinrich|first=Lorenz|title=Peter Abelard}}</ref> His education in music was based in his childhood learning of the traditional [[quadrivium]] studied at the time by almost all aspiring medieval scholars.

Abelard composed a hymnbook for the religious community that Héloïse joined. This hymnbook, written after 1130, differed from contemporary hymnals, such as that of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], in that Abelard used completely new and homogeneous material. The songs were grouped by metre, which meant that it was possible to use comparatively few melodies. Only one melody from this hymnal survives, ''O quanta qualia''.<ref name="grove" />

Abelard also wrote six biblical ''[[planctus]]'' ([[lament]]s):
* Planctus Dinae filiae Iacob; inc.: Abrahae proles Israel nata (Planctus I)
* Planctus Iacob super filios suos; inc.: Infelices filii, patri nati misero (Planctus II)
* Planctus virginum Israel super filia Jepte Galadite; inc.: Ad festas choreas celibes (Planctus III)
* Planctus Israel super Samson; inc.: Abissus vere multa (Planctus IV)
* Planctus David super Abner, filio Neronis, quem Ioab occidit; inc.: Abner fidelissime (Planctus V)
* Planctus David super Saul et Jonatha; inc.: Dolorum solatium (Planctus VI).

In surviving manuscripts, these pieces have been notated in diastematic [[neume]]s which resist reliable transcription. Only Planctus VI was fixed in square notation. Planctus as genre influenced the subsequent development of the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], a song form that flourished in northern Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries.

Melodies that have survived have been praised as "flexible, expressive melodies [that] show an elegance and technical adroitness that are very similar to the qualities that have been long admired in Abelard's poetry."<ref>{{cite web |last=Oliver |first=Michael |year=1995 |title=Review: a CD of Abelard's music |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/gramofilereview.asp?reviewID=9503094&mediaID=38977&issue=Reviewed%3A+Gramophone+3%2F1995 |url-access=registration |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209235712/http://www.gramophone.co.uk/gramofilereview.asp?reviewID=9503094&mediaID=38977&issue=Reviewed%3A+Gramophone+3%2F1995 |archive-date=9 December 2007 |access-date=7 December 2008 |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]}}</ref>

== Affair with Héloïse ==
[[File:Heloïse et d'Abélard.jpg|thumb|right|"Abaelardus and Heloïse surprised by Master Fulbert", by [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] painter [[Jean Vignaud]] (1819)]] [[Héloïse d'Argenteuil]] lived within the precincts of Notre-Dame, under the care of her uncle, the secular [[Canon (priest)|canon]] Fulbert. She was famous as the most well-educated and intelligent woman in Paris,<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=A letter from Peter the Venerable (1144) |url=https://epistolae.ctl.columbia.edu/letter/190.html |access-date=29 August 2023 |website=Epistolae |language=en}}</ref> renowned for her knowledge of [[classics|classical letters]], including not only [[Latin]] but also [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

At the time Heloise met Abelard, he was surrounded by crowds – supposedly thousands of students – drawn from all countries by the fame of his teaching. Enriched by the offerings of his pupils, and entertained with universal admiration, he came to think of himself as the only undefeated philosopher in the world. But a change in his fortunes was at hand. In his devotion to science, he claimed to have lived a very straight and narrow life, enlivened only by philosophical debate: now, at the height of his fame, he encountered romance.

Upon deciding to pursue Héloïse, Abelard sought a place in Fulbert's house, and by 1115 or 1116 began an affair. In Abelard's autobiography, he describes the relationship as a seduction, he used example phrases in his teaching such as "Peter loves his girl"; and he wrote popular poems and songs of his love that spread throughout the country. Heloise's letters depict a relationship of equals kindled by mutual attraction. Once Fulbert found out, he separated them, but they continued to meet in secret. Héloïse became pregnant and was sent by Abelard to be looked after by his family in Brittany, where she gave birth to a son, whom she named Astrolabe, after the [[astrolabe|scientific instrument]].<ref name=EB /><ref name="Calamitatum" />

=== Marriage ===
To appease Fulbert, Abelard proposed a marriage. Héloïse initially opposed marriage, but to appease her worries about Abelard's career prospects as a married philosopher, the couple were married in secret. (At this time, clerical celibacy was becoming the standard at higher levels in the church orders.)
To avoid suspicion of involvement with Abelard, Heloise continued to stay at her uncle's house. When Fulbert publicly disclosed the marriage, Héloïse vehemently denied it, arousing Fulbert's wrath and abuse. Abelard sent her to the convent at [[Argenteuil]], where she had been brought up, in an attempt to protect her from her uncle. Héloïse dressed as a nun and shared the nuns' life, though she was not consecrated.

=== Castration ===
[[File:Abelard castration.jpg|thumb|Abelard, attacked and castrated]]
Fulbert, infuriated that Heloise had been taken from his house and possibly believing that Abelard had disposed of her at Argenteuil in order to be rid of her, arranged for a band of men to break into Abelard's room one night and [[Castration|castrate]] him. In legal retribution for this vigilante attack, members of the band were punished, and Fulbert, scorned by the public, took temporary leave of his canon duties (he does not appear again in the Paris [[Cartulary|cartularies]] for several years).

=== Retirement into cloister ===
{{See also|Letters of Abelard and Heloise}}
In shame of his injuries, Abelard retired permanently as a Notre Dame canon, with any career as a priest or ambitions for higher office in the church shattered by his loss of manhood. He effectively hid himself as a monk at the monastery of St. Denis, near Paris, avoiding the questions of his horrified public. [[Roscellinus]] and Fulk of Deuil ridiculed and belittled Abelard for being castrated.<ref>Russell, Bertrand. ''The History of Western Philosophy''. Simon & Schuster, 1945, p. 436.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Internet History Sourcebooks: Medieval Sourcebook |url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/fulk-abelard.asp |access-date=29 August 2023 |website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref>

Upon joining the monastery at St. Denis, Abelard insisted that Héloïse take vows as a nun (she had few other options at the time).<ref>{{Cite web |title=British Library |url=https://www.bl.uk/the-middle-ages/articles/women-in-medieval-society#:~:text=Once%20widowed,%20such%20women%20had,veil'%20and%20become%20a%20nun |access-date=29 August 2023 |website=www.bl.uk}}</ref> Héloïse protested her separation from Abelard, sending numerous letters re-initiating their friendship and demanding answers to theological questions concerning her new vocation.<ref>Wheeler, Bonnie and Mary McLaughlin. The Letters of Heloise and Abelard. Palgrave. 2009.</ref>

=== Astrolabe, son of Abelard and Héloïse ===
Shortly after the birth of their child, Astrolabe, [[Héloïse]] and Abelard were both cloistered. Their son was thus brought up by Abelard's sister, Dionysia, at Abelard's childhood home in Le Pallet. His name derives from the [[astrolabe]], a Persian astronomical instrument said to elegantly model the universe<ref>Williams, Harold. The Universe in Your Hand: Teaching Astronomy Using an Astrolabe. 1994. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996ASPC...89..292W {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210214052626/http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996ASPC...89..292W |date=14 February 2021 }}</ref> and which was popularized in France by [[Adelard of Bath]]. He is mentioned in Abelard's poem to his son, the Carmen Astralabium, and by Abelard's protector, [[Peter the Venerable]] of [[Cluny]], who wrote to Héloise: "I will gladly do my best to obtain a [[prebendary|prebend]] in one of the great churches for your Astrolabe, who is also ours for your sake".

'Petrus Astralabius' is recorded at the [[Cathedral of Nantes]] in 1150, and the same name appears again later at the [[Hauterive Abbey|Cistercian abbey at Hauterive]] in what is now Switzerland. Given the extreme eccentricity of the name, it is almost certain that these references are to the same person. Astrolabe is recorded in the Paraclete necrology as dying on 29 or 30 October, year unknown, appearing as "Petrus Astralabius magistri nostri Petri filius" (son of our master Peter).<ref>Necrology of the Paraclete, in [[Enid McLeod]], ''Héloise'', London: Chatto & Windus, 2nd ed., 1971, pp. 253, 283–84</ref>

== Cloistered life ==

=== Abbey of Saint-Denis ===
In his early forties, Abelard sought to bury himself as a monk of the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] with his woes out of sight.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kevin Guilfoy|first=Jeffrey E. Brower|title=The Cambridge Companion To Abelard|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Abelard and monastic reform|isbn=978-0-521-77596-0|pages=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jaj-JMThB4MC&q=abelard+became+a+monk&pg=PA25|access-date=18 November 2020|archive-date=19 February 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230219062548/https://books.google.com/books?id=jaj-JMThB4MC&q=abelard+became+a+monk&pg=PA25|url-status=live}}</ref> Finding no respite in the [[cloister]], and having gradually turned again to study, he gave in to urgent entreaties, and reopened his school at an unknown priory owned by the monastery. His lectures, now framed in a devotional spirit, and with lectures on theology as well as his previous lectures on logic, were once again heard by crowds of students, and his old influence seemed to have returned. Using his studies of the Bible and, in his view, inconsistent writings of the leaders of the church as his basis, he wrote {{Lang|la|[[Sic et Non]]}} (''Yes and No'').<ref name=EB />

==== Heresy trial ====
No sooner had he published his theological lectures, the {{lang|la|Theologia Summi Boni}}, than his adversaries picked up on his rationalistic interpretation of the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] dogma. Two pupils of [[Anselm of Laon]], [[Alberich of Reims]] and Lotulf of Lombardy, instigated proceedings against Abelard, charging him with [[Sabellianism]] in a [[1121 Council of Soissons|provincial synod held at Soissons in 1121]]. Through irregular procedures, they obtained an official condemnation of his teaching, and Abelard was made to burn a copy of the {{lang|la|Theologia}} himself. He was then sentenced to perpetual confinement in a monastery other than his own, but it seems to have been agreed in advance that this sentence would be revoked almost immediately because, after a few days in the convent of St. Medard at Soissons, Abelard returned to St. Denis.<ref name=Marenbon-15 />

==== Events leading to change of monastery ====
Life in his own monastery proved no more congenial than before. For this Abelard himself was partly responsible. Since at least the ninth century, the legends of [[Dionysius the Areopagite]] and Denis of Paris had often been conflated, largely due to [[Hilduin of Saint-Denis|Hilduin]], Abbot of Saint-Denis, eager to promote the dignity of the abbey.<ref>A. Hamilton Thompson, reviewing [[Sumner McKnight Crosby]], ''The Abbey of Saint-Denis, 475–1122''. Vol. I, in ''The English Historical Review'' '''58''' No. 231 (July 1943:357–359) p 358.</ref> The monastic community at [[Abbey of Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] took pride in this supposed connection. Abelard teasingly pointed out a possibility that the founder of the Abbey could have been another Dionysius, who is mentioned as Dionysius of Corinth by [[Eusebius]]. This irritated the monks so much that eventually Abelard was allowed to leave. 

=== Oratory of the Paraclete ===
{{close paraphrasing|source="EB1911"|free=yes|date=February 2023}}
Abelard initially lodged at St. Ayoul of Provins, where the prior was a friend. Then, after the death of Abbot Adam in March 1122, Abelard was able to gain permission from the new abbot, [[Abbot Suger|Suger]], to live "in whatever solitary place he wished". In a deserted place near [[Nogent-sur-Seine]] in [[Champagne (historical province)|Champagne]], he built a cabin of stubble and reeds, created a simple oratory dedicated to the Trinity, and became a [[hermit]]. When his retreat became known, students flocked from Paris, and covered the wilderness around him with their tents and huts. He began to teach again there. The [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] was rebuilt in wood and stone and rededicated as the [[Oratory of the Paraclete]].<ref name="EB1911">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Abelard, Peter |first1=Peter George |last1=Croom |last2=Shotwell |first2=James  Thomson |page=41}}</ref>

==== Events leading to change of monastery ====
Abelard remained at the Paraclete for about five years. His combination of the teaching of secular arts with his profession as a monk was heavily criticized by other men of religion, and Abelard contemplated flight outside Christendom altogether.<ref name="Luscombe">{{cite web |author=David Edward Luscombe |title=Peter Abelard |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1041/Peter-Abelard |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174804/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1041/Peter-Abelard |archive-date=2 May 2015 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}</ref> Abelard therefore decided to leave and find another refuge, accepting sometime between 1126 and 1128 an invitation to preside over the Abbey of [[Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys]] on the far-off shore of Lower Brittany.<ref name="EB1911" />

=== Abbey of Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys ===

The region was inhospitable, the domain a prey to outlaws, the house itself savage and disorderly.<ref name="EB1911" /> There, too, his relations with the community deteriorated.<ref name="Luscombe" />

==== Lectures ====
[[File:France illustrée I p473.png|thumb|Abelard receives Héloïse at the monastery of the [[Paraclete]]  (1129)]]

Lack of success at St. Gildas made Abelard decide to take up public teaching again (although he remained for a few more years, officially, Abbot of St. Gildas). It is not entirely certain what he then did, but given that [[John of Salisbury]] heard Abelard lecture on dialectic in 1136, it is presumed that he returned to Paris and resumed teaching on the [[Montagne Sainte-Geneviève]]. His lectures were dominated by logic, at least until 1136, when he produced further drafts of his ''Theologia'' in which he analyzed the sources of belief in the Trinity and praised the pagan philosophers of classical antiquity for their virtues and for their discovery by the use of [[reason]] of many fundamental aspects of Christian revelation.<ref name="Luscombe" />

==== Late writings ====
{{See also|Letters of Abelard and Heloise}}
In 1128, Abbot Suger claimed that the convent at Argenteuil, where Héloïse was prioress, belonged to his abbey of St Denis. In 1129 he gained possession and he made no provision for the nuns. When Abelard heard, he transferred Paraclete and its lands to Héloïse and her remaining nuns, making her abbess.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/pking/miscellaneous/Abelard.DLB.pdf|first=Peter|last=King|page=13|title=Peter Abelard|encyclopedia=The Dictionary of Literary Biography|volume=115|year=1992|access-date=21 July 2006|archive-date=9 January 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109025209/http://individual.utoronto.ca/pking/miscellaneous/Abelard.DLB.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> He provided the new community with a rule and with a justification of the nun's way of life; in this he emphasized the virtue of literary study. He also provided books of hymns he had composed, and in the early 1130s he and Héloïse composed a collection of their own love letters and religious correspondence<ref name="Luscombe" /> containing, amongst other notable pieces, Abelard's most famous letter containing his autobiography, ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'' (''The History of My Calamities''). This moved Héloïse to write her first Letter;<ref>{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Bonnie|title=Listening to Héloïse: the voice of a twelfth-century woman|year=2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-21354-1|pages=150–151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f4ETQPKFVwoC&q=H%C3%A9lo%C3%AFse+first+letter+passion&pg=PA150|access-date=18 November 2020|archive-date=19 February 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230219062548/https://books.google.com/books?id=f4ETQPKFVwoC&q=H%C3%A9lo%C3%AFse+first+letter+passion&pg=PA150|url-status=live}}</ref> the first being followed by the two other Letters, in which she finally accepted the part of resignation, which, now as a brother to a sister, Abelard commended to her. Sometime before 1140, Abelard published his masterpiece, ''Ethica'' or ''[[Scito te ipsum]]'' (Know Thyself), where he analyzes the idea of sin and that actions are not what a man will be judged for but intentions.<ref name="EB" /> During this period, he also wrote ''[[Dialogus inter Philosophum, Judaeum et Christianum]]'' (Dialogue between a Philosopher, a Jew, and a Christian), and also ''[[Expositio in Epistolam ad Romanos]]'', a commentary on [[St. Paul]]'s epistle to the Romans, where he expands on the meaning of Christ's life.<ref name="EB" />

== Conflicts with Bernard of Clairvaux ==
It is not clear whether Abelard stopped teaching after 1136, or whether he continued with all except his lectures on logic until as late as 1141. Whatever the exact timing, a process was instigated by [[William of St-Thierry]], who discovered what he considered to be heresies in some of Abelard's teaching. In spring 1140 he wrote to the [[Bishop of Chartres]] and to [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], denouncing them. Another, less distinguished, theologian, [[Thomas of Morigny]], also produced at the same time a list of Abelard's supposed heresies, perhaps at Bernard's instigation. Bernard's complaint mainly was that Abelard had applied logic where it is not applicable, and that is illogical.<ref>{{cite book |author=John R. Sommerfeldt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lj_CNqojMV8C |title=Bernard of Clairvaux on the Life of the Mind |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8091-4203-3 |page=134}}</ref>

Amid pressure from Bernard, Abelard challenged Bernard either to withdraw his accusations, or to make them publicly at the important [[Councils of Sens|church council at Sens]] planned for 2 June 1141. In so doing, Abelard put himself into the position of the wronged party and forced Bernard to defend himself from the accusation of slander. Bernard avoided this trap, however: on the eve of the council, he called a private meeting of the assembled bishops and persuaded them to condemn, one by one, each of the heretical propositions he attributed to Abelard. When Abelard appeared at the council the next day, he was presented with a list of condemned propositions imputed to him.<ref name="John Marenbon 2004 p17">{{harvnb|Marenbon|2004|p=17}}.</ref>

Unable to answer to these propositions, Abelard left the assembly, appealed to the Pope, and set off for Rome, hoping that the Pope would be more supportive. However, this hope was unfounded. On 16 July 1141, [[Pope Innocent II]] issued a bull [[excommunication|excommunicating]] Abelard and his followers and imposing perpetual silence on him, and in a second document, he ordered Abelard to be confined in a monastery and his books to be burned. Abelard was saved from this sentence, however, by Peter the Venerable, abbot of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]]. Abelard had stopped there, on his way to Rome, before the papal condemnation had reached France. Peter persuaded Abelard, already old, to give up his journey and stay at the monastery. Peter managed to arrange a reconciliation with Bernard, to have the sentence of excommunication lifted, and to persuade Innocent that it was enough if Abelard remained under the aegis of Cluny.

== Health issues ==
Abelard suffered at least two nervous collapses, the first around 1104–5, cited as due to the stresses of too much study. In his words: "Not long afterward, though, my health broke down under the strain of too much study and I had to return home to Brittany. I was away from France for several years, bitterly missed..."<ref>Levitan, William. ''Abelard and Heloise: The Letters and Other Writings''. 2007. p. 3</ref> His second documented collapse took place in 1141 at the Council of Sens, where he was accused of heresy and was unable to speak in reply. In the words of Geoffrey of Auxerre: his "memory became very confused, his reason blacked out and his interior sense forsook him."<ref>Geoffrey of Auxerres. Qtd in: Clanchy, MT. A Medieval Life, 1999.</ref><ref>Geoffrey of Auxerres. Qtd in: Burge, James. ''Heloise and Abelard: A New Biography'', 2003.</ref>

== Death ==
Abelard spent his final months at the priory of St. Marcel, near [[Chalon-sur-Saône]], before he died on 21 April 1142.<ref name="John Marenbon 2004 p17" /> He is said to have uttered the last words "I don't know", before expiring.<ref>{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Norman|author-link=Norman Davies|title=Europe: A history|page=[https://archive.org/details/europehistory00davi_0/page/687 687]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-19-820171-7|url=https://archive.org/details/europehistory00davi_0|url-access=registration |access-date=7 December 2008}}</ref> He died from a fever while suffering from a skin disorder, possibly [[mange]] or [[scurvy]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Norman and Betty|last=Donaldson|title=How Did They Die?|year=1980|publisher=Greenwich House|isbn=978-0-517-40302-0}}</ref> Heloise and Peter of Cluny arranged with the Pope, after Abelard's death, to clear his name of heresy charges.[[File:Abelardtomb closeup.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dedicatory panel in the Père Lachaise Cemetery]]
Abelard was first buried at St. Marcel, but his remains were soon carried off secretly to the Paraclete, and given over to the loving care of Héloïse, who in time came herself to rest beside them in 1163.

The bones of the pair were moved more than once afterwards, but they were preserved even through the vicissitudes of the [[French Revolution]], and now are presumed to lie in the well-known tomb in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in eastern Paris.<ref>{{harvnb|Burge|2006|p=276}}.</ref> The transfer of their remains there in 1817 is considered to have considerably contributed to the popularity of that cemetery, at the time still far outside the built-up area of Paris. By tradition, lovers or lovelorn singles leave letters at the crypt, in tribute to the couple or in hope of finding true love.

This second burial remains disputed. The [[Oratory of the Paraclete]] claims Abelard and Héloïse are buried there and that what exists in Père-Lachaise is merely a monument, or [[cenotaph]]. According to Père-Lachaise, the remains of both lovers were transferred from the Oratory in the early 19th century and reburied in the famous crypt on their grounds.<ref>{{harvnb|Burge|2006|pp=276–277}}.</ref> Others believe that while Abelard is buried in the tomb at Père-Lachaise, Heloïse's remains are elsewhere.

== Influence on later theology ==
Novelist and Abelard scholar George Moore referred to Abelard as the "first [[protestant]]" prior to [[Martin Luther]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Heloise and Abelard: the more the story is retold, the deeper their grave in Paris grows |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/heloise-and-abelard-the-more-the-story-is-retold-the-deeper-their-grave-in-paris-grows-1.3855724 |access-date=29 August 2023 |newspaper=The Irish Times |language=en}}</ref> While Abelard conflicted with the Church to the point of (later cleared) heresy charges, he never denied his Catholic faith.

=== Comments from Pope Benedict XVI ===
During his general audience on 4 November 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] talked about [[Saint]] [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and Peter Abelard to illustrate differences in the [[monastic]] and [[scholasticism|scholastic]] approaches to theology in the 12th century. The Pope recalled that theology is the search for a rational understanding (if possible) of the mysteries of Christian [[revelation]], which is believed through [[faith]] — faith that seeks intelligibility (''fides quaerens intellectum''). But St. Bernard, a representative of monastic theology, emphasized "faith" whereas Abelard, who is a scholastic, stressed "understanding through reason".<ref name="NCR">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/st._bernard_and_peter_abelard |title=St. Bernard and Peter Abelard |publisher=National Catholic Register – [[EWTN News, Inc.]] |date=13 November 2009 |access-date=21 June 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619153341/http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/st._bernard_and_peter_abelard |archive-date=19 June 2015 }}</ref>

For Bernard of Clairvaux, faith is based on the testimony of [[Scripture]] and on the teaching of the [[Fathers of the Church]]. Thus, Bernard found it difficult to agree with Abelard and, in a more general way, with those who would subject the truths of faith to the critical examination of reason — an examination which, in his opinion, posed a grave danger: [[intellectualism]], the relativizing of truth, and the questioning of the truths of faith themselves. Theology for Bernard could be nourished only in [[contemplative prayer]], by the affective union of the heart and mind with God, with only one purpose: to promote the living, intimate experience of God; an aid to loving God ever more and ever better.<ref name="NCR" />

According to Pope Benedict XVI, an excessive use of philosophy rendered Abelard's [[doctrine]] of the [[Trinity]] fragile and, thus, his idea of God. In the field of morals, his teaching was vague, as he insisted on considering the intention of the subject as the only basis for describing the goodness or evil of moral acts, thereby ignoring the objective meaning and moral value of the acts, resulting in a dangerous [[subjectivism]]. But the Pope recognized the great achievements of Abelard, who made a decisive contribution to the development of scholastic theology, which eventually expressed itself in a more mature and fruitful way during the following century. And some of Abelard's insights should not be underestimated, for example, his affirmation that non-Christian religious traditions already contain some form of preparation for welcoming Christ.<ref name="NCR" />

Pope Benedict XVI concluded that Bernard's "theology of the heart" and Abelard's "theology of reason" represent the importance of healthy theological discussion and [[Humility|humble]] obedience to the authority of the Church, especially when the questions being debated have not been defined by the [[magisterium]]. Both St. Bernard and Abelard always recognized without any hesitation the authority of the magisterium. Abelard showed [[humility]] in acknowledging his errors, and Bernard exercised great [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]]. The Pope emphasized that a balance should exist between divine principles in the field of theology—which principles are given through Revelation and which always maintain their primary importance—and the interpretative principles proposed by philosophy (that is, by reason)—which have an important function, but only as a tool. When the balance breaks down, theological reflection runs the risk of becoming marred by error; it is then up to the magisterium to exercise the needed service to truth, for which it is responsible.<ref name="NCR" />
