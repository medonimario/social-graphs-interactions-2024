Cornforth died aged 71 in [[Islington]],<ref name="c20phil" /> London, in 1980, leaving a widow, Kathleen Elliott, his second wife.<ref name="TimesObit" />

==Philosophy==
When Cornforth began his career in philosophy in the early 1930s, he was a follower of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], writing in the then current style of [[analytic philosophy]]. Cornforth later became a leading ideologist of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. He was critical of the aesthetic theories of fellow Marxist [[Christopher Caudwell]].

''In Defense of Philosophy'' attacks [[empiricist]] philosophies of many kinds, such as those of [[Rudolf Carnap]] ([[linguistic analysis]]) and [[William James]] ([[pragmatism]]), on the [[dialectical materialism|materialist]] grounds that they divorce science and scientific investigation from the search for truer understanding of the really existing universe.{{clarify|date=October 2013}} In this book there is a combination of Marxism with deep insights into the interrelations of the various sciences and the philosophical conundrums produced by the empiricist attempt to reduce science to the collection and correlation of data. Both the insights are based on the theory of the primacy of physical work and tools (thus, "materialism") in the development of specifically human traits such as [[language]], abstract thought, and [[social organisation]], and the essential role of the external world in the increasingly complex development of forms of life.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Cornforth's multi-volume book ''Dialectical Materialism'' was originally published in 1953 by the International Publishers, Co., Inc. The first US edition of this work was printed in 1971. The text originated from lectures that Cornforth received funding for from the London District Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1950.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The first volume, ''Materialism and the Dialectical Method'', provides a good introduction to several important sociological principles: [[idealism]], [[metaphysics]], [[materialism]], mechanical materialism, and [[dialectical materialism]], in addition to Marxist philosophy. Volume 2 of this text is entitled ''Historical Materialism'', and Volume 3 is ''Theory of Knowledge''.
