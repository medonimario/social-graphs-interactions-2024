'''Julius Caesar Scaliger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|æ|l|ɪ|dʒ|ər}}; 23 April 1484 – 21 October 1558), or '''Giulio Cesare della Scala''', was an Italian scholar and physician, who spent a major part of his career in France. He employed the techniques and discoveries of [[Renaissance humanism]] to defend [[Aristotelianism]] against the [[New Learning]]. In spite of his contentious disposition, his contemporary reputation was high. [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]] claimed that none of the ancients could be placed above him and that he had no equal in his own time.{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|p=283}}

==Biography==
Scaliger's father, Benedetto Bordone, was a [[Portrait miniature|miniaturist]] and [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminator]].<ref>Richard S. Westfall, [http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/scaliger.html Galileo Project biography].</ref> Scaliger himself was known in his youth by the family name Bordone, but later insisted that he was a scion of the house of [[Scaliger|La Scala]], for a hundred and fifty years lords of [[Verona]].{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|p=283}} He was born in [[Padua]] on 23 August 1484,<ref>Richard S. Westfall, [http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/scaliger.html Galileo Project biography]</ref> though his son later claimed that he was born at the [[Riva del Garda|Rocca di Riva]], on [[Lake Garda]].

There are two accounts of his life, his own and that of his critics.

===His own account===
When he was twelve, his kinsman the emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]] placed him among his pages. He remained for seventeen years in the service of the emperor, distinguishing himself as a soldier and as a captain. He also studied art under [[Albrecht Dürer]].{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|p=283}}

In 1512 at the [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]], where his father and elder brother were killed, his conduct earned him [[Order of the Golden Spur]], augmented with the collar and the eagle of gold.{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|p=283}}

He left the service of Maximilian, and after a brief employment by another kinsman, the [[duke of Ferrara]], he decided to quit the military life, and in 1514 entered as a student at the [[University of Bologna]]. He decided to take [[holy orders]], expecting that he would become [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and then [[pope]], when he would wrest from the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] his duchy of Verona, which the republic had taken from his ancestors. He soon gave up this plan, but remained at the university until 1519.{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|p=283}}

The next six years he passed at the castle of [[Vico Nuovo]], in [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], as a guest of the [[Della Rovere]], at first dividing his time between military expeditions in the summer, and study, chiefly of [[medicine]] and [[natural history]], in the winter, until a severe attack of [[rheumatic]] [[gout]] brought his military career to a close. Henceforth his life was wholly devoted to study. In 1525 he accompanied [[Antonio della Rovera]], [[bishop of Agen]], to that city as his physician.{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|p=283}}

===Later account===
It was not until some time after his death that the enemies of his son first alleged that he was not of the family of La Scala, but was the son of [[Benedetto Bordone]], an illuminator or schoolmaster of Verona; that he was educated at [[Padua]], where he took the degree of [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]; and that the story of his life before arriving at Agen was pure invention. It is supported by no other evidence than his own statements, some of which are inconsistent with well-ascertained facts.{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|p=283}}

===Life at Agen===
The remaining thirty-two years of his life were passed almost wholly at [[Agen]]. On his death in 1558 he had a high scientific and literary reputation, though his books gave rise to disputes. He was charged with [[heresy]] in 1538 but was acquitted, one of the judges being his friend [[Arnoul Le Ferron]].{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|p=283}}

==Works==
In 1531 he printed his first oration against [[Erasmus]], in defence of [[Cicero]] and the [[Ciceronians]] (''Oratio pro Cicerone contra Erasmum'', Paris 1531), dismissing Erasmus as a literary parasite, a mere corrector of texts.{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|p=283}} It is notable for its vigorous invective and, like his subsequent writings, its excellent [[Latin language|Latin]]. It has been said of it, however, that it misses the point of his opponent's treatise ''[[Ciceronianus]]''. Erasmus did not reply, thinking it was the work of a personal enemy, Meander. Scaliger then wrote a second oration (published in 1536), also full of invective. The orations were followed by a large amount of Latin verse, which appeared in successive volumes in 1533, 1534, 1539, 1546 and 1547. This verse appeared in numerous editions, but was less appreciated by later critics. (One of them, [[Mark Pattison (academic)|Mark Pattison]], agreed with the judgment of [[Pierre Daniel Huet]], who said: "par ses poésies brutes et informes Scaliger a déshonoré le Parnasse".) He also published a brief tract on comic metres (''De comicis dimensionibus'') and a work ''De causis linguae Latinae'' (Lyons 1540; Geneva 1580; Frankfurt 1623), in which he analyzes the style of Cicero and indicates 634 mistakes of [[Lorenzo Valla]] and his humanist predecessors, claimed to be the earliest Latin [[grammar]] using scientific principles and method. He published no other purely literary works in his lifetime.

His ''Poetices libri septem'' ("Seven books on Poetics", Lyons 1561; Leyden 1581) appeared after his death. They contained many paradoxes and some elements of personal animosity (especially in his reference to [[Étienne Dolet]]), but also contain acute criticism based on the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' of Aristotle, "imperator noster; omnium bonarum artium dictator perpetuus" ("our Emperor, dictator forever of all good qualities in the arts"), an influential treatise in the history of [[literary criticism]]. Like many of his generation Scaliger prized [[Virgil]] above [[Homer]]. His praise of the tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] over those of the Greeks influenced both [[Shakespeare]] and [[Pierre Corneille]].

Scaliger intended to be judged primarily as a philosopher and a man of science and regarded classical studies as a means of relaxation. He was noted for his powers of observation and his tenacious memory. His scientific writings are all in the form of commentaries. It was not until he was seventy that (with the exception of a brief tract on the ''De insomniis'' of [[Hippocrates]]) he felt that any of them were ready for publication. In 1556 he printed his ''Dialogue'' on the ''[[De plantis]]'' attributed to [[Aristotle]], and in 1557 his ''Exotericarum exercitationum'' ("Exoteric Exercises", or simply ''Exercitationes'') on [[Gerolamo Cardano]]'s ''De Subtilitate''. His other scientific works, commentaries on [[Theophrastus]]' ''De causis plantarum'' and Aristotle's ''History of Animals'', he left in a more or less unfinished state, and they were not printed until after his death.{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|p=283}}

His work shows no sign of the [[inductive reasoning]] attributed to the [[scientific method]]. Unlike his contemporary [[Konrad von Gesner]], he was not led by his botanical studies to a natural system of classification. He rejected the discoveries of [[Copernicus]]. He was guided by Aristotle in [[metaphysics]] and in [[natural history]] and by [[Galen]] in medicine, but did not follow them uncritically.{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|pp=283–284}}

He is best known for his critical ''Exotericarum Exercitationes'' on Cardan's ''De Subtilitate'' (1557), a book approaching [[natural philosophy]] and which had a long popularity.<ref>Julii Caesaris Scaligeri ''Exotericarum exercitationum'' liber XV. ''De Subtilitate'' ad Hieronymum Cardanum. Francofurti. Apud Claudium Marnium, & haeredes Ioannes Aubrii. M.&nbsp;DC.&nbsp;VII. [=&nbsp;1607] ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Le8TAAAAQAAJ& online version]).</ref> The ''Exercitationes'' display encyclopaedic knowledge and accurate observation; but, as noted by [[Gabriel Naudé]], they are not flawless. They had an influence upon [[Natural history|natural historians]], philosophers and scientists such as [[Justus Lipsius|Lipsius]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].<ref>Herman H.J. Lynge & Sons, International Antiquarian Booksellers [https://archive.today/20130128042912/http://www.lynge.com/item.php?bookid=31639 "Renaissance Enlightenment – Defending Aristotle Against Cardano"]</ref> [[Charles Nisard]] wrote that Scaliger's object seems to be to deny all that Cardan affirms and to affirm all that Cardan denies. Yet [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[William Hamilton (metaphysician)|Sir William Hamilton]] recognize him as the best modern exponent of the physics and metaphysics of Aristotle.{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|p=284}}

==Family==
A few days after his arrival at Agen he fell in love with an orphan of thirteen, Andiette de Roques Lobejac;{{sfn|Christie|Sandys|1911|p=283}} she was a distant relative of the aristocratic house of Rochepozay (also Roche-Pozay or Roche-Posay),<ref>The Roman Stamp: Frame and Facade in Some Forms of Neo-Classicism, Robert M.
