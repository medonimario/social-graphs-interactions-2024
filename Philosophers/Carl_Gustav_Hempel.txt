'''Carl Gustav''' "'''Peter'''" '''Hempel''' (January 8, 1905&nbsp;– November 9, 1997) was a [[Germans|German]] [[writer]], [[philosopher]], logician, and [[epistemologist]]. He was a major figure in [[Logical positivism|logical empiricism]], a 20th-century movement in the [[philosophy of science]]. Hempel articulated the [[deductive-nomological model]] of [[science|scientific]] [[explanation]], which was considered the "standard model" of scientific explanation during the 1950s and 1960s. He is also known for the [[raven paradox]] ("Hempel's paradox")<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fetzer |first=James |url= |title=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=17 December 2021 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |chapter=Carl Hempel |chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2022/entries/hempel/ |via= |accessdate=17 December 2021}}</ref> and [[Hempel's dilemma]].

==Education==
Hempel studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[Georg August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] and subsequently at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and the [[Heidelberg University]]. In [[Göttingen]], he encountered [[David Hilbert]] and was impressed by [[Hilbert's program|his program]] attempting to base all [[mathematics]] on solid [[logic]]al foundations derived from a limited number of [[axiom]]s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Murzi |first=Mauro |year=2001 |title=Hempel, Carl |url=https://iep.utm.edu/hempel/ |access-date=2024-10-08 |website=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |at=Life |language=en-US}}</ref>

After moving to [[Berlin]], Hempel participated in a congress on scientific philosophy in 1929 where he met [[Rudolf Carnap]] and became involved in the [[Berlin Circle]] of philosophers associated with the [[Vienna Circle]]. In 1934, he received his [[doctoral degree]] from the [[University of Berlin]] with a dissertation on [[probability theory]], titled ''Beiträge zur logischen Analyse des Wahrscheinlichkeitsbegriffs'' (''Contributions to the Logical Analysis of the Concept of Probability''). [[Hans Reichenbach]] was Hempel's main doctoral supervisor, but after Reichenbach lost his philosophy chair in Berlin in 1933, [[Wolfgang Köhler]] and [[Nicolai Hartmann]] became the official supervisors.<ref name="Hempel_2">{{cite book | last=Hempel | first=Carl G. | editor-last=Jeffrey | editor-first=Richard | title=Selected Philosophical Essays | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=13 January 2000 | isbn=978-0-521-62475-6 | doi=10.1017/cbo9780511815157 | page=viii}}</ref>

==Career==
Within a year of completing his doctorate, the increasingly repressive and [[Anti-Semitism|anti-semitic]] [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime in Germany]] had prompted Hempel to emigrate to Belgium as his wife was of Jewish ancestry.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bailey |first=Andrew |url= |title=First Philosophy: Fundamental Problems and Readings in Philosophy |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-55111-360-9 |pages=313 |language=en |chapter=Who was Carl Hempel? |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USllKPe2z24C&pg=PA311}}</ref> In this he was aided by the scientist [[Paul Oppenheim]], with whom he co-authored the book ''Der Typusbegriff im Lichte der neuen Logik'' on [[Linguistic typology|typology]] and logic in 1936.<ref name=":0" /> In 1937, Hempel emigrated to the United States, where he accepted a position as Carnap's assistant<ref>{{cite web |last=Hempel |first=Carl |title=Carl Gustav Hempel's Papers |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead&cc=ascead&rgn=main&view=text&didno=US-PPiU-asp199901 |publisher=Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh |access-date=2013-09-17}}</ref> at the [[University of Chicago]]. He later held positions at the [[City College of New York]] (1939–1948), [[Yale University]] (1948–1955) and [[Princeton University]], where he taught alongside [[Thomas Kuhn]] and remained until made [[emeritus]] in 1973. Between 1974 and 1976, he was an emeritus at the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem before becoming University Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1977 and teaching there until 1985. In 1989 the Department of Philosophy at Princeton University renamed its Three Lecture Series the 'Carl G. Hempel Lectures' in his honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philosophy.princeton.edu/about/great-and-good/carl-g-hempel|title=Carl G.

==Philosophical views==
Hempel never embraced the term "[[logical positivism]]" as an accurate description of the Vienna Circle and Berlin Group, preferring to describe those philosophers, including himself, as "logical empiricists." He believed that the term "[[positivism]]," with its roots in the [[materialism]] of [[Auguste Comte]], implied a [[metaphysics]] that empiricists were not obliged to embrace. He regarded [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] as a philosopher with a genius for stating philosophical insights in striking and memorable language, but believed that he, or at least the Wittgenstein of the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]],'' made claims that could only be supported by recourse to [[metaphysics]]. To Hempel, metaphysics involved claims to know things which were not knowable; that is, metaphysical hypotheses were incapable of confirmation or disconfirmation by evidence.

In his exploration of the [[philosophy of science]], Hempel brought to light the significant contributions of 19th-century [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[physician]] [[Ignaz Semmelweis]]. His examination of Semmelweis's systematic discovery in addressing a scientific problem provided a historical context for Hempel's own reflections. This account of Semmelweis's work notably influenced Hempel's thoughts on the role of '[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]' in scientific inquiry. He considered Semmelweis's approach as a pivotal example of how [[empirical evidence]] and inductive reasoning play a crucial role in the development of scientific knowledge, further enriching his perspective on [[Logical positivism|logical empiricism]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Raza |first=Syed Ahsan |date=2017 |title=Theory of scientific investigation by Hempel and a case of Semmelweis |journal=Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=198–200 |doi=10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_61_17 |issn=2249-4863 |pmc=5749055 |pmid=29302516 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Hempel is also credited with the revival of the [[Deductive-nomological model]] of explanation in the 1940s with the publication of "The function of general laws in history".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hempel | first1 = Carl G | last2 = Oppenheim | first2 = Paul | date = Apr 1948 | title = Studies in the logic of explanation | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 135–175 | jstor = 185169 | doi = 10.1086/286983 | s2cid = 16924146 }}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 2005, the [[Oranienburg|City of Oranienburg]], Hempel's birthplace, renamed one of its streets "Carl-Gustav-Hempel-Straße" in his memory.
