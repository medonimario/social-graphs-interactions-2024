== Views ==

=== Bioethics ===
Ramsey aligned himself with [[Deontologic ethics|deontologial normative theories]], rather than the [[Roman catholic|Roman Catholic]] teachings of relative autonomy of [[natural law]] and [[morality]].<ref name=":1" /> He has addressed the concepts of [[abortion]], [[health care]], [[organ donation]], [[informed consent]], and fetal experimentation.

In 1972 Ramsey wrote an article for the Journal of the American Medical Association in which he strongly opposed in vitro fertilization, declaring that it "constitutes unethical medical experimentation on possible future human beings, and therefore, it is subject to absolute moral prohibition."<ref name=":0" />
