'''Giovanni Papini''' (9 January 1881{{spaced ndash}}8 July 1956) was an Italian journalist, essayist, novelist, short story writer, poet, literary critic, and [[Italian philosophy|philosopher]]. A controversial literary figure of the early and mid-twentieth century, he was the earliest and most enthusiastic representative and promoter of Italian [[pragmatism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lachs|first1=John|last2=B. Talisse|first2=Robert|title= American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia|pages=562|year=2008}}</ref> Papini was admired for his writing style and engaged in heated [[polemic]]s. Involved with [[avant-garde]] movements such as [[futurism]] and [[Decadent movement|post-decadentism]], he moved from one political and philosophical position to another, always dissatisfied and uneasy: he converted from [[anti-clericalism]] and [[atheism]] to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], and went from convinced [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionism]] &ndash; before 1915 &ndash; to an aversion to war. In the 1930s, after moving from [[individualism]] to [[conservatism]], he finally became a [[fascism|fascist]], while maintaining an aversion to [[Nazism]].

As one of the founders of the journals ''[[Leonardo (Italian magazine)|Leonardo]]'' (1903) and ''[[Lacerba]]'' (1913), he conceived literature as "action" and gave his writings an oratory and irreverent tone. Though self-educated, he was an influential iconoclastic editor and writer, with a leading role in [[Futurism#Italian Futurism|Italian futurism]] and the early literary movements of youth. Working in Florence, he actively participated in foreign literary philosophical and political movements such as the French [[intuitionism]] of [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] and the [[Anglo-America]]n [[pragmatism]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[William James|James]]. Promoting the development of Italian culture and life with an individualistic and dreamy conception of life and art, he acted as a spokesman for [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religious beliefs.

Papini's literary success began with ''[[Il crepuscolo dei filosofi]]'' ("The Twilight of the Philosophers"), published in 1906, and his 1913 publication of his autobiographical novel ''[[A Man — Finished|Un uomo finito]]'' ("A finished man").

Due to his ideological choices, Papini's work was almost forgotten after his death,<ref>[https://www.vieusseux.it/uploads/antologia/ITALIA-LETTERATURA-ITALIANA_DEF_Antologia57_imp.pdf LETTERATURA ITALIANA a cura di Paola Italia GIOVANNI PAPINI-GIUSEPPE PREZZOLINI]</ref> although it was later re-evaluated and appreciated again: in 1975, the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] called him an "undeservedly forgotten" author.

==Early life==
[[File:Via ghibellina 115, casa 01.JPG|thumb|Giovanni Papini's house in Florence]]
Born in [[Florence]] as the son of a modest furniture retailer (and former member of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s [[redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]]) from [[:it:Borgo degli Albizi|Borgo degli Albizi]], Papini was [[baptism|baptized]] in secret by his mother to avoid the [[antireligion|aggressive anti-clericalism]] of his father. Almost entirely self-educated, he never received an official university degree, and his highest level of education was a teaching certificate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Marrone|first1=Gaetana|last2=Puppa|first2=Paolo|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies|pages=1347|year=2006}}</ref> Papini had a rustic, lonesome childhood. He felt a strong aversion to all beliefs, to all [[Religion|churches]], as well as to any form of servitude (which he saw as connected to [[religion]]); he became enchanted with the idea of writing an [[encyclopedia]] wherein all cultures would be summarized.

Trained at the ''Istituto di Studi Superiori'' (1900–2), he taught for a year in the Anglo-Italian school and then was a librarian at the Museum of Anthropology from 1902 to 1904.<ref>Hoehn, Matthew (1948).

In: ''Living Authors: A Book of Biographies''. New York: The H.W. Wilson company, p. 314.</ref> Through Leonardo's Papini and his contributors introduced in Italy important thinkers such as [[Kierkegaard]], Peirce, Nietzsche, [[George Santayana|Santayana]] and Poincaré. He would later join the staff of ''Il Regno'',<ref>Bondanella, Peter, ed. (2001).

Papini met [[William James]] and [[Henri Bergson]], who greatly influenced his early works.<ref>Orlandi, Daniela (2007). "Papini (1881–1856)." In: ''Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies'', Paolo Puppa & Luca Somigli (eds.), Vol. I. Taylor & Francis, p. 1347.</ref> He started publishing short stories and essays: in 1906, "''Il Tragico Quotidiano''" ("Everyday Tragic"), in 1907 "''Il Pilota Cieco''" ("The Blind Pilot") and ''[[Il crepuscolo dei filosofi]]'' ("The Twilight of the Philosophers"). The latter constituted a [[polemic]] with established and diverse intellectual figures, such as [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Auguste Comte]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

Papini proclaimed the death of philosophy and the demolition of thinking itself. He briefly flirted with [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]]<ref>Collins, Joseph (1920).

In 1907 Papini married Giacinta Giovagnoli; the couple had two daughters.<ref>Orlandi, Daniela (2007), p. 1347.</ref>

==Before and during World War I==
[[File:Caricature of Giovanni Papini.jpg|thumbnail|right|"Caricature of Papini", by [[Carlo Carrà]] & [[Ardengo Soffici]], from ''Broom'', 1922.]]
After leaving ''Il Leonardo'' in 1907, Giovanni Papini founded several other magazines. First, he published ''La Voce'' in 1908, then ''L'Anima'' together with [[Giovanni Amendola]] and Prezzolini. In 1913 (right before Italy's entry into [[World War I]]) he started ''Lacerba'' (1913–15). For three years Papini was a correspondent for the ''Mercure de France'' and later literary critic for ''La Nazione''.<ref>Hoehn, Matthew (1948), p. 607.</ref> About 1918 he created yet another review, ''La Vraie Italie'', with [[Ardengo Soffici]].

Other books came from his pen. His ''Parole e Sangue'' ("Words and Blood") showed his fundamental atheism. Furthermore, Papini sought to create a scandal by speculating that [[Jesus]] and [[John the Apostle]] had a [[homosexual]] relationship.<ref>Orlandi, Daniela (2007), p. 1347.</ref> In [[1912 in literature|1912]] he published his best-known work, the [[autobiographical novel]] ''[[A Man — Finished|Un Uomo Finito]]'' (''A Man — Finished'' in the United Kingdom and ''The Failure'' in the United States).

In his 1915 collection of poetic prose ''Cento Pagine di Poesia'' (followed by ''Buffonate'', ''Maschilità'', and ''Stroncature''), Papini placed himself face-to-face with [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], but also contemporaries such as [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Giovanni Gentile]], and less prominent disciples of [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]. A critic wrote of him:

<blockquote>Giovanni Papini [...] is one of the finest minds in the Italy of today. He is an excellent representative of modernity's restless search for truth, and his work exhibits a refreshing independence founded, not like so much so-called independence, upon ignorance of the past, but upon a study and understanding of it.<ref>Goldberg, Isaac (1919). "The Intellectual Ferment in Post-Bellum Italy," ''The Bookman,'' Vol. L, No. 2, p. 158.</ref></blockquote>

He published [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] in 1917, grouped under the title ''Opera Prima''. In [[1921 in literature|1921]], Papini announced his newly found [[Roman Catholicism]],<ref>[[Sante De Sanctis|Sanctis, Sante de]] (1927). ''Religious Conversion, a Bio-Psychological Study.'' London: K. Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., ltd., p. 280.</ref><ref>Livingston, Arthur (1950). [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015038638212;view=1up;seq=62 "Papini Tells of his Intellectual Adventures."] In: ''Essays on Modern Italian Literature''. New York: S.F. Vanni, pp. 56–68.</ref> publishing his ''[[The Story of Christ|Storia di Cristo]]'' ("The Story of Christ"), a book which has been translated into twenty-three languages and has had worldwide success.<ref>"Giovanni Papini is the author of the ''Storia di Cristo'' (The Story of Christ), which marked his conversion to Catholicism. But his conversion has not checked his output, nor devitalized his art, which continued as before in the tradition of Carducci. His greatest novel is ''Un Uomo Finito'' (A Man — Finished), one of the fundamental works of modern Italian fiction. Papini's influence has been immense. His proud spiritual impulses, his restless ardour, his wealth of new and provocative ideas, and his crashing judgments, have been a strong stimulus to the younger generation, and have drawn to his side, if only temporarily, even writers of real independence." — Pirandello, Luigi (1967). [https://archive.org/stream/tendenciesofmode00unse#page/122/mode/2up "Italy."] In: ''Tendencies of the Modern Novel.'' Freeport, N.Y.: Books for Libraries Press, Inc., pp. 130–131.</ref>

After further verse works, he published the [[satire]] ''[[Gog (novel)|Gog]]'' ([[1931 in literature|1931]]) and the essay ''Dante Vivo'' ("Living Dante", or "If Dante Were Alive"; [[1933 in literature|1933]]).<ref>Beckett, Samuel (1934). ''Papini's Dante.'' London: Hodder and Stoughton.</ref>
[[File:Caricature of G. Papini.jpg|thumbnail|left|Drawing of Papini, by Julius Zirinsky.]]

==World War II and collaborations with Fascism==
He became a teacher at the [[University of Bologna]] in 1935 when the Fascist authorities confirmed Papini's "''impeccable reputation''" through the appointment. In 1937, Papini published the only volume of his ''History of Italian Literature'', which he dedicated to [[Benito Mussolini]]: "''to [[Duce|Il Duce]], friend of poetry and of the poets''",<ref>Traversi, D.A. (1939). "Giovanni Papini and Italian Literature," ''Scrutiny'' '''7''' (4), p. 415.</ref> being awarded top positions in [[academia]], especially in the study of [[Italian Renaissance]]. In 1940 Papini's ''Storia della Letteratura Italiana'' was published in Nazi Germany with the title ''Eternal Italy: The Great in its Empire of Letters'' (in German: ''Ewiges Italien – Die Großen im Reich seiner Dichtung'').

Papini was the vice president of the ''Europäische Schriftstellervereinigung'' (i.e. ''European Writers' League''), which was founded by [[Joseph Goebbels]] in 1941/42.<ref>Hausmann, Frank-Rutger (2004). ''"Dichte, Dichter, tage nicht!" Die Europäische Schriftsteller-Vereinigung in Weimar 1941–1948''. Frankfurt am Main: Vittorio Klostermann, p. 210 {{ISBN|3-465-03295-0}}</ref> When the Fascist regime crumbled in 1943, Papini entered a [[Franciscan]] [[convent]] in [[La Verna]], under the name "Fra' Bonaventura".<ref>Orlandi, Daniela (2007), p. 1347.</ref>

==Final years==

Largely discredited at the end of [[World War II]],{{sfn|Lachs|2008|p=562}} Papini was defended by the Catholic [[Right-wing politics|political right]]. His work concentrated on different subjects, including a biography of [[Michelangelo]], while he continued to publish dark and tragic essays. He collaborated with ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', contributing articles that were published as a volume after his death.

Papini had been suffering from progressive paralysis (due by [[motor neuron disease]]<ref>Roberto Ridolfi, Vita di Giovanni Papini, 1987, p. 211-212</ref>) and was blind during the last years of his life.  He died at the age of 75.<ref name="nyt-papini">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/07/09/archives/giovanni-papini-author-is-dead-italian-philosopher-75-who-wrote.html |title=Giovanni Papini, Author, Is Dead; Italian Philosopher, 75, Who Wrote 'Life of Christ,' Won Prize for Study of Dante |date=July 9, 1956 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2014-07-29 |page=23 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

[[File:Giovanni Papini's grave in Cimitero delle Porte Sante (Florence).jpg|thumbnail|right|Papini's grave in the ''[[Cimitero delle Porte Sante]]'' in [[Florence]].]]

According to art historian Richard Dorment,<ref>[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/3rd-april-1993/24/false-attribution ''The Spectator''], 2 April 1993, p. 24.</ref><ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/letter-that-notorious-fake-1429020.html "Letter: That Notorious Fake,"] ''The Independent'', 14 March 1994.</ref><ref>"The quotation occurs in an 'interview' with an Italian journalist named Giovanni Papini. It was published in 1951 in a volume of Papini's collected journalism entitled ''Il Libro Nero: Nuovo Diario di Gog'', a copy of which is in the British Library. That interview is a notorious fake. According to Pierre Daix, in his respected 1977 biography of Picasso, the artist knew about ''II Libro Nero'', but ignored it until 1955, when it was used against him by Franco's government. Because Picasso was a communist and this was the height of the Cold War, it was further disseminated by Nato intelligence. At this point, Picasso asked Daix to expose the whole affair, which Daix did in a series of articles in ''Les Lettres Françaises'' between 1962 and 1965. In the biography, Daix described the contents of ''II Libro Nero'' as 'imaginary interviews and false confessions'. Papini was not a fraud, but a journalist who used the literary device of the pretend interview to write profiles of famous people, including Kafka, Tolstoy, Freud, Molotov, Hitler, Cervantes, Goethe, William Blake and Robert Browning. Picasso never met Papini and never said the words Papini attributed to him." — [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/2nd-may-1998/27/fake-picasso ''The Spectator''], 1 May 1998, p. 27.</ref> [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime and [[NATO]] used Papini's series of imaginary interviews in the 1951 novel ''[[Il libro nero]]'' as propaganda against [[Pablo Picasso]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rFIEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22Giovanni+Papini%2C&pg=PA18 "Apology for a False Picasso 'Quote',"] ''Life,'' Vol. LXVI, No. 2, January 17, 1969, p. 18B.</ref> to dramatically undercut his pro-Communist image. In 1962, the artist asked his biographer [[Pierre Daix]], to expose the pretend interview, which he did in ''[[Les Lettres Françaises]]''.<ref>Pierre d'Aix, ''Les Lettres Francaises'', 12–18, Décembre, 1963.</ref>

He was admired by [[Bruno de Finetti]], founder of a subjective theory of probability, and [[Jorge Luis Borges]], who remarked that Papini had been "unjustly forgotten" and included some of his stories in the Library of Babel.<ref>Borges, Jorge Louis (1975).

==In popular culture==
*Papini appears as a character in several poems of the period written by [[Mina Loy]], who had an affair with him.<ref>Hofer, Matthew (2011). “Mina Loy, Giovanni Papini, and the Aesthetic of Irritation,” ''Paideuma'' '''38'''.</ref>
*[[Wallace Stevens]] wrote a poem called "Reply to Papini."
*Papini is repeatedly mentioned in speeches made by Colombian writer [[Gabriel García Marquez]].
