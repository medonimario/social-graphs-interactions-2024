== Philosophical views ==
Fumerton has argued for a classical [[internalist]] form of [[foundationalism]] in which foundationally justified beliefs are justified non-inferentially.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=DePaul|first=Michael R.|title=[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1-139-05750-9|editor-last=Audi|editor-first=Robert|editor-link=Robert Audi|edition=Third|location=New York|pages=397–398|chapter=Richard Fumerton}}</ref> Specifically, Fumerton believes that for a belief to be non-inferentially justified, it must be justified by [[Knowledge by acquaintance|direct acquaintance]] with facts and the correspondence between those facts and the belief in question.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Fumerton |first=Richard |title=A Companion to Epistemology |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-3900-7 |editor-last=Dancy |editor-first=Jonathan |edition=2nd |pages=139–143 |chapter=Twenty Epistemological Self-profiles: Richard Fumerton |editor-last2=Sosa |editor-first2=Ernest |editor-last3=Steup |editor-first3=Matthias |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4Wt5F_hC3AC&pg=PA139}}</ref> Fumerton's foundationalism is classical or "old-fashioned" in that it claims that foundationally justified beliefs are beliefs about one's states of mind rather than beliefs about the external world.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Barnes |first=Gordon |date=2003 |title=Resurrecting Old–Fashioned Foundationalism |url= |journal=Philosophical Books |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=53–62 |doi=10.1111/1468-0149.00281 |issn=0031-8051}}</ref> Given this fact, Fumerton has argued that we cannot have the philosophical assurance required for knowledge about the external world.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" /> He has argued that whilst [[externalist]] theories of justification provide non-inferentially justified beliefs about the external world, these justifications are "philosophically unsatisfying" and cannot provide philosophical assurance for beliefs about the external world.<ref name=":1" /> Given these arguments, Fumerton thinks that there is no philosophically satisfying account of how we could know about the external world, a view known as "metaepistemological scepticism".<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite thesis|title=Meta-Epistemological Scepticism: Criticisms and a Defence|url=https://philpapers.org/archive/RANMSC.pdf|publisher=[[The University of Edinburgh]]|date=2015|degree=PhD|first=Chris|last=Ranalli}} pp. 1-2.</ref> He has also argued for a "principle of inferential justification" that states that for a subject ''S'' to be justified in believing a proposition ''P'' on the basis of another proposition ''E'', ''S'' must be justified in believing that ''E'' and they must be justified in believing that ''E'' makes ''P'' probable.<ref name=":1" />

In philosophical inquiry into the nature of rationality, Fumerton has been credited by Richard Foley with formulating a problem that Foley calls "Fumerton's puzzle".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foley|first=Richard|date=1990|title=Fumerton's Puzzle|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/oom/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=&rft.imuse_id=jpr_1990_0015_0109_0113&svc_id=info:www.pdcnet.org/collection|journal=Journal of Philosophical Research|volume=15|pages=109–113|doi=10.5840/jpr_1990_10|issn=1053-8364|url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Foley|first=Richard|date=1991|title=Audi on Practical Reasoning|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27759255|journal=Behavior and Philosophy|volume=19|issue=2|pages=59–72|jstor=27759255 |issn=1053-8348}}</ref> A theory of rationality attempts to provide the conditions ''C'' under which a belief or decision is rational.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Ye|first=Ru|date=2015|title=Fumerton's Puzzle for Theories of Rationality|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048402.2014.955862|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|language=en|volume=93|issue=1|pages=93–108|doi=10.1080/00048402.2014.955862|s2cid=171046040 |issn=0004-8402}}</ref> Fumerton's puzzle arises when candidate conditions are met, but an agent rationally believes that they are not met. Assuming that the agent believes that ''C'' must be met for their belief or decision to be rational, then in this case they would rationally believe that their belief or decision is irrational even though it satisfies the conditions ''C''. When paired with the idea that it is irrational to have a belief or make a decision if one rationally believes that it is irrational, this implies that a belief or decision can be irrational even if ''C'' are satisfied. But this means that ''C'' are not sufficient conditions for rationality, implying that finding such conditions is impossible.<ref name=":4" /> Fumerton's puzzle can also occur when the conditions are not met, but an agent rationally believes that they are. In such a case, the agent would rationally believe that their belief or decision is rational. However, the agent's rational belief that their belief or decision is rational seems sufficient to make them rational even if ''C'' is not satisfied. This implies that ''C'' are not necessary conditions for a belief or decision to be rational.<ref name=":3" />

Fumerton defended [[mind-body dualism]] in his book ''Knowledge, Thought and the Case for Dualism'', published in 2013.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Yetter-Chappell, Helen|year=2013|title=Knowledge, Thought, and the Case for Dualism|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|url=https://academic.oup.com/pq/article-abstract/66/263/435/2460891|volume=66|issue=263|pages=435–438|doi=10.1093/pq/pqv053}}</ref>
