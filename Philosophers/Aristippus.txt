== Life ==
Aristippus, the son of Aritades, was born in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], [[Ancient Libya]], c. 435 BCE. Having come to [[Greece]] to attend the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic games]], he met and asked [[Ischomachus]] about [[Socrates]], resulting in a strong desire to see [[Socrates]], after hearing of his description. Seeking [[Socrates]], he went to [[Athens]] and made him his master.<ref>Plutarch, ''De Curios.'' 2.</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology, Abaeus, Ariste'nus Ale'xius, Aristippus |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0104:alphabetic+letter=A:entry+group=41:entry=aristippus-bio-4 |access-date=2023-06-04 |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>

Though a disciple of [[Socrates]], Aristippus wandered both in principle and practice from the teaching and example of his master.<ref name=":3" /> After learning the philosophical views and values of [[Socrates]], Aristippus formed a greater interest in pleasure, eventually leading him to popularize and focus more solely on ethical hedonism.<ref name=":1" /> Due to his philosophical differences from Socrates, Aristippus sought other avenues, leading him towards the court of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]] or [[Dionysius the Younger]]. At the court Aristippus became a counselor, and continued to seek his pleasures.<ref name=":1" /> While there he lived luxuriously and sought sensual gratification and the company of the notorious [[Lais of Corinth|Lais]].<ref name=":1" /> Additionally, Aristippus was the first of [[Socrates]]' disciples to make money for his teaching, which on occasion he sent to [[Socrates]], although often returned to him, due to [[Socrates]] viewing it as an insult.<ref>Being the first of the disciples of Socrates who did so {{harv|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 65}}.</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last=Laërtius |first=Diogenes |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_II#Aristippus |title=Lives of the Eminent Philosophers}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=Aristippus and the Pursuit of Pleasure {{!}} Classical Wisdom Weekly |url=https://classicalwisdom.com/people/philosophers/aristippus-pursuit-pleasure/ |access-date=2023-06-04 |website=classicalwisdom.com}}</ref> Aristippus also said that he resided in a foreign land in order to escape the trouble of involving himself in the politics of his native city, to [[Socrates]].<ref>Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'', ii. 1.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Memorabilia, by Xenophon |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1177/1177-h/1177-h.htm |access-date=2023-06-04 |website=www.gutenberg.org}}</ref><ref name=":3" />

Due to his lifelong pursuit of pleasure and philosophical teachings on pleasure, against the teachings of [[Socrates]], Aristippus garnered conflict between philosophers like [[Socrates]] and his fellow-pupils over the course of his life.<ref name=":1" /> He is also said to have been taken prisoner by [[Artaphernes]], the satrap who drove the [[Sparta]]ns from [[Rhodes]] in 396.<ref>Diodorus, xiv. 79.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Diodorus Siculus, Library, Book XIV, Chapter 79 |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.%2014.79&lang=original |access-date=2023-06-04 |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> Despite the backlash he received for his philosophical views, teachings and lifestyle, Aristippus continued his spread of ethical hedonism by imparting his doctrine to his daughter [[Arete of Cyrene|Arete]] who, in turn, imparted it to her son, [[Aristippus the Younger]], who is said to have reduced it to a system in the [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaic school]] of philosophy, that Aristippus helped found.<ref name=":3" /> In old age, Aristippus is said to have returned to [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], living out his retirement in luxury and in the pursuit of pleasure till his death, at the age of 79.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":5" />

In Book VI of ''[[De architectura]]'', [[Vitruvius]] describes Aristippus:
<blockquote>It is related of the [[Socrates|Socratic]] philosopher Aristippus that, being shipwrecked and cast ashore on the coast of the [[Rhodians]], he observed [[geometrical]] figures drawn thereon, and cried out to his companions: "Let us be of good cheer, for I see the traces of man." With that he made for the city of Rhodes, and went straight to the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]. There he fell to discussing [[philosophical]] subjects, and presents were bestowed upon him, so that he could not only fit himself out, but could also provide those who accompanied him with clothing and all other necessaries of life. When his companions wished to return to their country, and asked him what message he wished them to carry home, he bade them say this: that children ought to be provided with property and resources of a kind that could swim with them even out of a shipwreck.<ref>Vitruvius, vi. 1.</ref></blockquote>

==Philosophy==
{{main|Cyrenaics}}

{{Hedonism}}
Aristippus' philosophies centered around hedonism. Having been a pupil of [[Socrates]], Aristippus recognized [[Socrates]]' enjoyment of things like parties, the drinking of wine and accepting gifts.<ref name=":1" /> Intrigued by such acts, Aristippus eventually formed the philosophy of ethical [[hedonism]]. Aristippus viewed pleasure and the pursuit of pleasure as life's supreme good, as well as valued the importance of not becoming possessed or enslaved by such pleasurable acts and objects.<ref name=":1" /> By way of his philosophy, Aristippus' famous phrase, "I possess, I am not possessed," emerged.<ref name=":2" /> Having stressed his beliefs, Aristippus admonished his followers to never harm others, and cautioned that the pursuit of pleasure ought to be moderated by moral self-restraint.<ref name=":1" /> After forming his philosophy, Aristippus started the [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaic school]] of philosophy where his philosophical principles would be taught, further structured, and turned into a comprehensive system by his daughter, [[Arete of Cyrene|Arete]], and his grandson, [[Aristippus the Younger]].<ref name=":1" />

Despite Aristippus' bringing attention to the value of pursuing pleasure albeit in moderation, Aristippus' hedonistic philosophy often received backlash by [[Socrates]] and his fellow-pupils. While [[Socrates]] did indulge in such activities like parties, drinking wine and accepting gifts, Socrates viewed virtue as more valuable than pleasure.<ref name=":1" /> Since Aristippus valued pleasure more than [[Socrates]] did and found less intrinsic value in virtue, other philosophers, like [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]], supported as well as initiated the accusation that Aristippus had defied and had strayed from [[Socrates]]' philosophical teachings.<ref name=":1" /> [[Aristotle]] is also noted for calling him a [[sophist]].<ref name=":3" /> Due to the differences in philosophical values and beliefs, Aristippus and his hedonistic philosophy separated him from [[Socrates]] as well as from other prominent philosophers at that time. One notable example of philosophers demonstrating disdain for Aristippus' values is in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]],'' where [[Plato]] describes Aristippus having been at [[Aegina]], a pleasure resort, rather attending as a witness of [[Socrates]]' death.

Of the anecdotes that survive about Aristippus, those from [[Diogenes Laërtius]] are the most abundant.<ref name=":0">Horace, ''Ep.'' i. 1. 18</ref><ref name=":3" /> Diogenes asserts, for example,  that to observe the precepts of Aristippus is "to endeavor to adapt circumstances to myself, not myself to circumstances"<ref>Horace, i. 17. 23.</ref> and that, "every complexion of life, every station and circumstance sat gracefully upon him." Another such report is of Aristippus being reproached for his love of bodily indulgences, to which Aristippus is said to have answered, "It is not abstinence from pleasures that is best, but mastery over them without ever being worsted."<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphys.'' iii. 2.</ref><ref name=":4" />

==Works==
None of Aristippus's works are extant. Diogenes Laërtius, on the authority of [[Sotion]] and [[Panaetius]], gives a long list of books whose authorship is ascribed to Aristippus, though he also states that according to [[Sosicrates]] of Rhodes, Aristippus never wrote anything.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 83-5}}<ref name=":1" /> Some letters attributed to him are said by some to be forgeries.

One work attributed to Aristippus in ancient times was a book entitled ''On Ancient Luxury'' (or ''On the Luxury of the Ancients''; {{langx|el|Περὶ παλαιᾶς τρυφῆς}}); although it has long been considered that this work could not have been written by Aristippus of Cyrene,<ref>"Aristippus" entry in Alexander Chalmers, (1812), ''The General Biographical Dictionary Containing An Historical And Critical Account Of The Lives And Writings Of The Most Eminent Persons In Every Nation'', page 458.</ref> not least because the author mentions [[Theophrastus]], who lived a generation after Aristippus.<ref name="Castle"/> The name may have been adopted by the writer to suggest a connection with the hedonistic philosopher.<ref name="Gutzwiller">Kathryn J. Gutzwiller, (1998), ''Poetic garlands: Hellenistic epigrams in context'', p. 50. University of California Press</ref> This work, judging by the quotations preserved by [[Diogenes Laertius|Diogenes Laërtius]],<ref>Laërtius 1925, i. § 96; {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=ii. §  23, 48–49}}; Laërtius 1925, iii. § 29–32; Laërtius 1925, iv. 19; v. 3–4, 39; Laërtius 1925, viii. 60.</ref> has also been presumed to have been filled with anecdotes about philosophers and their supposed taste for [[Hetaera|courtesans]] or [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|boys]].<ref name="Castle">Warren James Castle, (1951), ''The Platonic epigrams'', p. 14.</ref>
