'''John Sergeant''' (1621–1707 or 1710) was an English [[Roman Catholic]] priest, controversialist and theologian.

==Life==

He was a son of William Sergeant, a [[yeoman]] in [[Barrow-upon-Humber]], [[Lincolnshire]], and was admitted in 1639 as a sub-[[sizar]] at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1643.<ref>{{acad|id=SRGT639J|name=Sergeant, John}}</ref> On the recommendation of [[William Beale (college head)|William Beale]] he was appointed secretary to [[Thomas Morton (bishop)|Thomas Morton]], the [[Anglican]] [[Bishop of Durham]], time he spent on transcriptions of the [[Church Fathers]].  A year or so later, he converted to [[Catholicism]] as result of his studies.<ref name=DNB>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Sergeant, John}}</ref>

He subsequently moved to the [[English College, Lisbon]]. He studied [[theology]] and in 1650 was ordained as a [[Catholic]] priest.  He subsequently taught at the college until 1652, when he became procurator and prefect of studies. From 1653 to 1654, he worked as a priest in England before returning to Lisbon where he resumed his earlier work and taught philosophy. In 1655 he was elected canon and appointed as secretary. For the next twenty years he was actively engaged in controversy, both with [[Anglican]]s such as the bishops [[Edward Stillingfleet]] and [[John Tillotson]], and Catholics who differed from [[Thomas White (scholar)|Thomas White]].

At the time of the [[Oates Plot]] he entered into communication with the [[Privy Council]] which greatly scandalized the Catholics. This arose from his opposition to [[Jesuit]] influence in the English Catholic Church.  He avoided arrest by passing as a physician under the names of Dodd, Holland, and Smith. There is an original painting of him at [[Ushaw College]], in Durham.

==Works==

He was reportedly difficult to work with, saying and writing many things that offended even his co-religionists.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=John Sergeant|first=Edwin|last=Burton}}</ref> He was a voluminous writer, leaving over fifty works, either published or in manuscript.

His three philosophical works, written late in life, were:

1. ''The Method to Science''. London, 1696.

2. ''Solid Philosophy Asserted, Against the Fancies of the Ideists: or, The Method to Science Farther Illustrated. With Reflexions on Mr. Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. London, 1697.

3. ''Transnatural Philosophy, or Metaphysicks: Demonstrating the Essences and Operations of all Beings whatever, which gives the Principles to all other Sciences. And shewing the perfect Conformity of Christian Faith to Right Reason, and the Unreason ableness of Atheists, Deists, Anti-trinitarians, and other Sectaries''. London, 1700.
