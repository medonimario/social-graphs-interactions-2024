==Biography==

On November 25, 1904, Li Yaotang was born in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, into a wealthy Li family. The family's wealth came mainly from the land acquired by his grandfather and father when they were officials, and Li Yaotang sometimes described his family as a "typical landlord's family".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lang |first1=Olga |title=Pa Chin And His Writings: Chinese Youth Between The Two Revolutions |date=1967 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=9780674650503 |page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kong |first1=Haili |title=Disease and Humanity: Ba Jin and His Ward Four: A Wartime Novel of China |journal=Frontiers of Literary Studies in China |date=5 June 2012 |volume=6 |issue=2 |page=199 |doi=10.3868/s010-001-012-0012-8 |access-date=5 October 2023 |url=https://journal.hep.com.cn/flsc/EN/10.3868/s010-001-012-0012-8}}</ref> In 1919, Ba read Kropotkin's ''[[An Appeal to the Young]]'' and converted to anarchism.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ng |first1=Mau Sang |title=Ba Jin and Russian Literature |journal=Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews (CLEAR) |date=1981 |volume=3 |issue=1 |page=69 |doi=10.2307/495337 |jstor=495337 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/495337 |access-date=20 February 2023 |issn=0161-9705}}</ref>

It was partly owing to boredom that Ba Jin began to write his first novel, ''Miewang'' {{lang|zh|灭亡}} (“Destruction”).<ref>[[Jaroslav Průšek]] and Zbigniew Słupski, eds., Dictionary of Oriental Literatures: East Asia (Charles Tuttle, 1978): 135-136.</ref> In France, Ba Jin continued his anarchist activism, translating many anarchist works, including Kropotkin's ''[[Ethics: Origin and Development|Ethics]]'', into Chinese, which was mailed back to Shanghai's anarchist magazines for publication.<ref>See Angel Pino, “Ba Jin as Translator,” tr. Ian MacCabe, in Peng Hsiao-yen & Isabelle Rabut (eds.), ''Modern China and the West: Translation and Cultural Mediation''. Leiden-Boston: Brill, “East Asian Comparative Literature and Culture” (2), 2014, 28-105.</ref>

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Ba Jin was heavily persecuted as a counter-revolutionary.<ref name="nytimes_obit_2005"/> His wife since 1944, Xiao Shan, died of cancer in 1972.<ref name="nytimes_obit_2005"/> He asked that a Cultural Revolution Museum be set up in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lisa.gerda-henkel-stiftung.de/mystifizierung_der_kulturrevolution?nav_id=6972|title="Mystifizierung der Kulturrevolution" (Interview with Nora Sausmikat)|first=Nana|last=Sippel|publisher=[[:de:Gerda Henkel Stiftung]]|date=18 May 2017|access-date=28 August 2021|language=de|archive-date=14 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814024932/https://lisa.gerda-henkel-stiftung.de/mystifizierung_der_kulturrevolution?nav_id=6972|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Shantou Cultural Revolution Museum]] referenced the influence of Ba Jin on its establishment through displaying a depiction of his at the entrance<ref>{{cite book|last=Li|first=Jie|title=Utopian Ruins: A Memorial Museum of the Mao Era|date=2020|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-147-801-018-0|page=231|language=en}}</ref> as well as a quote of his, "Every town in China should establish a museum about the Cultural Revolution."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/shining-a-light-on-mao-s-dark-era-1.460744|title=Shining a light on Mao's dark era|first=Clifford|last=Coonan|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=27 June 2005|access-date=23 August 2021|archive-date=9 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220409154637/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/shining-a-light-on-mao-s-dark-era-1.460744|url-status=live}}</ref>

Ba Jin's works were heavily influenced by foreign writers, including [[Émile Zola]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Alexander Herzen]], [[Anton Chekhov]], and [[Emma Goldman]].<ref>He described Goldman as his "spiritual mother", and dedicated ''The General'' to her. See Preface, ''The General'', and Olga Lang, ''Pa Chin and His Writings: Chinese Youth Between the Wars'' (Harvard University Press, 1967).</ref>

Ba Jin suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]] beginning in 1983. The illness confined him to [[Huadong Hospital]] in Shanghai from 1998.<ref name="guardian_obit_2005"/>
