==Controversy over his apostasy==
Hanafi's book "An Invitation for Dialogue" was accused by conservative Islamic scholars as heresy and apostasy.<ref>http://www.arabwestreport.info/?q=node/3749 (Arab West Report Art. 27, Week 20/2000, 10 – 16 May)</ref>

His liberal opinions about Islam infuriated conservative Islamic scholars and [[Al-Azhar Mosque|Azhar]]. For example, he stated that the name of the God should be changed to "Transcendence". Conservative scholars from al-Azhar refuted that Hanafi was distorting Islam.<ref>http://www.arabwestreport.info/?q=node/4809 (Arab West Report Art. 11, Week 25/2001, 20 – 26 June)</ref> There was a fatwa, an Islamic opinion issued by Islamic scholars, that condemned Hanafi as an apostate. This raised controversy in Egypt, as many liberals disagreed with the charge that Hanafi was an apostate.<ref>http://www.arabwestreport.info/?q=node/14399 (Arab West Report Art. 2, Week 51/1997, 19 – 25 December )</ref>
