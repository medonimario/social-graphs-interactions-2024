'''Richard Arthur Wollheim''' (5 May 1923 − 4 November 2003) was a [[British people|British]] [[philosopher]] noted for original work on [[philosophy of mind|mind]] and [[emotion]]s, especially as related to the [[visual art]]s, specifically, [[painting]].  Wollheim served as the president of the [[British Society of Aesthetics]] from 1992 onwards until his death in 2003.

==Biography==
Richard Wollheim was the son of Eric Wollheim, a [[theatre]] [[impresario]], and Constance (Connie) Mary Baker, an [[actress]] who used the stage name Constance Luttrell.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2004-12-18 |title=Review: Germs by Richard Wollheim |url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/dec/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview26 |access-date=2022-08-26 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref> He attended [[Westminster School]], London, and [[Balliol College, Oxford]] (1941–2, 1945–8), interrupted by active military service in World War&nbsp;II.<ref>For his own account of his service in Europe during the war, see Wollheim, "Fifty Years On", ''London Review of Books'' 23 (23 Je 1994): 3–6.</ref> In 1949 he obtained a [[congratulatory first]] in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, and began teaching at [[University College London]], where he became [[Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic|Grote Professor of Mind and Logic]] and Department Head from 1963 to 1982. He retired from that position to take up professorships, first, at [[Columbia University]] (1982–85) and then the [[University of California at Berkeley]] (1985–2002). He chaired the Department at UC Berkeley, 1998–2002. On retirement from Berkeley, he served briefly as a guest lecturer at [[Balliol College]]. Additionally, he held visiting positions at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Minnesota]], [[Graduate Center, CUNY]], the [[University of California at Davis]], and elsewhere. Wollheim gave several distinguished lecture series, most notably the Andrew M. Mellon lectures in Fine Arts, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (1984), published as ''Painting as an Art''.

In 1962, Wollheim published an article "A paradox in the theory of democracy",<ref>In "Philosophy, Politics and Society", edited by Peter Laslett and W.G. Runciman, published by Basil Blackwell, 1962. Pp. 71-87.</ref> in which he argued that a supporter of democracy faces a contradiction when he votes. On the one hand he wants a particular party or candidate to win, but on the other hand he wants whoever wins the most votes to win. This has become known as [[Wollheim's paradox]].

His ''Art and its Objects'' was one of the twentieth century's most influential texts on philosophical [[aesthetics]] in English. In a 1965 essay, '[[Minimal Art]]', he seems to have coined the phrase, although its meaning eventually drifted from his. As well as for his work on the philosophy of art, Wollheim was known for his philosophical treatments of [[depth psychology]], especially [[Sigmund Freud]]'s.<ref>He was also Ernest Jones Lecturer at the Institute of Psychoanalysis in London in 1968.</ref> His posthumously-published autobiography of youth, ''Germs: A Memoir of Childhood'',<ref>[http://waywiser-press.com/wollheim.html For excerpts from eighteen reviews, see] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120153441/http://www.waywiser-press.com/wollheim.html |date=20 November 2008 }}</ref> with complementary essays, discloses a good deal about his family background and his life up to early manhood, providing valuable material for understanding his interests and sensibility.

==Personal life==
Wollheim married Anne Barbara Denise (1920–2004), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel [[George Powell (British Army officer)|George Powell]], of the [[Grenadier Guards]], after her divorce from her first husband, the literary critic [[Philip Toynbee]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/27/guardianobituaries|title=Obituary: Anne Wollheim|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=27 November 2004}}</ref><ref>Enlightening: Letters 1946-1960, Isaiah Berlin, ed.
