== Biography ==
Bergmann was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. He earned his Ph.D. in mathematics at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1928. His dissertation, directed by [[Walther Mayer]], was titled ''Zwei Beiträge zur mehrdimensionalen Differentialgeometrie''. While studying for his [[doctorate]], he was invited to join the [[Vienna Circle]], a group of philosophers, mathematicians, scientists, and others committed to a scientific worldview under the name of [[logical positivism]]. In 1930–31, he worked with [[Albert Einstein]] in Berlin. Unable as a Jew to find academic employment, Bergmann obtained a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from the University of Vienna in 1935, and practiced [[corporate law]] until he and his family fled to the United States in 1938. Settling at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City]] in 1939, Bergmann eventually became professor of both philosophy and psychology.

He died in Iowa City.
