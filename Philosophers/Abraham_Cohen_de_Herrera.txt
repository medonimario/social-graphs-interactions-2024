'''Abraham Cohen de Herrera''' ({{langx|he|רבי אברהם כהן בן דוד דה-הירירה}}), also known as '''Alonso Nunez de Herrera''' or '''Abraham Irira''' (c. 1570 – c. 1635), was a [[Philosophy of religion|religious philosopher]] and [[Kabbalah|cabbalist]] (a student of [[Israel Sarug]], who was one of [[Isaac Luria|Isaac Luria's]] disciples<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jose|first=Faur|date=1996-08-29|title=On David Nieto|url=https://archive.org/details/on-david-nieto-8-29-96|at=13:04|format=.mp3|quote=This man is fascinated by one subject, and he studies; and for the sephardim, this is the maximum authority....There is no bigger authority than "Ha Ari"...

This man is fascinated by one subject, and he studies; and for the sephardim, this is the maximum authority....There is no bigger authority than "[[Isaac Luria|Ha Ari]]"... And he had one student...[[Israel Sarug|Israel Srugo]]...And this man Abraham Cohen de Herrera, becomes a pupil of a pupil of Ha Ari.</ref>). He is supposed by the historian [[Heinrich Graetz]] to have been born in 1570. He is widely supposed to have been descended from a [[Marrano]] family: place of birth is unknown but may (according to Barbosa Machado the [[List of biographers|biographer]]) have been [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. Other sources link him to [[Italy]], specifically [[Tuscany]], and as the son of the last Chief Rabbi of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in [[Spain]].

He is known to have married a Sara de Herrera in [[Amsterdam]] in 1600; however, it is unlikely that this is the wife's original surname. It is also reasonably certain that he had an uncle, Juan de Marchena, who worked as a factor for the [[List of rulers of Morocco|Sultan of Morocco]] Moulay, [[Ahmad al-Mansur]].

While in [[Cadiz]] on the [[Sultan]]'s business, Herrera is supposed to have been captured by the [[Kingdom of England|English]], was released again after an exchange of [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] correspondence between the Sultan and [[List of monarchs of England|Queen]] [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and travelled thereafter to Amsterdam, where he returned to [[Judaism]]. His date of death is between 1635 and 1639: Wiener believes it was 1635. According to Rodriguez de Castro he may have died in [[Vienna]]. He wrote several works, originally in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] but later (in accordance with his will) translated to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

==Works==
*The following works by Herrera, in Spanish, are known: (1) ''Puerta del Cielo'', expounding kabbalistic doctrine about God and the cosmos. (2) ''Casa de Dios'', which deals mainly with theories about angels and pneumatology. Both works remained unpublished in the original for centuries (manuscripts are to be found in the library ''Eẓ Ḥayyim'' at Amsterdam and in the Royal Library of Holland), but were translated into Hebrew by [[Isaac Aboab da Fonseca]] and published under the title ''Sha'ar ha-Shamayim (Amsterdam, 1655), and ''Beit Elohim'' (Amsterdam, 1655).<ref>Both the [https://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7609-herrera-alonzo-de ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' (1906)] and the [https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/herrera-abraham-kohen-de ''Encyclopaedia Judaica (2007)''] entries on him state this.</ref>

*''Puerta Del Cielo'', a discourse on [[kabbalah]] and religious themes of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], in relation to Occidentalism and Platonic philosophy.  Among few texts of the Kabbalah written and directed toward common readership; criticized as such. Translated into English by Kenneth Krabbenhoft, {{ISBN|978-90-04-12253-6}}.

*''Epistle on Shiur Qomah'', an attempted reconciliation between [[kabbalah]] and philosophy. However, as [[Alexander Altmann]], writes "Herrera was too much of a genuine philosopher to believe in the possibility of a fusion of the two realms, and he was too much of a genuine kabbalist to wish for it."
