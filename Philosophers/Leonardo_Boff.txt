'''Leonardo Boff''' ({{IPA|pt|leoˈnaʁdu ˈbɔf|lang}}; born '''Genézio Darci Boff'''; {{IPA|pt|ʒeˈnɛzju daʁˈsi ˈbɔf|pron}}; 14 December 1938) is a Brazilian [[theologian]], [[philosopher]] writer, and former [[Catholic]] priest known for his active support for [[Latin American liberation theology]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Oswald de Andrade |url=https://educacao.uol.com.br/biografias/oswald-de-andrade.htm |access-date=2023-05-28 |website=educacao.uol.com.br |language=pt-br}}</ref> 

He is professor emeritus of ethics, philosophy of religion, and ecology at the [[Rio de Janeiro State University]]. In 2001, he received the [[Right Livelihood Award]] for "his inspiring insights and practical work to help people realise the links between human spirituality, social justice and environmental stewardship."

== Studies as a priest ==
Boff was born in 1938 in [[Concórdia]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], Brazil. He entered the [[Franciscan Order]] in 1959 and was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1964. He spent the following years studying for a [[doctorate]] in [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Munich]], which he received in 1970. Boff's doctoral [[thesis]] studied in what measure the Church can be a sign of the sacred and the divine in the secular world and in the process of liberation of the oppressed. His thesis was published in [[German language|German]] in 1972 as ''Die Kirche als Sakrament im Horizont der Welterfahrung''.<ref>Thils, G., [https://www.persee.fr/doc/thlou_0080-2654_1972_num_3_4_1206_t1_0480_0000_2 Leonatrdo Boff, Die Kirche als Sakrament im Horizont der Welterfahrung (review)], published in ''Revue Théologique de Louvain'', 1972, 3-4  pp. 480-481 (in French), accessed 3 April 2023</ref>

His brother is the theologian [[Clodovis Boff]].

== Liberation theology ==
Boff became one of the best-known supporters (along with [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], [[Juan Luis Segundo]] and [[Jon Sobrino]]) of the early [[Latin American liberation theology|liberation theologians]]. He was present in the first reflections that sought to articulate indignation against poverty and marginalisation with a promissory discourse on [[faith]], leading to [[Latin American liberation theology]]. He continues to be a controversial figure in the [[Catholic Church]], primarily for his sharp criticism of the church's hierarchy, which he sees as "fundamentalist"{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}, but also for his political positions.

== Political views ==
Boff is critical of secular power, as well of [[American foreign policy]]. He opposed the [[Iraq War]] and considered [[George W. Bush]] and [[Ariel Sharon]]'s leadership to be similar to that of "fundamentalist terrorist states". He also criticizes despotic rulers in the [[Middle East]], saying: "Those [emirs and kings] are despotic, they do not even have a constitution. Though extremely rich, they maintain the people in poverty."<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.comunitaitaliana.com.br/Entrevistas/boff.htm Interview to the Comunità Italiana]: "[Os USA] fizeram alianças espúrias com os emires e reis. Estes são despóticos, sequer possuem constituição. Embora riquíssimos, mantém o povo na pobreza." November 2001</ref>

Boff has voiced his supported for the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allpro&mapgroup=pro|title=Overview|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref>

== Laicization ==
Authorities in the Catholic Church did not consider Boff's views of the Church's leadership acceptable. They also saw his support of liberation theology as having "politicized everything" and reproached his proximity to [[Marxism]]. In 1985, the [[Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith|Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], directed at that time by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), silenced him for a year for his book ''Church: Charism and Power''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cox |first=Harvey |author-link=Harvey Cox |title=The Silencing of Leonardo Boff: The Vatican and the Future of World Christianity |publisher=Meyer-Stone Books |place=Oak Park, IL |year=1988 |isbn=0-940989-35-2 |oclc=18193194 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/silencingofleona00coxhrich/page/178 178–88] |url=https://archive.org/details/silencingofleona00coxhrich/page/178 }}</ref> He later accused Ratzinger of "religious terrorism".<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.comunitaitaliana.com.br/Entrevistas/boff.htm Interview to the Comunità Italiana]: "Um Cardeal como J. Ratzinger, ..., comete terrorismo religioso, ... ."  November 2001</ref>

Boff was almost silenced again in 1992 by [[Holy See|Rome]], this time to prevent him from participating in the Eco-92 [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], which finally led him to leave the [[Franciscan]] religious order and the priestly ministry.

Boff joined the international group of Catholic Scholars who in 2012 issued the [[Catholic Scholars' Declaration on Authority in the Church|Jubilee Declaration on reform of authority in the Catholic Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchauthority.org/sponsors/sponsorsa-b.asp#boff|title=Sponsors of the Catholic Scholars' Declaration A-B|work=Authority in the Catholic Church|publisher=[[John Wijngaards Catholic Research Centre]]|access-date=23 November 2013}}</ref>

For most of his life Boff has worked as a professor in the academic fields of [[theology]], [[ethics]] and [[philosophy]] throughout Brazil and also as lecturer in many universities abroad such as [[University of Lisbon]], [[University of Barcelona]], [[University of Lund]], [[University of Oslo]], [[University of Torino]] and others.

Boff commented on the election of [[Pope Francis]] in March 2013: "I am encouraged by this choice, viewing it as a pledge for a church of [[simple living|simplicity]] and of [[ecologism|ecological]] ideals."<ref>{{cite news|last=Schmall|first=Emily|title=A Conservative With a Common Touch|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/world/europe/new-pope-theologically-conservative-but-with-a-common-touch.html|access-date=20 March 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=13 March 2013}}</ref> He said the new pope was conservative in many respects but had liberal views on some subjects as well.<ref>{{cite news|title=L.
