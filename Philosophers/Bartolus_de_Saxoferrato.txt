'''Bartolus de Saxoferrato''' (Italian: ''Bartolo da Sassoferrato''; 1313{{snd}}13 July 1357) was an Italian law professor and one of the most prominent continental jurists of [[Medieval Roman Law]]. He belonged to the school known as the commentators or [[postglossator]]s. The admiration of later generations of civil lawyers is shown by the adage ''nemo bonus íurista nisi bartolista'' &mdash; no one is a good lawyer unless he is a Bartolist (i.e. a follower of Bartolus).

==Life and works==
Bartolus was born in the village of Venatura, near [[Sassoferrato]], in the Italian region of [[Marche]]. His father was Franciscus Severi, and his mother was of the Alfani family. He read civil law at the [[University of Perugia]] under [[Cino da Pistoia|Cinus]], and in the [[University of Bologna]] under [[Oldradus de Ponte|Oldradus]] and [[Jacobus de Belviso|Belviso]], and graduated to doctor of law in 1334. In 1339 he started teaching first in [[Pisa]], then in [[Perugia]]. He raised the character of Perugia's law school to a level with that of [[Bologna]], and this city made him an honorary citizen in 1348. In 1355, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] appointed him as his ''consiliarius''. In Perugia [[Baldus de Ubaldis]] and his brothers Angelus and Petrus became pupils of Bartolus. Bartolus died in Perugia at the age of 43, and was interred in the church of San Francisco with a monument inscribed with "Ossa Bartoli".<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bartolus|volume=3|pages=451-452}}</ref>

Despite his short life, Bartolus left an extraordinary number of works. He wrote commentaries on all parts of the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. He is also the author of a large number of treatises on specific subjects. Among these treatises is his famous book on the law relating to rivers (''[[De fluminibus seu Tyberiadis]]''). There are also almost 400 legal opinions (''consilia'') written at the request of judges or private parties seeking legal advice.

Bartolus developed many novel legal concepts, which became part of the civil law tradition. Among his most important contributions were those to the area of conflict of laws – a field of great importance in 14th century Italy, where every [[city-state]] had its own statutes and customs. Bartolus also dealt with a variety of [[constitutional law]] issues. In his treatise ''[[De insigniis et armis]]'' he discussed not only the [[law of Arms]] but also some problems of [[trademark]] law.

Bartolus also wrote on political issues, including the legitimacy of [[Local government|city government]]s, partisan divisions and the regimes of Italy's petty tyrants.  His political thought balanced respect for the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] with defense of the legitimacy of local Italian governments.

Bartolus is believed to be the first theorist of [[international law]].<ref name="Nefff_2018">{{cite book|first1=Stephen|last1=C Neff|title=International Law|chapter-url=|chapter=A short history of international law|page=7|oclc=1052766069|isbn=9780198791836|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|doi=10.1093/he/9780198791836.003.0001|access-date=May 21, 2021|archive-date=December 19, 2022|url-status=dead|url=https://www.academia.edu/42071394|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221219012617/https://www.academia.edu/42071394}}</ref> He and his disciple [[Baldus de Ubaldis|Baldus of Ubaldis]] defined a set of norms which enforced the reciprocal [[Independent city|independency]] and [[Autonomous area|autonomy]] of the city-states of northern Italy, but into the cornerstone of a common discipline established by the Empire.<ref name="Nefff_2018" /> While the city-states were internally self-governing, their mutual relationships were governed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

==Legacy==
Already famous in his lifetime, Bartolus was later regarded as the greatest jurist after the renaissance of [[Roman law]]. 
This is evident not only from the above-quoted saying, but also from the fact that statutes in [[Spain]] 1427/1433 and [[Portugal]] 1446 provided that his opinions should be followed where the Roman source texts and the [[Accursius|Accursian]] gloss were silent. 
[[Lorenzo Valla]] was driven out of the [[University of Pavia]] in 1431 for his critique of Bartolus' Latin style.  
Even in England, where the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] he had worked on was not applicable, Bartolus was held in high esteem. 
He influenced civilian writers such as [[Alberico Gentili]] and [[Richard Zouch]].

Due to Bartolus' fame, his name was used for the character of a lawyer in many Italian plays and other works, for example Dr. Bartolo in [[Pierre Beaumarchais]]' ''[[The Barber of Seville (play)]]'', and hence [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s opera ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''.
