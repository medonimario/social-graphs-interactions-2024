== Early life ==
On May 31, 1919, Huston Cummings Smith was born in [[Changshu|Dzang Zok]], [[Suzhou, China]], to [[Methodist]] missionaries and spent his first 17 years there. His first language was [[Mandarin Chinese]], spoken in the Suzhou dialect.<ref name=":5"/>

Upon emigrating to the United States to complete his education, he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Central Methodist University]] in 1940 and a [[PhD]] in [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1945.<ref name=":0" /><ref>Smith, Huston; ''Why Religion Matters'', Harper-Collins: San Francisco, 2001.</ref>

While at Chicago, he married Eleanor Wieman, the daughter of [[Henry Nelson Wieman]], a professor at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]].<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uudb.org/articles/henrynelsonwieman.html|title=Henry Nelson Wieman|website=uudb.org|access-date=2019-03-15|archive-date=2019-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803212005/http://uudb.org/articles/henrynelsonwieman.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> She later changed her name to Kendra.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-huston-smith-20170105-story.html|title=Huston Smith, pioneering teacher of world religions, dies at 97|date=2017-01-05|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> They had three daughters, Karen, Gael, and Kimberly Smith.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hustonsmith.net/|title=Huston Smith Homepage|website=www.hustonsmith.net|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref>

== Academic career ==
Smith taught at the [[University of Denver]] from 1945 to 1947, and then at [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], for the next 10 years.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" />

In 1958, Smith was appointed professor of philosophy at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where he remained until 1973.<ref name=":0" /> While there, he participated in experiments with [[psychedelics]] that professors [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Richard Alpert]] conducted at [[Harvard University]]. In 1964, during a trip to India, Smith stayed in a Gyuto Tibetan Buddhist monastery. During his visit he heard the monks chanting and realized that each individual was producing a chord, composed of a fundamental note and overtones. He returned to record the chanting in 1967 and asked acoustic engineers at MIT to analyze the sound.<ref>{{YouTube|OJ_J4OZQruY|Huston Smith telling story of recording}}</ref> They confirmed the finding, which is an example of [[overtone singing]]. Smith has called this the singular empirical discovery of his career. The recording was released as ''[[Music of Tibet (album)|Music of Tibet]]'' (1967). Royalties from the album continue to support the [[Gyuto Tantric University]].<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/music-of-tibet-r1789407 Allmusic.com listing]</ref><ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102234687 NPR story of recording and MIT analysis]</ref><ref>[http://www.gemstone-av.com/mot.htm Official Website of Recording]</ref> Because of his belief in religion, however, Smith was mistrusted by his colleagues, leading MIT to prohibit him from teaching graduate students.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1I_euLhTP4C&q=Huston+Smith+MIT+philosophy+department&pg=PT12|title=The Huston Smith Reader|last=Smith|first=Huston|date=2012-03-26|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520952355|language=en}}</ref>

In 1973, Smith moved to [[Syracuse University]], where he was Thomas J. Watson Professor of Religion and Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Philosophy until he took emeritus status in 1983.<ref name=":0" /> That year, Smith moved to [[Berkeley, California]], where he remained a visiting professor of religious studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] until his death.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />
In 1997, Smith entered into an agreement with the Syracuse University Archives to donate his papers, resulting in a large collection of published books, articles, reviews, or endorsements.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Donor Profile: Huston Cummings Smith |journal=ACCESS |date=Fall 2010 |volume=9 |issue=2 |page=6 |url=https://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=access |access-date=25 December 2022}}</ref>

==Religious practice==
During his career, Smith studied [[Vedanta]] (studying under Swami Satprakashananda, founder of the [[Vedanta_Society#Vedanta_Society_of_St._Louis|Vedanta Society of St. Louis]]),<ref name="Sawyer 2014 51">{{cite book |last= Sawyer |first= Dana |date= 2014|title= Huston Smith: Wisdom Keeper |publisher= Fons Vital |page= 51|isbn= 978-1891785-290}}</ref> [[Zen Buddhism]] (studying under [[Goto Zuigan]]), and [[Sufism]] of [[Islam]] for more than ten years each.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.harpercollins.com/author/microsite/about.aspx?authorid=9210 |title=Huston Smith: About the Author: HarperCollins Publishers |website=www.harpercollins.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807062053/http://www.harpercollins.com/author/microsite/About.aspx?authorid=9210 |archive-date=2012-08-07}}</ref><ref name="Sawyer 2014 51"/>

As a young man, Smith suddenly turned from traditional Methodist Christianity to [[mysticism]], influenced by the writings of [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Gerald Heard]]. In 1947, before moving from Denver to St. Louis, Smith set out to meet with Heard. Heard responded to Smith's letter, inviting him to his [[Trabuco College]] (later donated as the [[Vedanta_Society_Of_Southern_California,_Ramakrishna_Monastery|Ramakrishna Monastery of the Vedanta Society of Southern California]]) in [[Trabuco Canyon]], Southern California. Heard made arrangements to have Smith meet Huxley. Smith recounts in the 2010 documentary ''Huxley on Huxley'' meeting Huxley at his desert home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://huxleyonhuxley.com/about/synopsis/|title=Huxley on Huxley|access-date=2013-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108065138/http://huxleyonhuxley.com/about/synopsis/|archive-date=2014-11-08|url-status=usurped}}</ref> Smith was told to look up [[Swami Satprakashananda]] of the [[Vedanta_Society#Vedanta_Society_of_St._Louis|Vedanta Society of St. Louis]] once he settled in St. Louis. So began Smith's experimentation with meditation and association with the [[Vedanta_Society|Vedanta Societies]] of the [[Ramakrishna Order]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Sawyer |first= Dana |date= 2014|title= Huston Smith: Wisdom Keeper |publisher= Fons Vital |page= 49|isbn= 978-1891785-290}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geraldheard.com/recollections.htm#A%20Second%20Conversion|title=Description by Smith of meeting Heard|publisher=Geraldheard.com|access-date=2010-11-16|archive-date=2011-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526140908/http://www.geraldheard.com/recollections.htm#A%20Second%20Conversion|url-status=dead}}</ref> Smith developed an interest in the [[Traditionalist School]] formulated by [[René Guénon]], [[Frithjof Schuon]] and [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]].

Due to his connection with Heard and Huxley, Smith went on to meet [[Timothy Leary]], Richard Alpert ([[Ram Dass]]), and others at the [[Center for Personality Research]], where Leary was research professor. The group began experimenting with psychedelics and what Smith later called "empirical metaphysics".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychedelic-library.org/books/ecstatic5.htm|title=The Ecstatic Adventure – Chapter 5|author=Ralph Metzner|date=2005-04-18|publisher=Psychedelic-library.org|access-date=2010-11-16}}</ref> The experience and history of the group are described in Smith's book ''[[Cleansing the Doors of Perception]]''. During this period, Smith was also part of the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]], an attempt to raise spiritual awareness through [[entheogen]]ic plants. However, he gave voice to the contrast between himself and Leary when he reminisced about encountering the exile Tim Leary in Switzerland, years later (early 1970s): “he was still a fugitive from lawful society—kicked out of it as he had been kicked out of West Point, Harvard University, and Zihuatanejo.”<ref>Forte, Robert 1999 ''Timothy Leary: Outside Looking In''. Rochester, VT: Park Street Press. p. 267 ISBN 9780892817863</ref>

During his tenure at Syracuse University, he was informed by leaders of the [[Onondaga tribe]] about the [[Native American religious traditions]] and practices, which resulted in an additional chapter in his book on the world's religions. In 1990 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the use of [[peyote]] as a religious sacrament by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] was not protected under the [[US Constitution]]. Smith took up the cause as a religion scholar. With his help in 1994, Congress passed the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] amendment, providing legislative protection to a religious practice that the Supreme Court had decided lacks constitutional protection.<ref>[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201928.One_Nation_Under_God Review of ''One Nation Under God'']</ref>

Smith was a practicing Christian, with a Vedantic understanding, who credited his faith to his missionary parents who had "instilled in me a Christianity that was able to withstand the dominating secular culture of modernity".<ref>Smith, Huston (2005). ''The Soul of Christianity: Restoring the Great Tradition''. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco. "Acknowledgments" p. 167. {{ISBN|978-0-06-079478-1}}.</ref>

== Public activities ==
[[File:Huston Smith 2004.jpg|thumb|Smith in 2004]]
===Television and film===
While at Washington University, Smith was the host of two National Educational Television series (NET – the forerunner of PBS): ''The Religions of Man'' and ''Search for America''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/author/microsite/About.aspx?authorid=9210 |title=Biography of Smith |publisher=Harpercollins.com |access-date=2010-11-16}}</ref>

In 1996, [[Bill Moyers]] devoted a 5-part PBS special to Smith's life and work, ''The Wisdom of Faith with Huston Smith''. Smith produced three series for public television: ''The Religions of Man'', ''The Search for America'', and (with Arthur Compton) ''Science and Human Responsibility''. His films on Hinduism, Tibetan Buddhism, and Sufism have all won awards at international film festivals.

===Community engagement===
[[File:Brandon Williamscraig Huston Smith 20090705 9262.jpg|thumb|Brandon Williamscraig and Huston Smith in their first community dialogue at Epworth United Methodist Church in Berkeley, CA., in 2009.]]Throughout his career, Smith made himself available to the communities where he resided. Toward the end of his life, while living in Berkeley, California, he participated in the Pacific Coast Theological Society at the Graduate Theological Union. He also attended local churches, including Trinity United Methodist, First Congregational Church, and Epworth United Methodist. On the occasion of publishing ''Tales of Wonder'', in 2009 he co-convened "community conversations" at Epworth, during which he responded to questions about his life and work.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArN46r5tYGU Huston Smith and Brandon Williamscraig July 5, 2009 Introduction]</ref><ref>[http://abcglobal.net/Conversations_with_Huston_Smith ABC - Conversations with Huston Smith]</ref>
