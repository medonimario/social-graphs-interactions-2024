'''Heraclitus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɛr|ə|ˈ|k|l|aɪ|t|ə|s|}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Ἡράκλειτος|Ἡράκλειτος]]}} {{transliteration|grc|Hērákleitos}}; {{floruit|{{circa|500&nbsp;BC}}}}) was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosopher from the city of [[Ephesus]], which was then part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].  He exerts a wide influence on [[Ancient philosophy|ancient]] and [[Modern philosophy|modern]] [[Western philosophy]], including through the works of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]].

Little is known of Heraclitus's life. He wrote a single work, only [[Literary fragment|fragments]] of which have survived, catalogued under philosopher number 22 in the [[Diels–Kranz numbering]] system.  Already in antiquity, his [[paradox]]ical philosophy, appreciation for [[Word play|wordplay]], and cryptic, oracular [[epigram]]s earned him the epithets "the dark" and "the obscure". He was considered arrogant and depressed, a [[Misanthropy|misanthrope]] who was subject to [[melancholia]]. Consequently, he became known as "the weeping philosopher" in contrast to the ancient philosopher [[Democritus]], who was known as "the laughing philosopher".

The central ideas of Heraclitus's philosophy are the [[unity of opposites]] and the concept of [[impermanence|change]]. He also saw [[Harmonia|harmony]] and [[Dike (mythology)|justice]] in [[Eris (mythology)|strife]]. He viewed the world as constantly in flux, always "becoming" but never "being". He expressed this in sayings like "Everything [[Fluid dynamics|flows]]" ({{Langx|el|πάντα ρει|translit=}}, ''panta rhei'') and "No man ever steps in the same river twice". This insistence upon change contrasts with that of the ancient philosopher [[Parmenides]], who believed in a reality of static "[[being]]".

Heraclitus believed [[fire]] was the ''[[arche]]'', the fundamental stuff of the world. In choosing an ''arche'' Heraclitus followed the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Milesians]] before him –&nbsp;[[Thales of Miletus|Thales]] with [[water]], [[Anaximander]] with ''[[apeiron]]''  (<small>lit. </small>boundless or infinite), and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] with [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]]. Heraclitus also thought the ''[[logos]]'' (<small>[[Literal translation|lit.]] </small>word, discourse, or reason) gave structure to the world.

==Life==
[[File:Efes Antik Kenti Tiyatrosu.jpg|thumb|Theater in [[Ephesus]] on the coast of [[Asia Minor]], birthplace of Heraclitus]]
Heraclitus, the son of Blyson, was from the [[Ionians|Ionian]] city of Ephesus, a [[port]] on the [[Küçük Menderes River|Cayster River]], on the western coast of [[Asia Minor]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). In the 6th century BC, Ephesus, like other cities in [[Ionia]], lived under the effects of both the rise of [[Lydia]] under [[Croesus]] and his overthrow by [[Cyrus the Great]] c. 547 BC.{{sfn|Kahn|1979|p=1-3}} Ephesus appears to have subsequently cultivated a close relationship with the Persian Empire; during the suppression of the [[Ionian revolt]] by [[Darius the Great]] in 494 BC, Ephesus was spared and emerged as the dominant [[Greeks|Greek]] city in Ionia.{{sfn|Kahn|1979|p=1-3}} [[Miletus]], the home to the previous philosophers, was captured and sacked.<ref>Ionian Revolt, Blackwell Encyclopedia of Ancient Battles (2011)</ref>

The main source for the life of Heraclitus is the [[doxographer]] [[Diogenes Laërtius]].{{efn|name=DiogLae}} Although most of the information provided by Laertius is unreliable, and the ancient stories about Heraclitus are thought to be later fabrications based on interpretations of the preserved fragments; the anecdote that Heraclitus relinquished the hereditary title of "king" to his younger brother may at least imply that Heraclitus was from an [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] family in Ephesus.{{sfn|Kahn|1979|p=1-3}}{{NoteTag|It may also be an unwarranted interpretation of the fragment from Heraclitus stating "the kingdom is a child's".{{sfn|Stokes|1961|page=477}}{{efn|name=Hippolyt52|{{harvnb|Hippolytus|loc= B52}}}} A similar story relates that Heraclitus persuaded the tyrant Melancomas to abdicate.{{sfn|Kirk|1954|p=13}}{{efn|{{harvnb|A3}}}}}} Heraclitus appears to have had little sympathy for [[democracy]] or [[commoner|the masses]].{{efn|{{harvnb|Clement, ''Stromateis''|loc= B29}}}}{{efn|{{harvnb| B49}}}} However, it is unclear whether he was "an unconditional partisan of the rich", or if, like the [[Seven Sages of Greece|sage]] [[Solon]], he was "withdrawn from competing factions".{{sfn|Kahn|1979|p=1-3}}

Since antiquity, Heraclitus has been labeled a solitary figure and an arrogant misanthrope.{{sfn|Wheelwright|1959|p=11, 84}}{{efn|name=DiogLae}} The [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptic]] [[Timon of Phlius]] called Heraclitus a "mob-abuser" (''ochloloidoros'').{{efn|name=DiogLae}} Heraclitus considered himself self-taught.{{efn|name=B101|{{harvnb| B101}}}} He criticized fools for being "put in a flutter by every word".{{efn|{{harvnb|B87}}}} He did not consider others incapable, but unwilling: "And though reason is common, most people live as though they had an understanding peculiar to themselves."{{Efn| name=sextb2|{{harvnb|Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians''|loc=B2}}}} Heraclitus did not seem to like the prevailing religion of the time, criticizing the popular [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cults]], [[Sacrifice|blood sacrifice]], and [[prayer]] to statues.{{sfn|Mikalson|2010|p=96}}{{Efn|name=unholy|{{harvnb|B5}}}}{{efn|name=myste}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Clement, ''Protrepticus''|loc=B15}}}}{{NoteTag|This condemnation of blood sacrifice led some to conclude Heraclitus was a [[vegetarian]].<ref name=kindst/>{{sfn|Kirk|1954|p=5}}}} He also did not believe in [[Funeral|funeral rites]], saying "Corpses are more fit to be cast out than dung."<ref>Saxonhouse, A. W. (1995). Fear of Diversity: The Birth of Political Science in Ancient Greek Thought. United Kingdom: University of Chicago Press. p. 35</ref>{{efn|{{harvnb|B96}}}} He further criticized [[Homer]],{{efn|{{harvnb|Diogenes Laërtius|loc= B42}}}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Diogenes Laërtius|loc= B56}}}} [[Hesiod]],{{efn|{{harvnb|Diogenes Laërtius|loc= B57}}}} [[Pythagoras]],{{efn|{{harvnb|B81}}}} [[Xenophanes]], and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]].{{efn|name=DiogLae}}{{efn|name=DiogL40|{{harvnb|Diogenes Laërtius|loc= B40}}}} He endorsed the sage [[Bias of Priene]], who is quoted as saying "Most men are bad".{{efn|{{harvnb| B39}}}} He praised a man named Hermodorus as the best among the Ephesians, who he says should all [[Suicide|kill themselves]] for exiling him.{{efn|{{harvnb|A2}}}}{{efn|{{harvnb| B121}}}}{{Notetag|Hermodorus may have given some laws to the Romans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0104:entry=hermodorus-bio-1|via=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|title=Hermodo'rus|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>}}

Heraclitus is traditionally considered to have [[Floruit|flourished]] in the 69th [[Olympiad]] (504–501 BC),{{sfn|Burnet|1892|p=130}}{{efn|name=DiogLae|{{harvnb| A1}}}} but this date may simply be based on a prior account synchronizing his life with the reign of [[Darius the Great]].{{sfn|Kahn|1979|p=1-3}}{{Notetag|Two alleged letters between Heraclitus and Darius, quoted by Diogenes Laërtius, are later forgeries.{{sfn|Kirk|1954|p=1}}}} However, this date can be considered "roughly accurate" based on a fragment that references Pythagoras, Xenophanes, and Hecataeus as older contemporaries, placing him near the end of the sixth century BC.{{sfn|Kahn|1979|p=1-3}}{{sfn|Naddaf|2005|p=125}}<ref>Clement, ''Stromateis'', 1.129</ref>
According to Diogenes Laertius, Heraclitus died covered in dung after failing to cure himself from [[Edema|dropsy]]. This may be to parody his doctrine that for souls it is death to become water, and that a dry soul is best.<ref>Fairweather, Janet. "The Death of Heraclitus."

==''On Nature''==
[[File:Miniaturk 009.jpg|thumb|A modern reconstruction of the Ephesian [[Temple of Artemis]], located in modern Istanbul. According to Diogenes Laertius, Heraclitus deposited his book in the temple.]]
Heraclitus is said to have produced a single work on [[papyrus]],{{efn|name=DiogLae}} which has not survived{{West|1971|p=111}}; however, over 100 fragments of this work survive in quotations by other authors.{{NoteTag|Some classicists and professors of ancient philosophy have disputed which of these fragments can truly be attributed to Heraclitus.{{sfn|McCabe|2015}}{{sfn|Kahn|1979|p=168}}}} The title is unknown,{{sfn|Burnet|1892|p=133}} but many later writers refer to this work, and works by other pre-Socratics, as ''On Nature''.{{sfn|Patrick|1889}}{{sfn|KirkRaven|1957|pages=183-184}}{{efn|name=DiogLae}}

According to Diogenes Laërtius, Heraclitus deposited the book in the [[Temple of Artemis|Artemision]] – one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] –&nbsp;as a dedication.{{efn|name=DiogLae}} Classicist [[Charles H. Kahn|Charles Kahn]] states: "Down to the time of [[Plutarch]] and [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], if not later, the little book of Heraclitus was available in its original form to any reader who chose to seek it out."{{sfn|Kahn|1979|p=5}} Yet, by the time of [[Simplicius of Cilicia]], a 6th-century [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] philosopher, who mentions Heraclitus 32 times but never quotes from him, Heraclitus's work was so rare that it was unavailable even to Simplicius and the other scholars at the Platonic Academy in Athens.{{sfn|Mansfield|1999|p=39}}

=== Structure ===
Diogenes Laërtius wrote that the book was divided into three parts: the [[universe]], [[politics]], and [[theology]],{{efn|name=DiogLae}} but, classicists have challenged that division. Classicist [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] has argued that "it is not to be supposed that this division is due to [Heraclitus] himself; all we can infer is that the work fell naturally into these parts when the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] commentators took their editions of it in hand".{{sfn|Burnet|1892|p=132}} The Stoics divided their own philosophy into three parts: ethics, logic, and physics.<ref>see Laertius, 7.33</ref> The Stoic [[Cleanthes]] further divided philosophy into [[dialectic]]s, [[rhetoric]], [[ethics]], politics, [[physics]], and theology, and [[Philology|philologist]] [[Karl Deichgräber]] has argued the last three are the same as the alleged division of Heraclitus.<ref name=kyon>[https://books.google.com/books?id=JL-cyJ6zdJwC&pg=PA51 The Cynics] by. Robert Brach Branham p .51</ref> The philosopher Paul Schuster has argued the division came from the ''[[Pinakes]]''.{{sfn|Finkelberg|2017|p= 31}}{{sfn|Schuster|1873|p=55-56}}

Scholar [[Martin Litchfield West]] claims that while the existing fragments do not give much of an idea of the overall structure,{{sfn|West|1971|p=113-117}} the beginning of the discourse can probably be determined,{{NoteTag|West suggests that the beginning may be tentatively ordered as follows:{{sfn|West|1971|p=113-117}} B1; B114; B2; B89; B30; B31; B90; B60.}} starting with the opening lines, which are quoted by [[Sextus Empiricus]]:

{{blockquote|Of the ''logos'' being forever do men prove to be uncomprehending, both before they hear and once they have heard it. For although all things happen according to this ''logos'' they are like the unexperienced experiencing words and deeds such as I explain when I distinguish each thing according to its nature and declare how it is. Other men are unaware of what they do when they are awake just as they are forgetful of what they do when they are asleep.{{efn|{{harvnb|Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'' |loc=B1}}}} }}

=== Style ===
[[Image:Sibyl Domenichino.jpg|thumb|upright| Heraclitus's writing style has been compared to a [[sibyl]], as depicted here by Domenichino.]]

Heraclitus's style has been compared to a [[Sibyl]],{{sfn|Stokes|1961|p=477}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1qXOcPy-dYC&pg=PA100|title=The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry|first1=Jan|last1=Kwapisz|first2=David|last2=Petrain|first3=Mikolaj|last3=Szymanski|date=December 6, 2012|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-027061-7 |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=":11">Nietzsche, Friedrich.

==== The Obscure ====
[[Aristotle]] quotes part of the opening line of Heraclitus's work in the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' to outline the difficulty in punctuating Heraclitus without ambiguity; he debated whether "forever" applied to "being" or to "prove".{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§2}}{{efn|{{harvnb| A4}}}} Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum (classical)|lyceum]] [[Theophrastus]] says about Heraclitus that "some parts of his work [are] half-finished, while other parts [made] a strange medley".{{efn|name=DiogLae}} Theophrastus thought an inability to finish the work showed Heraclitus was melancholic.{{efn|name=DiogLae}}

Diogenes Laërtius relays the story that the playwright [[Euripides]] gave [[Socrates]] a copy of Heraclitus's work and asked for his opinion. Socrates replied: "The part I understand is excellent, and so too is, I dare say, the part I do not understand; but it needs a [[Delos|Delian]] [[Underwater diving|diver]] to get to the bottom of it."<ref>Laërtius 2.5</ref>

Also according to Diogenes Laërtius, Timon of Phlius called Heraclitus "the Riddler" ({{lang|grc|αἰνικτής}}; {{transliteration|grc|ainiktēs}}) a likely reference to an alleged similarity to Pythagorean riddles.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8YiHqT6CWnUC&pg=PA193 Heresiography in Context] by Jaap Mansfeld p. 193</ref> Timon said Heraclitus wrote his book "rather unclearly" ({{lang|grc|ασαφεστερον}}; {{transliteration|grc|asaphesteron}}); according to Timon, this was intended to allow only the "capable" to attempt it.{{efn|name=DiogLae}} By the time of [[Cicero]], this epithet became in Greek "The Dark" ({{lang|grc|ὁ Σκοτεινός}}; {{transliteration|grc|ho Skoteinós}}) or in [[Latin]] "The Obscure" as he had spoken ''nimis obscurē'' ("too obscurely") concerning nature and had done so deliberately in order to be misunderstood.<ref>Cicero, ''De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum'', Chapter 2, Section 15.</ref>{{sfn|Wheelwright|1959|p=116}} The obscurity was "probably with the idea that it is for us to seek within ourselves, as he sought for himself and found".<ref>Plotinus, Enneads, IV, 8th Tractate</ref>{{efn|name=B101}}

Heraclitus seemed to pattern his obscurity after [[oracle]]s.{{sfn|Finkelberg|2017|p=36}} Heraclitus did state "nature loves to hide"{{efn|{{harvnb|B123}}}} and "a hidden connection is stronger than an obvious one".{{efn|{{harvnb|Hippolytus|loc=B54}}}} He also stated "The lord whose [[Pythia|oracle]] is in [[Delphi]] neither speaks nor conceals, but gives a sign."<ref>The Cambridge Companion to Archaic Greece. (2007). United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press. p. 183</ref>{{efn|{{harvnb|Plutarch, ''On the Pythian Oracle''|loc=B93}}}}  Heraclitus is the earliest known literary reference to the [[Delphic maxims|Delphic maxim]] to [[know thyself]].<ref name=robb>{{cite journal |last=Robb |first=Kevin |date=July 1986 |title='Psyche' and 'Logos' in the Fragments of Heraclitus: The Origins of the Concept of Soul |journal=The Monist |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=315–351 |doi=10.5840/monist198669320 |jstor=27902979}}</ref>{{efn|{{harvnb|Stobaeus|loc=B116}}}}

==Philosophy==
Heraclitus has been the subject of numerous interpretations. According to scholar Daniel W. Graham, Heraclitus has been seen as a "[[Material monism|material monist]] or a [[Process philosophy|process philosopher]]; a scientific [[cosmologist]], a [[Metaphysics|metaphysician]] and a religious thinker; an [[empiricism|empiricist]], a [[rationalism|rationalist]], a [[mysticism|mystic]]; a conventional thinker and a revolutionary; a developer of [[logic]] –&nbsp;one who denied the [[law of non-contradiction]]; the first genuine philosopher and an [[Anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]] [[Obscurantism|obscurantist]]".{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§1}}

=== Unity of opposites and flux ===
The hallmarks of Heraclitus's philosophy are the [[Unity of opposites|unity]] of [[Opposite (semantics)|opposites]] and change, or [[Impermanence|flux]].{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§3.1, 3.2}}{{sfn|Stokes|1961|page=478}} According to Aristotle, Heraclitus was a [[Dialetheism|dialetheist]], or one who denies the [[law of noncontradiction]] (a [[law of thought]] or logical principle which states that something cannot be true and false at the same time).<ref>Vieira, Celso. "Heraclitus, Change and Objective Contradictions in Aristotle's Metaphysics Γ" Rhizomata, vol. 10, no. 2, 2022, pp. 183-214. https://doi.org/10.1515/rhiz-2022-0012</ref><ref name=dliar/>{{efn|name=aris|{{harvnb| A7}}}} Also according to Aristotle, Heraclitus was a [[Materialism|materialist]].<ref name="metaxii">Aristotle. "M". ''Metaphysics'' 1078b</ref> Attempting to follow Aristotle's [[Hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] interpretation, scholar [[W. K. C. Guthrie]] interprets the distinction between flux and stability as one between [[matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]]. On this view, Heraclitus is a flux theorist because he is a materialist who believes matter always changes.<ref name=":1" /> There are no unchanging forms like with Plato or Aristotle. As one author puts it, "Plato took flux as the greatest warning against materialism".<ref>Zhang, J. (2011). One and Many: A Comparative Study of Plato's Philosophy and Daoism Represented by Ge Hong. Germany: University of Hawaii Press. p. 38</ref>

Several fragments seem to relate to the unity of opposites.{{sfn|Stokes|1961|p=478}} For example: "The straight and the crooked path of the [[Fulling|fuller]]'s comb is one and the same";{{efn|{{harvnb|Hippolytus|loc= B59}}}} "The way up is the way down";{{efn|name=Hippolyt60|{{harvnb|Hippolytus|loc= B60}}}} "Beginning and end, on a [[circle]]'s circumference, are common";{{efn|{{harvnb| B103}}}} and "Thou shouldst unite things whole and things not whole, that which tends to unite and that which tends to separate, the harmonious and the discordant; from all things arises the one, and from the one all things."{{Efn|{{harvnb|Pseudo-Aristotle, ''De Mundo''|loc=B10}}}}

Over time, the opposites change into each other:{{sfn|Graham|1997|page=9}}{{sfn|Graham|2008|p=175}} "Mortals are immortals and immortals are mortals, the one living the others' death and dying the others' life";{{efn|{{harvnb|Hippolytus|loc= B62}}}} "As the same thing in us is living and dead, waking and sleeping, young and old. For these things having changed around are those, and those in turn having changed around are these";{{efn|{{harvnb| B88}}}} and "Cold things warm up, the hot cools off, wet becomes dry, dry becomes wet."{{efn|{{harvnb| B126}}}}

It also seems they change into each other depending on one's [[Point of view (philosophy)|point of view]], a case of [[relativism]] or [[perspectivism]].{{sfn|Graham|1997|page=10}}<ref>Nakamura, H. (1992). A Comparative History of Ideas. India: Motilal Banarsidass. p. 170</ref> Heraclitus states: "Disease makes health sweet and good; hunger, satiety; toil, rest."{{efn|{{harvnb|Stobaeus|loc= B111}}}} While men drink and wash with water, [[fish]] prefer to drink saltwater, [[pig]]s prefer to wash in mud, and [[fowl]]s prefer to wash in dust.{{efn|{{harvnb|B13}}}}{{efn|{{harvnb|B37}}}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Hippolytus|loc= B61}}}} "[[Ox]]en are happy when they find bitter [[Vicia|vetches]] to eat"{{Efn|{{harvnb|B4}}}} and "[[Donkey|asses]] would rather have refuse than [[gold]]."{{Efn|{{harvnb|Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics''|loc=B9}}}}

==== ''Panta rhei'' ====
Diogenes Laërtius summarizes Heraclitus's philosophy as follows: "All things come into being by conflict of opposites, and the sum of things ({{lang|grc|τὰ ὅλα}} ''ta hola'' ('the whole')) flows like a stream."{{efn|name=DiogLae}} Classicist [[Jonathan Barnes]] states that "'''''Panta rhei'''''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, 'everything flows' is probably the most familiar of Heraclitus's sayings, yet few modern scholars think he said it".{{sfn|Barnes|1982|p=49}} Barnes observes that although the ''exact'' phrase was not ascribed to Heraclitus until the 6th century by [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], a similar saying expressing the same idea,{{sfn|Barnes|1982|p=49}} ''panta chorei'', or "everything moves" is ascribed to Heraclitus by Plato in the ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]''.{{efn|name=plato1}}

==== You cannot step into the same river twice ====
[[File:Kızılırmak River from Kapıkaya Köyü.jpg|thumb|The [[Halys River]], Turkey's longest. Heraclitus's theory of flux has been associated with the metaphor of a flowing river.]]
Since Plato, Heraclitus's theory of flux has been associated with the metaphor of a flowing river, which cannot be stepped into twice.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§3.1}}{{efn|name=plato1|{{harvnb| A6}}}} This fragment from Heraclitus's writings has survived in three different forms:{{sfn|Barnes|1982|p=49}}

*"On those who step into the same rivers, different and different waters flow" — [[Arius Didymus]], quoted in [[Stobaeus]] {{efn|{{harvnb| B12}}}}
*"We both step and do not step into the same river, we both are and are not" — [[Heraclitus (commentator)|Heraclitus Homericus]], ''Homeric Allegories'' {{efn|{{harvnb| B49a}}}}
*"It is not possible to step into the same river twice" — [[Plutarch]], ''On the E at Delphi'' {{efn|{{harvnb|Plutarch, On the E at Delphi|loc= B91}}}}

The classicist [[Karl Reinhardt (philologist)|Karl Reinhardt]] identified the first river quote as the genuine one.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§3}}  The river fragments (especially the second "we both are and are not") seem to suggest not only is the river constantly changing, but we do as well, perhaps commenting on [[Existentialism|existential]] questions about humanity and personhood.{{sfn|Warren|2014|pp=72-74}}

Scholars such as Reinhardt also interpreted the metaphor as illustrating what is stable, rather than the usual interpretation of illustrating change.<ref>Parmenides, 206-207</ref> Classicist {{Ill|Karl-Martin Dietz|de}} has said: "You will not find anything, in which the river remains constant&nbsp;... Just the fact, that there is a particular river bed, that there is a source and an estuary etc. is something, that stays identical. And this is&nbsp;... the concept of a river."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Heraklit von Ephesus und die Entwicklung der Individualität|last=Dietz|first=Karl-Martin|publisher=Verlag Freies Geistesleben|year=2004|isbn=978-3772512735|location=Stuttgart|pages=60}}</ref> According to American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]], the river parable illustrates that the river is a process through time. One cannot step twice into the same river-stage.<ref>Quine, W. V. (1950). ''Identity, Ostension, and Hypostasis. The Journal of Philosophy, 47(22), 621.'' {{doi|10.2307/2021795}}</ref>

Professor [[M. M. McCabe]] has argued that the three statements on rivers should all be read as fragments from a discourse. McCabe suggests reading them as though they arose in succession. The three fragments "could be retained, and arranged in an argumentative sequence".{{sfn|McCabe|2015}} In McCabe's reading of the fragments, Heraclitus can be read as a philosopher capable of sustained [[argument]], rather than just [[aphorism]].{{sfn|McCabe|2015}}

==== Strife is justice ====
[[File:AstraeaVSH.JPG|thumb|[[Dike (mythology)|Dike]] depicted on the [[Vermont]] state house. Heraclitus considered strife fundamental to a just world.]]

Heraclitus said "strife is justice"{{efn|{{harvnb|Origen|loc= B80}}}} and "all things take place by strife".{{efn|name=ArisB8|{{harvnb|Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics''|loc=B8}}}} He called the opposites in conflict {{lang|grc|ἔρις}} ({{transliteration|grc|eris}}), "[[Eris (mythology)|strife]]", and theorized that the apparently unitary state, {{lang|grc|δίκη}} ({{transliteration|grc|dikê}}), "[[Dike (mythology)|justice]]", results in "the most beautiful [[Harmonia (mythology)|harmony]]",{{efn|name=ArisB8}} in contrast to [[Anaximander]], who described the same as injustice.<ref name=":11" />{{sfn|Guthrie|1962|p=46}}<ref>Michael Gagarin (1974). Dike in Archaic Greek Thought. Classical Philology, 69(3), 186–197. {{doi|10.2307/268491}}</ref>

Aristotle said Heraclitus disagreed with Homer because Homer wished that strife would leave the world, which according to Heraclitus would destroy the world; "there would be no harmony without high and low notes, and no animals without male and female, which are opposites".{{efn|{{harvnb| A22}}}} It may also explain why he disagreed with the Pythagorean emphasis on harmony, but not on strife.<ref name=":1">W. K. C. Guthrie "Pre-Socratic Philosophy" ''Cambridge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1961) p. 443</ref>

Heraclitus suggests that the world and its various parts are kept together through the [[Tension (physics)|tension]] produced by the unity of opposites, like the string of a [[Bow and arrow|bow]] or a [[lyre]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4182189|last=Snyder|first=Jane McIntosh|title=The Harmonia of Bow and Lyre in Heraclitus Fr. 51 (DK)|journal=Phronesis|volume= 29|number= 1|year=1984|pages= 91–95|doi=10.1163/156852884X00201 |jstor=4182189 |via=jstor|accessdate=June 9, 2023}}</ref>{{efn|{{harvnb|Hippolytus|loc= B51}}}} On one account, this is the earliest use of the concept of [[force]].<ref name=":12">Cambridge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Force, by M. Jammer (1961)</ref> A quote about the bow shows his appreciation for wordplay: "The bow's name is life, but its work is death."{{efn|{{harvnb| B48}}}}{{NoteTag|[[wikt:βιός|Biós]] with the accent on the O, is the Greek for "bow". [[wikt:βίος|Bίοs]] with the accent on the I, is the Greek for "life".}} Each substance contains its opposite, making for a continual circular exchange of generation, destruction, and motion that results in the stability of the world.{{sfn|Sandywell|1996|p=263-265}}{{sfn|Graham|2008|p=175-177}} This can be illustrated by the quote "Even the ''[[kykeon]]'' separates if it is not stirred."{{efn|{{harvnb| B125}}}}

According to Abraham Schoener: "War is the central principle in Heraclitus' thought."<ref>Schoener, Abraham (1993). Heraclitus on War. Dissertation, University of Toronto (Canada)</ref> Another of Heraclitus's famous sayings highlights the idea that the unity of opposites is also a conflict of opposites: "War is father of all and king of all; and some he manifested as gods, some as men; some he made slaves, some free";{{efn|{{harvnb|Hippolytus|loc= B53}}}} war is a creative tension that brings things into existence.{{sfn|Sandywell|1996|p=263-265}}{{sfn|Curd|2020|loc= Xenophanes of Colophon and Heraclitus of Ephesus}} Heraclitus says further "Gods and men honour those slain in war";{{efn|{{harvnb|Clement, ''Stromateis''|loc=B24}}}} "Greater deaths gain greater portions";{{efn|{{harvnb|Clement, ''Stromateis''|loc=B25}}}} and "Every beast is tended by blows."{{efn|{{harvnb|Pseudo-Aristotle, ''De Mundo''|loc=B11}}}}

=== ''Logos'' ===
[[File:Logos.svg|thumb|[[Greek alphabet|Greek spelling]] of ''logos'']]
A core concept for Heraclitus is ''[[logos]]'', an ancient Greek word literally meaning "word, speech, discourse, or [[Meaning (philosophy)|meaning]]". For Heraclitus, the ''logos'' seems to designate the rational structure or ordered composition of the world.<ref name=":8">Hoffman, David. (2006). Structural Logos in Heraclitus and the Sophists. Advances in the History of Rhetoric. 9. 1-32. 10.1080/15362426.2006.10557259.</ref>{{sfn|Kahn|1979|p=98}} As well as the opening quote of his book, one fragment reads: "Listening not to me but to the ''logos'', it is wise to agree (''homologein'') that all things are one."{{efn|name=Hippolyt50|{{harvnb|Hippolytus|loc= B50}}}} Another fragment reads: "[''[[hoi polloi]]''] ... do not know how to listen [to ''Logos''] or how to speak [the truth]."{{sfnm|1a1=Warren|1y=2014|1p=63|2a1=Sandywell|2y=1996|2p=237}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Clement, ''Stromateis''|loc= B19}}}}

The word ''logos'' has a wide variety of other uses, such that Heraclitus might have a different meaning of the word for each usage in his book. Kahn has argued that Heraclitus used the word in multiple senses,{{sfn|Kahn|1979|page=94}} whereas Guthrie has argued that there is no evidence Heraclitus used it in a way that was significantly different from that in which it was used by contemporaneous speakers of Greek.{{sfn|Guthrie|1962|p=419}}

Professor [[Michael Stokes (academic)|Michael Stokes]] interprets Heraclitus's use of ''logos'' as a public [[fact]] like a [[proposition]] or [[formula]]; like Guthrie, he views Heraclitus as a materialist, so he grants Heraclitus would not have considered these as [[Abstract object theory|abstract objects]] or [[Incorporeality|immaterial]] things.{{sfn|Guthrie|1962|p=46}}{{sfn|Stokes|1961|p=477-8}} Another possibility is the ''logos'' referred to the [[truth]], or to the book itself.<ref>[[Olof Gigon]], Untersuchungen Zu Heraklit, p.4</ref>{{sfn|Kirk|1954|p=37}}{{sfn|Patrick|1889|page=23}} Classicist [[Walther Kranz]] translated it as "[[Intension|sense]]".{{sfn|Kirk|1954|p=37}}

Heraclitus's ''logos'' doctrine may also be the origin of the doctrine of [[natural law]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2707978 | jstor=2707978 | title=Herakleitos and the Law of Nature | last1=Singh | first1=Raghuveer | journal=Journal of the History of Ideas | date=1963 | volume=24 | issue=4 | pages=457–472 }}</ref>{{sfn|Stokes|1961|p=480}} Heraclitus stated "People ought to fight to keep their law as to defend the city walls. For all human laws get nourishment from the one divine law."{{efn|name=stob114|{{harvnb|Stobaeus|loc=B114}}}} "Far from arguing like the latter Sophists, that the human law, because it is a conventional law, deserves to be abandoned in favor of the law of nature, Herakleitos argued that the human law partakes of the law of nature, which is at the same time a divine law."<ref>R. D. Ranade, 'Herakleitos' in Philosophical and Other Essays (Jamkhandi, 1956), 19-22.</ref>

=== Fire ===
{{See also|Classical element#Hellenistic philosophy}}
[[File:DancingFlames.jpg|thumb|220px|Heraclitus believed the cosmos "no god nor man did create, but it ever was and is and will be: ever-living fire".]]
The Milesians before Heraclitus had a view called [[material monism]] which conceived of certain elements as the ''arche'' – Thales with water, Anaximander with ''apeiron'', and Anaximenes with air. Since antiquity, philosophers have concluded that Heraclitus construed of fire as the ''arche'', the ultimate reality or the fundamental element that gave rise to the other elements.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§3.3}}{{efn|{{harvnb| A5}}}}{{efn|name=aetA8|{{harvnb| A8}}}} Pre-Socratic scholar [[Eduard Zeller]] has argued that Heraclitus believed that heat in general and dry exhalation in particular, rather than visible fire, was the ''arche''.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1979|page=147}}</ref>

In one fragment, Heraclitus writes:

{{blockquote|This world-order (''[[Cosmos|kosmos]]''), the same for all, no god nor man did create, but it ever was and is and will be: ever-living fire, kindling in measures and being quenched in measures.{{efn|{{harvnb|Clement, ''Stromateis''|loc= B30}}}}}}

This is the oldest extant quote using ''kosmos'', or order, to mean the world.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§4}}{{sfn|Vlastos|2022|p=134}} Heraclitus seems to say fire is the one thing eternal in the universe.{{sfn|Graham|2008|pp=170-172}} From fire all things originate and all things return again in a process of never-ending cycles.{{sfn|Graham|2008|pp=170-172}}  Plato and Aristotle attribute to Heraclitus a periodic destruction of the world by a great conflagration, known as ''ekpyrosis,'' which happens every [[Great Year]] – according to Plato, every 36,000 years.<ref name=ekpyro>Mondolfo, Rodolfo, and D. J. Allan. "Evidence of Plato and Aristotle Relating to the Ekpyrosis in Heraclitus." Phronesis, vol. 3, no. 2, 1958, pp. 75–82. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/4181631. Accessed 30 May 2024.</ref>

Heraclitus more than once describes the transformations to and from fire:

{{blockquote|Fire lives the death of earth, and air lives the death of fire; water lives the death of air, and earth that of water.{{efn|name=Aurel76|{{harvnb|Aurelius|loc= B76}}}}}}
{{blockquote|The turnings of fire: first sea, and of sea half is earth, half fireburst. [Earth] is liquefied as sea and measured into the same proportion as it had before it became earth.{{Efn|{{harvnb|Clement, ''Stromateis''|loc=B31}}}}}}

====Fire as symbolic====
However, it is also argued by many that Heraclitus never identified fire as the ''arche''; rather, he only used fire to explain his notion of flux, as the basic stuff which changes or moves the most.{{sfn|West|1971|p=172-173}} Others conclude he used it as the physical form of ''logos''.{{sfn|Stokes|1961|page=477-478}}

On yet another interpretation, Heraclitus is not a material monist explicating flux nor stability, but a revolutionary [[Process philosophy|process philosopher]] who chooses fire in an attempt to say there is no ''arche''. Fire is a symbol or metaphor for change, rather than the basic stuff which changes the most.{{sfn|Graham|1997|page=37}} Perspectives of this sort emphasize his statements on change such as "The way up is the way down",{{sfn|Graham|1997|page=40}}{{efn|name=Hippolyt60}} as well as the quote "All things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares",{{efn|{{harvnb|Plutarch, On the E at Delphi|loc= B90}}}} which has been understood as stating that while all can be transformed into fire, not everything comes from fire, just as not everything comes from gold.{{sfn|Graham|1997|page=45}}

=== Cosmology ===
While considered an ancient [[Cosmology|cosmologist]],<ref>Wiggins D. "Heraclitus' conceptions of flux, fire and material persistence." In: Schofield M, Nussbaum MC, eds. ''Language and Logos: Studies in Ancient Greek Philosophy Presented to G. E. L. Owen''. Cambridge University Press; 1982:1-32.</ref> Heraclitus did not seem as interested in [[astronomy]], [[meteorology]], or [[mathematics]] as his predecessors.{{sfn|Patrick|1889|page=40}}{{sfn|Stokes|1961|p=479}} It is surmised Heraclitus believed that the [[Flat Earth|earth was flat]] and extended infinitely in all directions.{{sfn|Patrick|1889|page=32}}

Heraclitus held all things occur according to [[fate]].{{sfn|Kahn|1979|page=157}}{{efn|name=aetA8}} He said "Time (''[[Aion (deity)|Aion]]'') is a child playing [[Checkers|draughts]], the kingly power is a child's."{{efn|name=Hippolyt52}} It is disputed whether this means time and life is determined by [[Norm (philosophy)|rules]] like a [[game]], by conflict like a game, or by arbitrary whims of the gods like a child plays.<ref>Nagel, M. (2002). Masking the Abject: A Genealogy of Play. United Kingdom: Lexington Books. p. 18</ref>

==== Sun ====
Similar to his views on rivers, Heraclitus believed "the [[Sun]] is new each day."{{sfn|BardonDyke2015|p=26}}{{efn|{{harvnb|B6}}}} He also said the Sun never [[Sunset|sets]].<ref>Oudemans, Th C. W. (1992). De nooit ondergaande zon (Summary: The Never Setting Sun), p. 456. Tijdschrift Voor Filosofie 54 (3):424.</ref>{{efn|{{harvnb|B16}}}}  This was "obviously inspired by scientific reflection, and no doubt seemed to him to obviate the difficulty of understanding how the sun can work its way underground from west to east during the night".<ref name=mystic/> The physician [[Galen]] explains: "Heraclitus says that the sun is a burning mass, kindled at its rising, and quenched at its setting."<ref name="ancast">Lewis, G.

Heraclitus also believed that the Sun is as large as it looks,{{sfn|Patrick|1889|page=32}}{{Notetag|Literally, the width of a man's foot.{{efn|name=B3foot|{{harvnb|B3}}}}}} and said Hesiod "did not know [[night]] and [[day]], for they are one."{{efn|{{harvnb|Hippolytus|loc=B57}}}}  However, he also explained the phenomenon of day and night by if the Sun "oversteps his measures", then "[[Erinyes]], the ministers of Justice, will find him out".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KaWGEAAAQBAJ Studies on the Derveni Papyrus] p. 176-8</ref>{{efn|name=exile94|{{harvnb|B94}}}} Heraclitus further wrote the Sun is in charge of [[Season|the seasons]].{{efn|{{harvnb|B100}}}}

==== Moon ====
On one account, Heraclitus believed the Sun and [[Moon]] were [[bowl]]s containing fire, with [[lunar phase]]s explained by the turning of the bowl.{{sfn|Stokes|1961|p=479}}<ref name="ancast" />{{efn|{{harvnb|Aëtius|loc=A12}}}} His study of the moon near the end of the month is contained in one of the [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]], a group of [[manuscript]]s found in an ancient [[landfill]].<ref>Oxyrhynchus Papyri LIII 3710 ii. 43–47 and iii. 7–11</ref> This is the best evidence of Heraclitean astronomy.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§4, 8}}

=== God ===
[[File:Jupiter Smyrna Louvre Ma13.jpg|thumb|140px|Zeus hurls a thunderbolt.]]
Heraclitus said "[[thunderbolt]] steers all things",{{efn|{{harvnb|Hippolytus|loc=B64}}}} a rare comment on meteorology and likely a reference to [[Zeus]] as the supreme being.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§4}} Even his theology proves contradictory: "One being, the only wise one, would and would not be called by the name of Zeus."{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§4}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Clement, ''Stromateis''|loc=B32}}}} He invokes relativism with the divine too: God sees man the same way man sees children and apes;{{sfn|Stokes|1961|p=480}}{{Efn|{{harvnb|B83}}}}{{Efn|{{harvnb|Origen|loc=B79}}}} and he seems to give a [[theodicy]], "for god all things are fair and good and just, but men suppose that some are unjust and others just".{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§4}}{{efn|{{harvnb| B102}}}}

In ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', Aristotle relays this story: "Heraclitus, when the strangers who came to visit him found him warming himself at the furnace in the kitchen and hesitated to go in, reported to have bidden them not to be afraid to enter, as even in that kitchen divinities were present, so we should venture on the study of every kind of animal without distaste; for each and all will reveal to us something natural and something beautiful."<ref>Gregoric, Pavel (2001).

(1680). Mathematical Magick. United Kingdom: E.Gellibrand.</ref>}}

The phrase ἦθος ἀνθρώπῳ δαίμων (''ethos anthropoi daimon'') is attributed to Heraclitus. It is variously translated as "a man's character is his fate", "character is destiny", or perhaps most literally as "a man's character is his guardian divinity."<ref>[https://dspace.ashoka.edu.in/bitstream/123456789/5182/1/9781472598394.pdf Plato's Symposium: A Reader's Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230613060251/https://dspace.ashoka.edu.in/bitstream/123456789/5182/1/9781472598394.pdf |date=2023-06-13 }} by.

=== The Soul ===
Heraclitus believed the [[soul]] (''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'') was complex, stating: "The limits of the soul you could not discover, though traversing every path."<ref>Betegh, Gabor. The Limits of the Soul: Heraclitus B45. Its text and interpretation E. Hülsz (ed.), Nuevos ensayos sobre Heráclito, Mexico City, 2009, 391-414.</ref>{{efn|{{harvnb|Diogenes Laërtius|loc= B45}}}} Heraclitus regarded the soul as a mixture of fire and water, and believed that fire was the noble part of the soul and water the ignoble part.{{efn|name=B36}} He considered mastery of one's worldly desires to be a noble pursuit that purified the soul's fire,{{sfn|Hussey|1999|p=111}} while [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]] damages the soul by causing it to be moist.{{efn|{{harvnb|Stobaeus|loc= B117}}}}{{efn|name=B77}}{{efn|name=drysoul|{{harvnb|Stobaeus|loc= B118}}}} Heraclitus seems to advise against anger: "It is hard to fight with anger, for what it wants it buys at the price of the soul."<ref>MANSFELD, J.

Heraclitus associates being awake with comprehension;<ref name=robb /> as Sextus Empiricus explains "It is by drawing in this divine reason in [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] that we become endowed with [[mind]] and in sleep we become forgetful, but in waking we regain our [[sense]]s.

[[File:A classic circular form spider's web.jpg|thumb|150px|Heraclitus compares the soul to a spider and the body to the web.]]
Heraclitus compares the soul to a [[spider]] and the body to the [[Spider web|web]].{{efn|{{harvnb|B67a}}}} Heraclitus believed the soul is what unifies the body and also what grants linguistic understanding, departing from Homer's conception of it as merely the [[Pneuma|breath of life]].<ref>Martha C.

The Aristotelian tradition is responsible for a great part of the transmission of Heraclitus's physical conception of the soul.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sánchez Castro |first1=Liliana Carolina |url=https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004443358_014 |title=The Aristotelian Reception Of Heraclitus' Conception of the Soul |date=2021 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-44335-8 |pages=377–403 |doi=10.1163/9789004443358_014}}</ref> Aristotle wrote in ''[[On the Soul|De Anima]]'': "Heraclitus too says that the first principle-the 'warm exhalation' of which, according to him, everything else is composed-is soul; further, that this exhalation is most incorporeal and in ceaseless flux".{{efn|{{harvnb| A15}}}}

=== Foreign influence ===
Heraclitus's originality and placement near the beginning of Greek philosophy has resulted in several writers looking for possible influence from the surrounding nations.

==== Persia ====
[[File:Zoroastrian_Fire_Temple,_Yazd_(2).jpg|thumb|upright|280px|An [[eternal flame]] from a Zoroastrian [[fire temple]] in [[Yazd]], [[Iran]]. The role of fire in Heraclitean philosophy has been compared with [[fire worship]] in [[Zoroastrianism]], the state religion of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] during Heraclitus's life.]]
The Persian Empire had a close connection with Ephesus and [[Zoroastrianism]] was the state religion of the Persian Empire. Heraclitus's emphasis on fire has been investigated for influence from Zoroastrian [[fire worship]] and specifically the concept of ''[[Atar]]''.{{sfn|West|1971|p=170-171}} While many of the doctrines of Zoroastrian fire do not match exactly with those of Heraclitus, such as the relation of fire to [[earth (classical element)|earth]], it is still argued he may have taken some inspiration from them.{{sfn|West|1971|p=170-171}} Zoroastrian parallels to Heraclitus are often difficult to identify specifically due to a lack of surviving Zoroastrian literature from the period and mutual influence with Greek philosophy.{{Notetag|The 9th century CE [[Dadestan i Denig]] preserves information on Zoroastrian cosmology, but also shows direct borrowings from Aristotle.{{sfn|West|1971|p=174-175}}}}

==== India ====
The interchange of other elements with fire also has parallels in [[Vedas|Vedic]] literature from the same time period, such as the ''[[Upanishads]]''.{{sfn|West|1971|p=174-175}} The ''[[Taittiriya Upanishad]]'' for instance states "Fire is established in water, water is established in fire".<ref>[https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-taittiriya-upanishad/d/doc79856.html Taittiriya Upanishad] by A. Mahadeva Sastri (1903)</ref> Heraclitus may have also been influenced by a Vedic [[meditation]] known as the "[[Panchagni Vidya|Doctrine of the Five Fires]]."{{sfn|Mcevilley|2012}} West however stresses that these doctrines of the interchange of elements were common throughout written works on philosophy that have survived from that period; so Heraclitus's doctrine of fire can not be definitively said to have been influenced by any other particular Iranian or Indian influence, but may have been part of a mutual interchange of influence over time across the Ancient Near East.{{sfn|West|1971|p=170-176}}

==== Egypt ====
Philosopher [[Gustav Teichmüller]] sought to prove Heraclitus was influenced by the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]],{{sfn|Patrick|1889|page=30-31}}<ref name=":15">{{cite journal|journal=The New Cycle|volume=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rs7AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA33|author=C.

=== Ancient ===

==== Pre-Socratics ====
It is unknown whether or not Heraclitus had any students in his lifetime.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§7}} Diogenes Laertius states Heraclitus's book "won so great a fame that there arose followers of him called Heracliteans."{{efn|name=DiogLae}} Scholars took this to mean Heraclitus had no disciples and became renowned only after his death.{{sfn|Finkelberg|2017|p=24}} According to one author, "The school of disciples founded by Heraclitus flourished for long after his death".{{sfn|Mitchell|1911}} According to another, "there were no doubt other Heracliteans whose names are now lost to us".{{sfn|Bett|2003|page=132}}

In his dialogue ''Cratylus'', Plato presented [[Cratylus]] as a Heraclitean and as a [[Cratylism|linguistic naturalist]] who believed that names must apply naturally to their objects.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dell'Aversana |first=Paolo |date=December 6, 2013 |title=Cognition in Geosciences: The feeding loop between geo-disciplines, cognitive sciences and epistemology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_ReAgAAQBAJ |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=9789073834682 |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Attardo |first=Salvatore |date=2002 |title=Translation and Humour: An Approach Based on the General Theory of Verbal Humour (GTVH) |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13556509.2002.10799131 |journal=The Translator |language=en |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=173–194 |doi=10.1080/13556509.2002.10799131 |issn=1355-6509 |s2cid=142611273}}</ref> According to Aristotle, Cratylus went a step beyond his master's doctrine and said that one cannot step into the same river once. He took the view that nothing can be said about the ever-changing world and "ended by thinking that one need not say anything, and only moved his finger".<ref name=":4">{{cite book | author = [[Aristotle]] | title = [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]] | chapter = Γ | at = 1010a}}</ref> To explain both characterizations by Plato and Aristotle, Cratylus may have thought continuous change warrants skepticism because one cannot define a thing that does not have a permanent nature.<ref>Logic by Wilfrid Hodges, p. 13</ref> Diogenes Laertius also lists an otherwise historically obscure Antisthenes who wrote a commentary on Heraclitus.{{NoteTag|Not to be confused with [[Antisthenes|the cynic]].{{efn|name=DiogLae}}}}

The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and comic writer [[Epicharmus of Kos]] has fragments which seem to reproduce the thought of Heraclitus, and wrote a play titled ''Heraclitus''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Heidel |first=William Arthur |date=1913 |title=On Certain Fragments of the Pre-Socratics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhOCAAAAIAAJ |journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences |issue=48 |pages=709}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DE%3Aentry+group%3D4%3Aentry%3Depicharmus-bio-1|title=Epicharmus|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|via=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology}}</ref>

===== Eleatics =====
[[File:Busto di Parmenide (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Parmenides]], a contemporary who espoused a doctrine of unchanging Being, has been contrasted with Heraclitus and his doctrine of constant change.]]
[[Parmenides]] of Elea, a philosopher and near-contemporary, proposed a doctrine of changelessness, in contrast to the doctrine of flux put forth by Heraclitus.{{sfn|Nehamas|2002}}{{sfn|Graham|2002|pages=27-30}} He is generally agreed to either have influenced or been influenced by Heraclitus.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§7}}{{sfn|Graham|2002|p=27-30}} Different philosophers have argued that either one of them may have substantially influenced each other, some taking Heraclitus to be responding to Parmenides, but more often Parmenides is seen as responding to Heraclitus.{{sfn|Graham|2002|pages=27-30}}<ref>Popper, Karl (2012). The World of Parmenides: Essays on the Presocratic Enlightenment. (n.p.): Taylor & Francis. p. 249</ref> Some also argue that any direct chain of influence between the two is impossible to determine.{{sfn|Graham|2002|p=27-30}} Although Heraclitus refers to older figures such as Pythagoras,{{efn|name=DiogLae}}{{efn|name=DiogL40}} neither Parmenides or Heraclitus refer to each other by name in any surviving fragments, so any speculation on influence must be based on interpretation.{{sfn|Graham|2002|p=27-30}}

===== Pluralists and atomists =====
The surviving fragments of several other pre-Socratic philosophers show Heraclitean themes.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§7}} [[Diogenes of Apollonia]] thought the action of one thing on another meant they were made of one substance.{{sfn|Stokes|1961|p=480}} The [[Pluralist School|pluralists]] may have been influenced by Heraclitus. The philosopher [[Anaxagoras]] refuses to separate the opposites in the "one cosmos".{{sfn|Stokes|1961|p=480}} [[Empedocles]] has forces (arguably the first since Heraclitus's tension)<ref name=":12" /> which are in opposition, known as Love and Hate, or more accurately, Harmony and Strife.{{sfn|Stokes|1961|p=480}} Democritus and the [[Atomism|atomists]] were also influenced by Heraclitus.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§7}} The atomists and Heraclitus both believed that everything was in motion.<ref>Aristotle, Physics Book 8</ref><ref>Early Greek Philosophy. (2013).

R. (1996). Thinking about the earth: a history of ideas in geology. London: Harvard University Press. p. 13</ref>

===== Sophists =====
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato's [[Theory of Forms]] was a result of reconciling Heraclitus and Parmenides.|160px]]The sophists, including [[Protagoras]] of Abdera and [[Gorgias]] of Leontini, may also have been influenced by Heraclitus. Sophists in general seemed to share Heraclitus's conception of the ''logos''.<ref name=":8" /> One tradition associated the sophists' concern with politics and preventing party strife with Heraclitus.<ref name="reread" /><ref>Liberal Temper in Greek Politics, by Eric Havelock, p. 290</ref>

Heraclitus and others used "measure" to mean the balance and order of nature; hence Protagoras' famous statement "man is the measure of all things".<ref>Schiappa, E. (2013). Protagoras and Logos: A Study in Greek Philosophy and Rhetoric. United States: University of South Carolina Press. p. 119</ref> In Plato's [[Socratic dialogue|dialogue]] ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', Socrates sees Protagoras's "man is the measure" doctrine and [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]]' hypothesis that "knowledge is perception" as justified by Heraclitean flux.<ref>Reshotko, Naomi.

Accessed 25 May 2024.</ref>

Gorgias seems to have been influenced by the ''logos'', when he argued in his work ''On Non-Being'', possibly parodying the Eleatics, that being cannot exist or be communicated. According to one author, Gorgias "in a sense ... completes Heraclitus."<ref name="reread">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gqKZ5Or119kC&pg=PA44 Rereading the Sophists by Susan Jarratt] p. 44</ref>

==== Classical and Hellenistic philosophy ====
Plato knew of the teachings of Heraclitus through the Heraclitean philosopher Cratylus.<ref name=":4" /> Plato held that for Heraclitus knowledge is made impossible by the flux of sensible objects, and thus the need for the imperceptible [[Theory of forms|Forms]] as objects of knowledge.<ref name="metaxii" /><ref>Robinson, T.

Aristotle accused Heraclitus of denying the law of noncontradiction, and charges that he thereby failed in his reasoning.{{efn|name=aris}} However, Aristotle's material monist and world conflagration (''ekpyrosis'') interpretation of Heraclitus influenced the Stoics.<ref name=ekpyro/>{{sfn|Stokes|1961|p=480}}{{sfn|Gregory|2008|p=57}}

===== Stoics =====
[[File:Cleanthes from L. Annaei Senecae philosophi Opera, 1605, title page detail.png|thumb|The Stoic Cleanthes wrote a lost, four-volume ''Interpretation of Heraclitus''. (1605 engraving)|200px]]
The Stoics believed major tenets of their philosophy derived from the thought of Heraclitus; especially the ''logos,'' used to support their belief that rational law governs the universe.{{sfn|Long|2001|loc=chapter 2}}{{sfn|Warren|2014|p=63}} Scholar [[A. A. Long]] concludes the earliest Stoic fragments are "modifications of Heraclitus".{{sfn|Long|2001|p=51}} According to philosopher [[Philip Hallie]], "Heraclitus of Ephesus was the father of [[Stoic physics]]."<ref>"Stoicism" by Philip Halle, Cambridge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1961)</ref>

A four-volume work titled ''Interpretation of Heraclitus'' was written by the Stoic philosopher Cleanthes, but has not survived.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§7}}<ref>Diogenes Laertius 7.174</ref>{{efn|name=DiogLae}} In surviving stoic writings, Heraclitean influence is most evident in the writings of [[Marcus Aurelius]].{{sfn|Long|2001|p=56}}  Marcus Aurelius understood the ''Logos'' as "the account which governs everything".<ref>Stephens, W. O. (2012). Marcus Aurelius: A Guide for the Perplexed. United Kingdom: Bloomsbury Publishing. p. 46-48</ref>{{efn|{{harvnb|Aurelius|loc= B72}}}} Heraclitus also states, "We should not act and speak like children of our parents", which Marcus Aurelius interpreted to mean one should not simply accept what others believe.{{sfn|Kahn|1979|p=106}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Aurelius|loc= B74}}}}

Many of the later Stoics interpreted the ''logos'' as the ''arche'', as a creative fire that ran through all things;{{sfn|Goodenough|1923|page=2}} West observes that Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and Sextus Empiricus all make no mention of this doctrine, and concludes that the language and thought are "obviously Stoic" and not attributable to Heraclitus.{{sfn|West|1971|p=124-125}} Burnet cautions that these Stoic modifications of Heraclitus make it harder to interpret Heraclitus himself, as the Stoics ascribed their own interpretations of terms like ''logos'' and ''ekpyrosis'' to Heraclitus.{{sfn|Burnet|1892|pp=142–143}}

===== Cynics =====
The [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] were influenced by Heraclitus, such as by his condemnation of the mystery cults.<ref name=kyon/><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JL-cyJ6zdJwC|title=The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy |first1=Robert Bracht|last1=Branham|first2=Marie-Odile|last2=Goulet-Cazé|date=June 7, 1996|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520204492 |via=Google Books}}</ref>{{efn|name=myste}} Heraclitus is sometimes even depicted as a cynic.

===== Pyrrhonists =====
The skeptical philosophers known as [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonists]] were also influenced by Heraclitus. He may be the predecessor to [[Pyrrho]]'s relativistic doctrine "No More This than That ", that nothing is one way rather than another way.{{sfn|Bett|2003|page=132}} According to Pyrrhonist Sextus Empiricus, [[Aenesidemus]], one of the major ancient Pyrrhonist philosophers, claimed in a now-lost work that Pyrrhonism was a way to Heraclitean philosophy because Pyrrhonist practice helps one to see how opposites appear to be the case about the same thing, leading to the Heraclitean view that opposites actually are true about the same thing.{{sfn|Bett|2003|page=223}}<ref name=":17" /> Sextus Empiricus disagreed, arguing opposites appearing to be the case about the same thing is not a [[dogma]] of the Pyrrhonists but a matter occurring to the Pyrrhonists, to the other philosophers, and to all of humanity.<ref name=":17">[[Sextus Empiricus]] ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' Book I, Chapter 29, Sections 210–211</ref>

==== Early Christianity ====
[[File:John 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|John 1:1 in the page showing the first chapter of [[Gospel of John|John]] in the [[King James Version|King James Bible]]]]
Heraclitus was often read by early Christian philosophers, who<ref name=":5">History of Philosophy, by Friedrich Ueberweg, p. 39</ref> following the Stoics, interpreted the ''logos'' as meaning the Christian "Word of [[God]]", such as in [[John 1:1]]: "In the beginning was the Word (''[[Logos (Christianity)|logos]]'') and the Word was God." [[Hippolytus of Rome]], one of the early [[Church Fathers]] of the [[Christian Church]], identified Heraclitus along with the other pre-Socratics and [[Platonic Academy|Academics]] as a source of [[heresy]], in Heraclitus's case namely the heresy of [[Noetus]].<ref name=":5" /> The Christian apologist [[Justin Martyr]] took a more positive view of Heraclitus.{{sfn|Goodenough|1923|page=110}} In his [[First Apology]], he said both Socrates and Heraclitus were Christians before Christ: "those who lived reasonably are Christians, even though they have been thought atheists; as, among the Greeks, Socrates and Heraclitus, and men like them."<ref>First Apology, Chapter 46</ref> The Christian Clement of Alexandria notes Heraclitus's similarity to the Christian prophets, and is cited as a source for more Heraclitus fragments than any other author.<ref>Dinan, Andrew. "Clement of Alexandria's Predication of the Verb μαντευομαι of Heraclitus." ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'', vol. 16 no. 1, 2008, p. 31-60.

Modern scholars such as John Burnet have viewed the relationship between Heraclitean ''logos'' and Johannine ''logos'' as fallacious, saying; "the Johannine doctrine of the ''logos'' has nothing to do with Herakleitos or with anything at all in Greek philosophy, but comes from the Hebrew Wisdom literature".{{sfn|Burnet|1892|p=133}} When Heraclitus speaks of "God" he does not mean a single deity as an omnipotent and omniscient or God as Creator, the universe being eternal; he meant the divine as opposed to human, the immortal as opposed to the mortal, and the cyclical as opposed to the transient. Thus, it is arguably more accurate to speak of "the Divine" and not of "God".{{sfn|Wheelwright|1959|pages=69-73}}

==== Weeping philosopher ====
[[File:Bramante heracleitus and democritus.jpeg|thumb|[[Donato Bramante]] painted Heraclitus and Democritus as the weeping and laughing philosopher.]]
Heraclitus's influence also extends outside of philosophy. A motif found in art and literature is Heraclitus as the "weeping philosopher" and Democritus as the "laughing philosopher", which may have originated with the Cynic philosopher [[Menippus]],<ref>Lepage, J.L. (2012). Laughing and Weeping Melancholy: Democritus and Heraclitus as Emblems. In: The Revival of Antique Philosophy in the Renaissance.

[[File:Raphael School of Athens Michelangelo.jpg|thumb|left|110px|Heraclitus in ''School of Athens'']]
For example, in [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]]'s "Philosophies for Sale", Heraclitus is auctioned off as the "weeping philosopher" and Democritus as the "laughing philosopher".{{efn|{{harvnb| C5}}}} The Roman poet [[Juvenal]] wrote: "Heraclitus, weep at life much more than you did while alive, for now life is more pitiable."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5e3lBQAAQBAJ Juvenal and the Satiric Emotions] p. 125</ref>

=== Modern ===
Modern interest in early Greek philosophy can be traced back to 1573, when French printer [[Henri Estienne]] (also known as Henricus Stephanus) collected a number of pre-Socratic fragments, including some forty of those of Heraclitus, and published them in [[Latin]] in ''Poesis philosophica.''<ref>''Giannis Stamatellos,'' [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introduction+to+Presocratics%3A+A+Thematic+Approach+to+Early+Greek+Philosophy+with+Key+Readings-p-9780470655030 Introduction to Presocratics: A Thematic Approach to Early Greek Philosophy with Key Readings].

==== Rationalism ====
[[File:Utrecht Moreelse Heraclite.JPG|thumb|180px|Heraclitus painted as the weeping philosopher by [[Johannes Moreelse]] {{circa|1630}}]]
French [[Rationalism|rationalist]] philosopher [[René Descartes]] read Montaigne and wrote in ''[[Passions of the Soul|The Passions of the Soul]]'' that [[indignation]] can be joined by [[pity]] or [[Mockery|derision]], "So the laughter of Democritus and the tears of Heraclitus could have come from the same cause".<ref>Descartes, R.

According to one author "What Heraclitus really meant by the common was...nothing different from what by [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] was expressed by "''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]''".{{sfn|Patrick|1889|page=42}} According to German poet [[Heinrich Blücher]], "If you read the whole system of Spinoza, it is nothing but the changed system of Heraclitus."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bard.edu/library/pdfs/bluecher/VI.%20Heraclitus%20and%20the%20Metaphysical%20Tradition%20(1967)%20-%20Bl%C3%BCcher%20Archives%20PDF.pdf|title=Heraclitus and the Metaphysical Tradition|year=1967|page=7}}</ref> Kahn suggests Spinoza may have been influenced by Heraclitus via the Stoics.{{sfn|Kahn|1979|p=302}}

==== British empiricism ====
Bishop and [[Empiricism|empiricist]] philosopher [[George Berkeley]] claimed Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[alchemy]] was influenced by Heraclitus. He remarked in ''Siris'': "In Plutarch we find it was the opinion of Heraclitus, that the death of fire was a birth to air, and the death of air a birth to water.{{efn|name=Aurel76}} This opinion is also maintained by Sir Isaac Newton."<ref>''Siris: A Chain of Philosophical Reflexions and Inquiries Concerning the Virtues of Tar-Water'', p. 418</ref> Scottish skeptic [[David Hume]] seems to recapitulate Heraclitus while discussing [[personal identity]]: "Thus as the nature of a river consists in the motion and change of parts; tho' in less than four and twenty hours these be totally alter'd; this hinders not the river from continuing the same during several ages."<ref>Treatise of Human Nature, 1. 4. 6. 14</ref>{{sfn|Graham|2008|p=174}}<ref>Flage, D.

=====Common sense=====
[[File:1831 Schlesinger Philosoph Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel anagoria.JPG|thumb|180px|Hegel said "there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in my ''Logic''."]]

India: Cambridge University Press. p. 21-22</ref> On [[Scottish common sense realism|Scottish common sense]]  philosopher [[Thomas Reid]]'s account, Heraclitus was one of the first to extol a common sense philosophy with such quotes as "And though reason is common, most people live as though they had an understanding peculiar to themselves;"{{Efn| name=sextb2|{{harvnb|Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians''|loc=B2}}}} and "understanding is common to all".<ref>Reid, T.

The impression of Heraclitus on [[German idealism|German idealist]] [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] was so profound that he remarked in his ''[[Lectures on the History of Philosophy]]'': "there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in my ''[[Science of Logic|Logic]]''."<ref>Hegel, G. W. F. (1995). Lectures on the History of Philosophy: Greek philosophy to Plato. United Kingdom: University of Nebraska Press. p. 279</ref> Hegel interpreted Heraclitus as a dialetheist and as a process philosopher, seeing the flux or "becoming" in Heraclitus as a natural result of the [[ontology]] of "being" and "non-being" in Parmenides.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§7}} He also doubted the world conflagration (''ekpyrosis'') interpretation, which had been popular since Aristotle.{{sfn|Graham|2019|loc=§4}}

Palgrave Macmillan, London. https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137313447_2</ref> and in his return to philosophy in 1929 he made several remarks resembling those of Heraclitus: "The fundamental thing expressed grammatically: What about the sentence: One cannot step into the same river twice?"<ref>Zettel, Wittgenstein, #459</ref> He then seemed to make a dramatic shift by 1931, saying one can step twice into the same river.<ref>Stern, David G.

Wittgenstein also uses a river image in ''[[On Certainty]]'' (1950) to say even the river-bed may change as foundational logical principles might: "The mythology may change back into a state of flux, the river-bed of thoughts may shift&nbsp;... And the bank of that river consists partly of hard rock, subject to no alteration or only to an imperceptible one, partly of sand, which now in one place now in another gets washed away or deposited."<ref>Wittgenstein, L.
