=== Death ===
Having been diagnosed with advanced stage brain cancer just two months prior, Barry Stroud died on 9 August 2019.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://philosophy.berkeley.edu/news/detail/119|title=Barry Stroud (1935-2019)|last=UC Berkeley - Department of Philosophy|website=philosophy.berkeley.edu|access-date=2019-08-13|archive-date=2019-08-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190813155352/https://philosophy.berkeley.edu/news/detail/119|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Announcing his death, Berkeley Philosophy Department recorded that: <blockquote>''His body of work, his influence on generations of students, his imprint on the character of our department, the example that he set of the purest philosophical inquiry — all of it is beyond reckoning. As hard as it is to imagine what philosophy at Berkeley will be like without him, it is even harder to imagine what it would have been''.<ref name=":7" />
