Retrieved July 1, 2014.</ref> By 1998, she had written four books, including an autobiography. In 2011, still active at the age of 95, she wrote a fifth book, ''The Next American Revolution: Sustainable Activism for the Twenty-First Century'', with Scott Kurashige and published by the [[University of California Press]]. She is regarded as a key figure in the [[Asian American movement|Asian American]], [[Black power movement|Black Power]], and [[Civil Rights movement|Civil Rights]] movements.

==Family and childhood==
=== Early life ===
Boggs was born on June 27, 1915, in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], above her father's restaurant. Her Chinese given name was Yu Ping (玉平), meaning "Jade Peace." She was the daughter of Chin Lee (1870–1965) and his second wife, Yin Lan Ng. Both her parents were originally from [[Taishan, Guangdong]] in [[Qing dynasty|Qing dynasty China]].<ref>{{harvnb|Boggs|1998|p=1}}</ref> Bogg's siblings include one sister, Katherine, and four brothers, Edward, Philip, Robert, and Harry. Chin Lee and Yin Lan Ng immigrated from China to the United States city of [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] in 1911.

=== Education ===
On a scholarship, Boggs went on to study at [[Barnard College]] of [[Columbia University]], where, through professor [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]], she says she was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Boggs|first=Grace Lee|date=2014-04-05|title=My Philosophic Journey|url=https://conversationsthatyouwillneverfinish.wordpress.com/2014/04/05/my-philosophic-journey-by-grace-lee-boggs/|access-date=2020-08-21|website=The Boggs Blog|language=en}}</ref> She graduated in 1935 and then in 1940 received her Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Bryn Mawr College]], where she wrote her dissertation on [[George Herbert Mead]].<ref>Chin Lee, Grace. "Social Individualism: A Systematic Treatment of the Metaphysics of George Herbert Mead." Ph.D. diss. Bryn Mawr College, 1940.</ref>

=== Partnership with James Boggs ===
In 1953, Grace Lee Boggs married [[James Boggs (activist)|James Boggs]], an American political activist and auto worker. They were married for 40 years until James Boggs' death in 1993. Together, they published activist literature, books, and founded the [[National Organization for an American Revolution (NOAR)]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Kendi |first=Ibram X. |date=2016-11-15 |title=In Love and Struggle: A New Book on James and Grace Lee Boggs |url=https://www.aaihs.org/in-love-and-struggle-a-new-book-on-james-and-grace-lee-boggs/ |access-date=2020-06-22 |website=AAIHS |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Walter P.

Interviewed by [[Ibram X. Kendi]] about his joint biography of them, Stephen M. Ward states that together, Grace Lee Boggs and James Boggs "built a durable partnership that was at once marital, intellectual, and political. It was a genuine partnership of equals, remarkable not only for its unique pairing or for its longevity, but also for its capacity to continually generate theoretical reflection and modes of activist engagement."<ref name=":0" />

== Activism ==
Facing significant barriers in the academic world in the 1940s, she took a low-paying job at the [[University of Chicago]] Philosophy Library. As a result of their activism on tenants' rights, she joined the revolutionary left [[Workers Party (US)|Workers Party]], known for its [[Third Camp]] position regarding the [[Soviet Union]], which it saw as [[bureaucratic collectivist]]. At this point, she began the trajectory that she would follow for the rest of her life: a focus on struggles in the African-American community.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Gay, Kathlyn|title=American Dissidents: An Encyclopedia of Activists, Subversives, and Prisoners of Conscience, Volume 1.|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9781598847642|pages=71–73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzQVpPvlVMcC&q=grace%20lee%20boggs&pg=PA72}}</ref>

She met [[C. L. R. James]] during a speaking engagement in [[Chicago]] and moved to New York. She met many activists and cultural figures such as author [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] and dancer [[Katharine Dunham]]. She also translated into English many of the essays in [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'' for the first time. She soon joined the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency]] led by James, [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] and Lee. They focused more centrally on marginalized groups such as women, people of color and youth as well as breaking with the notion of the vanguard party. While originally operating as a tendency of the Workers Party, they briefly rejoined the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] before leaving the Trotskyist left entirely. The Johnson–Forest Tendency also characterized the USSR as [[State Capitalist]]. She wrote for the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency]] under the party pseudonym Ria Stone. She married African-American auto worker and political activist [[James Boggs (activist)|James Boggs]] in 1953.

That same year she and James moved to [[Detroit]], where they continued to focus on [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights]] and [[Black Power movement|Black Power Movement]] activism. As scholar Brian Doucet articulates in his interview conducted with Boggs in 2014, "Living in Detroit influenced the Boggs' thinking on the role of automation, capital flight, and racism."<ref>{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt1t896c9|title=Why Detroit matters: Decline, renewal and hope in a divided city. Ch 25, "Grace Lee Boggs, Activist."|date=2017|publisher=Bristol University Press|editor-last=Doucet|editor-first=Brian|edition=1}}</ref> Boggs helped found the Detroit Asian Political Alliance in 1970.<ref name="extraordinarily92">{{Cite journal|last=Juan|first=Karín Aguilar-San|date=2015|title="We Are Extraordinarily Lucky to Be Living in These Times": A Conversation with Grace Lee Boggs|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=36|issue=2|pages=92–123|doi=10.5250/fronjwomestud.36.2.0092|jstor=10.5250/fronjwomestud.36.2.0092|s2cid=161727837}}</ref>

When C. L. R. James and Raya Dunayevskaya split in the mid-1950s into [[Correspondence Publishing Committee]] led by James and [[News and Letters]] led by Dunayevskaya, Grace and James supported Correspondence Publishing Committee that James tried to advise while in exile in Britain. In 1962 the Boggses broke with James and continued Correspondence Publishing Committee along with [[Lyman Paine]] and [[Freddy Paine]], while James' supporters, such as [[Martin Glaberman]], continued on as a new if short-lived organization, [[Facing Reality]]. The ideas that formed the basis for the 1962 split can be seen as reflected in James Boggs's book, ''The American Revolution: Pages from a Black Worker's Notebook''. Grace unsuccessfully attempted to convince [[Malcolm X]] to run for the United States Senate in 1964. In these years, Boggs wrote a number of books, including ''Revolution and Evolution in the Twentieth Century'' with her husband and focused on community activism in Detroit where she became a widely known activist.

In 1979, Grace Lee Boggs and husband [[James Boggs (activist)|James Boggs]] contributed to the founding of [[National Organization for an American Revolution]] (NOAR).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reuther.wayne.edu/node/2310|title=Walter P. Reuther Library James and Grace Lee Boggs Papers|website=reuther.wayne.edu|access-date=2019-12-29}}</ref>

In the introduction to an extensive interview, scholar [[Karín Aguilar-San Juan]] describes one aspect of Boggs' activism: "Although she believes that racial and gender inequality will always demand struggle, Grace remains adamant that civil- rights- based activism will not lead to the farreaching changes in society that a higher state of human evolution requires." She goes on to explain that Boggs' "political path" has been "guided by her study of global and historical change, hand- in- hand with daily participation in and observation of the struggles of people at the grassroots level." In this interview Boggs discusses her relationship to her Asian American heritage, her experience with the Black Power movement, and many other topics.<ref name="extraordinarily92"/>

She founded [[Detroit Summer]], a multicultural intergenerational youth program, in 1992, and was the recipient of numerous awards. Additionally, Boggs' home in Detroit also serves as headquarters for the Boggs Center to Nurture Community Leadership. The Boggs Center was founded in the early 1990s by friends of Grace Lee and James Boggs and continues to be a hub for community-based projects, grassroots organizing, and social activism both locally and nationally.<ref name="On Being with Krista Tippett">{{cite web|url= http://www.onbeing.org/program/becoming-detroit/transcript/5836|title= Grace Lee Boggs – A Century in the World|website= On Being with Krista Tippett|access-date= September 3, 2015|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905174253/http://www.onbeing.org/program/becoming-detroit/transcript/5836|archive-date= September 5, 2015}}</ref>
