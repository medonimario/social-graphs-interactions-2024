'''Rudolf Christoph Eucken''' ({{IPA|de|ˈʁuːdɔlf ˈʔɔʏkn̩|-|De-Rudolf Eucken.ogg}}; 5 January 1846{{snd}}14 September 1926<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1908/eucken/facts/ |title= Rudolf Eucken |website=Rudolf Eucken Facts |access-date=3 June 2023}}</ref>) was a German [[philosopher]]. He received the [[1908 Nobel Prize in Literature]] "in recognition of his earnest search for truth, his penetrating power of thought, his wide range of vision, and the warmth and strength in presentation with which in his numerous works he has vindicated and developed an idealistic philosophy of life", after he had been nominated by a member of the [[Swedish Academy]].<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=3471 nobelprize.org]</ref>

==Early life==
Eucken was born on 5 January 1846 in [[Aurich]], then in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (now [[Lower Saxony]]). His father, Ammo Becker Eucken died when he was a child, and he was brought up by his mother, Ida Maria (née Gittermann).<ref name="Bio2"/> He was educated at Aurich, where one of his teachers was the [[classical philologist]] and philosopher Ludwig Wilhelm Maximilian Reuter.<ref name=eb1911>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Eucken, Rudolf Christoph|volume=9|page=878}}</ref> He studied at [[Göttingen University]] (1863–1866), where [[Hermann Lotze]] was one of his teachers, and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]].<ref name="Bio2">{{cite web |title=Biografie Rudolf Christoph Eucken (German) |url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz19591.html |access-date=5 August 2015 |publisher=Bayerische Nationalbibliothek}}</ref> In the latter place, [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg]] was a professor whose ethical tendencies and historical treatment of philosophy greatly attracted him.

==Career==
Eucken received his [[PhD]] in classical [[philology]] and [[ancient history]] at [[Göttingen University]] in 1866 with a dissertation titled ''De Aristotelis dicendi ratione''.<ref>The dissertation is available [https://archive.org/details/dearistotelisdi00euckgoog online at Internet Archive].</ref> However, the inclination of his mind was definitely towards the philosophical side of [[theology]].<ref name="eb1911"/> In 1871, after five years working as a school teacher at [[Husum]], Berlin und [[Frankfurt]], he was appointed Professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Basel]], [[Switzerland]], succeeding another of his former teachers at Göttingen, [[Gustav Teichmüller]], and beating Friedrich Nietzsche in competition for the position. He stayed there until 1874 when he took up a similar position at the [[University of Jena]].<ref name="eb1911"/> He stayed there until he retired in 1920. In 1912–13, Eucken spent half of the year as an exchange professor at [[Harvard University]], and in 1913 he served as a Deem lecturer at [[New York University]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L3Q7AQAAMAAJ&q=rudolf+eucken+harvard+university&pg=PA28|title=Harvard University Catalogue|last=University|first=Harvard|date=1912|publisher=The University.|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1908/eucken-bio.html|title=Rudolf Eucken - Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-03-14}}</ref> During [[World War I]], Eucken, like many of his academic colleagues, took a strong line in favour of the causes with which his country had associated itself.<ref name="Bio2"/><ref>{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Eucken, Rudolf Christoph|volume=31|pages=13–14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hiršs |first=Andris |date=2023 |title=FILOSOFA RŪDOLFA EIKENA VIZĪTE LATVIJĀ – NEIZPILDĪTĀ MISIJA |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=1248064 |journal=Religiski-filozofiski raksti |language=Latvian |volume=XXXIV |issue=1 |pages=134–155 |issn=1407-1908}}</ref>

==Ethical activism<!--'Ethical activism' and 'Activism (Eucken)' redirect here--->==
Eucken's philosophical work is partly historical and partly [[Moral constructivism|constructive]], the former side being predominant in his earlier, the latter in his later works. Their most striking feature is the close organic relationship between the two parts. The aim of the historical works is to show the necessary connection between philosophical concepts and the age to which they belong; the same idea is at the root of his constructive speculation. All philosophy is [[philosophy of life]], the development of a new culture, not mere [[intellectualism]], but the application of a vital religious inspiration to the practical problems of society. This practical idealism Eucken described by the term "'''ethical activism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->."<ref name="Gibson"/> In accordance with this principle, Eucken gave considerable attention to social and educational problems.<ref name=eb1911/>

He maintained that humans have [[soul]]s, and that they are therefore at the junction between nature and spirit. He believed that people should overcome their non-spiritual nature by continuous efforts to achieve a [[spirituality|spiritual]] life, another aspect of his [[ethical]] [[activism]] and [[meaning of life]].

==Later life and death==
Rudolf Eucken married Irene Passow in 1882 and had a daughter and two sons. His son [[Walter Eucken]] became a famous founder of [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] thought in [[Neoliberal economics|economics]]. His son [[Arnold Eucken]] was a chemist and physicist.<ref name="Bio2"/>

Rudolf Eucken died on 15 September 1926 in [[Jena]] at the age of 80.<ref name="Bio2"/>
