In 1073–4 peace was concluded with [[Sultan]] [[Malik-Shah I]] who had made incursions into Karakhanid dominions. Khayyam entered the service of Malik-Shah in 1074 when he was invited by the [[vizier|Grand Vizier]] [[Nizam al-Mulk]] to meet Malik-Shah in the city of [[Merv|Marv]]. Khayyam was subsequently commissioned to set up an observatory in [[Isfahan]] and lead a group of scientists in carrying out precise astronomical observations aimed at the revision of the Persian calendar. The undertaking probably began with the opening of the observatory in 1074 and ended in 1079,<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom"/>{{rp|28–29}} when Omar Khayyam and his colleagues concluded their measurements of the length of the year, reporting it as 365.24219858156 days.<ref name=mactutor/> Given that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person's lifetime, this is outstandingly accurate. For comparison, the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days.

After the death of Malik-Shah and his vizier (murdered, it is thought, by the [[Ismaili]] [[order of Assassins]]), Khayyam fell from favor at court, and as a result, he soon set out on his [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]]. A possible ulterior motive for his pilgrimage reported by [[Al-Qifti]], was a public demonstration of his faith with a view to allaying suspicions of skepticism and confuting the allegations of unorthodoxy (including possible sympathy or adherence to Zoroastrianism) levelled at him by a hostile clergy.<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|29}}<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|29}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aminrazavi|first=M.|author-link=Mehdi Aminrazavi|date=2010|title=Review: Omar Khayyam: Poet, Rebel, Astronomer, Hazhir Teimourian|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=XLIII|issue=4|pages=569–571|jstor=23033230|doi=10.1080/00210862.2010.495592|s2cid=162241136|url-access=registration|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23033230 }}</ref> He was then invited by the new [[Sultan Sanjar]] to Marv, possibly to work as a court [[astrologer]].<ref name="Britannica"/> He was later allowed to return to Nishapur owing to his declining health.

Omar Khayyam died at the age of 83 in his hometown of Nishapur on 4 December 1131, and he is buried in what is now the [[Mausoleum of Omar Khayyám|Mausoleum of Omar Khayyam]]. One of his disciples [[Nizami Aruzi]] relates the story that sometime during 1112–3 Khayyam was in [[Balkh]] in the company of [[Al-Isfizari|Isfizari]] (one of the scientists who had collaborated with him on the Jalali calendar) when he made a prophecy that "my tomb shall be in a spot where the north wind may scatter roses over it".<ref name="Boyle"/>{{rp|36}}<ref name="FitzGerald"/> Four years after his death, Aruzi located his tomb in a cemetery in a then large and well-known quarter of Nishapur on the road to Marv.

Part of Khayyam's ''Commentary on the Difficulties Concerning the Postulates of Euclid's Elements'' deals with the [[parallel axiom]].<ref name="Struik" />{{rp|282}} The treatise of Khayyam can be considered the first treatment of the axiom not based on [[petitio principii]], but on a more intuitive postulate.

[[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|Tusi]]'s commentaries on Khayyam's treatment of parallels made its way to Europe. [[John Wallis]], professor of geometry at [[Oxford]], translated Tusi's commentary into Latin. Jesuit geometer [[Girolamo Saccheri]], whose work (''euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus'', 1733) is generally considered the first step in the eventual development of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], was familiar with the work of Wallis. The American historian of mathematics [[David Eugene Smith]] mentions that Saccheri "used the same lemma as the one of Tusi, even lettering the figure in precisely the same way and using the lemma for the same purpose". He further says that "Tusi distinctly states that it is due to Omar Khayyam, and from the text, it seems clear that the latter was his inspirer."<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|195}}<ref name="Great Muslim Mathematicians" />{{rp|104}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith |first=D.E.|author-link=David Eugene Smith|journal=Scripta Mathematica|title=Euclid, Omar Khayyâm, and Saccheri|pages=5–10|date=1935|volume=III|issue=1|oclc=14156259}}</ref>

Khayyam discusses the relationship between the concept of ratio and the concept of number and explicitly raises various theoretical difficulties. In particular, he contributes to the theoretical study of the concept of [[irrational number]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vahabzadeh |first1=Bijan|editor-last=Jafar Aghayani-Chawoshi|title=Omar Khayyam and the Concept of Irrational Numbers|journal=Farhang: Quarterly Journal of Humanities and Cultural Studies.

[[Adolph P. Yushkevich|Youschkevitch]] and Rosenfeld argue that "by placing irrational quantities and numbers on the same operational scale, [Khayyam] began a true revolution in the doctrine of number."<ref name=DSB-Khayyam/>{{rp|327b}} Likewise, it was noted by [[Dirk Jan Struik|D. J. Struik]] that Omar was "on the road to that extension of the number concept which leads to the notion of the [[real number]]."<ref name="Struik" />{{rp|284}}

Rashed and Vahabzadeh (2000) have argued that because of his thoroughgoing geometrical approach to algebraic equations, Khayyam can be considered the precursor of [[Descartes]] in the invention of [[analytic geometry]].<ref name ="Cooper">{{cite journal |last1=Cooper |first1=Glen M. |title=Review: Omar Khayyam, the Mathmetician by R.

In this work, he devoted himself mainly to investigating whether it is possible to divide a circular quadrant into two parts such that the line segments projected from the dividing point to the [[perpendicular]] diameters of the circle form a specific ratio. His solution, in turn, employed several curve constructions that led to equations containing cubic and quadratic terms.<ref name="Cooper" />{{rp|248}}

====Solution of cubic equations====

In 1074–5, Omar Khayyam was commissioned by Sultan Malik-Shah to build an [[Isfahan Observatory|observatory at Isfahan]] and reform the [[Iranian calendar|Persian calendar]]. There was a panel of eight scholars working under the direction of Khayyam to make large-scale astronomical observations and revise the astronomical tables.<ref name="Evelyn Kennedy" />{{rp|141}} Recalibrating the calendar fixed the first day of the year at the exact moment of the passing of the Sun's center across [[March equinox|vernal equinox]].

The Jalālī calendar was a true [[solar calendar]] where the duration of each month is equal to the time of the passage of the Sun across the corresponding sign of the [[Zodiac]]. The calendar reform introduced a unique 33-year [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] cycle. As indicated by the works of [[al-Khazini|Khazini]], Khayyam's group implemented an intercalation system based on quadrennial and quinquennial [[leap years]]. Therefore, the calendar consisted of 25 ordinary years that included 365 days, and 8 leap years that included 366 days.<ref>{{cite arXiv|last1=Heydari-Malayeri|first1=M.|title=Concise Review of the Iranian Calendar|date=21 October 2004|eprint=astro-ph/0409620v2}}</ref>{{rp|13}} The calendar remained in use across [[Greater Iran]] from the 11th to the 20th centuries. In 1911 the Jalali calendar became the official national calendar of [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]]. In 1925 this calendar was simplified and the names of the months were modernized, resulting in the [[Iranian calendars#Modern calendar: Solar Hijri (SH)|modern Iranian calendar]]. The Jalali calendar is more accurate than the [[Gregorian calendar]] of 1582,<ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" />{{rp|659}} with an error of one day accumulating over 5,000 years, compared to one day every 3,330 years in the Gregorian calendar.<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|200}} [[Moritz Cantor]] considered it the most perfect calendar ever devised.<ref name="Great Muslim Mathematicians"/>{{rp|101}}

One of his pupils [[Nizami Aruzi|Nizami Aruzi of Samarcand]] relates that Khayyam apparently did not have a belief in astrology and divination: "I did not observe that he (''scil.'' Omar Khayyam) had any great belief in astrological predictions, nor have I seen or heard of any of the great [scientists] who had such belief."<ref name="Whinfield" />{{rp|11}} While working for Sultan Sanjar as an astrologer he was asked to predict the weather – a job that he apparently did not do well.<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|30}} [[George Saliba]] explains that the term {{transliteration|ar|‘ilm al-nujūm}}, used in various sources in which references to Khayyam's life and work could be found, has sometimes been incorrectly translated to mean astrology. He adds: "from at least the middle of the tenth century, according to [[Farabi]]'s ''Enumeration of the Sciences'', that this science, {{transliteration|ar|‘ilm al-nujūm}}, was already split into two parts, one dealing with astrology and the other with theoretical mathematical astronomy."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Saliba|first1=G.|author-link=George Saliba|title=Review: Al-Khayyām Mathématicien, by R.

==Other works==
{{See also|Specific gravity}}

Khayyam has a short treatise devoted to [[Archimedes' principle]] (in full title, ''On the Deception of Knowing the Two Quantities of Gold and Silver in a Compound Made of the Two''). For a compound of gold adulterated with silver, he describes a method to measure more exactly the weight per capacity of each element. It involves weighing the compound both in air and in water, since weights are easier to measure exactly than volumes. By repeating the same with both gold and silver one finds exactly how much heavier than water gold, silver and the compound were. This treatise was extensively examined by [[Eilhard Wiedemann]] who believed that Khayyam's solution was more accurate and sophisticated than that of [[al-Khazini|Khazini]] and [[Al-Nayrizi]] who also dealt with the subject elsewhere.<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|198}}

Another short treatise is concerned with [[music theory]] in which he discusses the connection between music and arithmetic. Khayyam's contribution was in providing a systematic classification of musical scales, and discussing the mathematical relationship among notes, minor, major and [[tetrachords]].<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|198}}

==Poetry==
[[File:Chayyam guyand kasan behescht ba hur chosch ast2.png|thumb|Rendition of a ''ruba'i'' from the Bodleian manuscript, rendered in [[Shekasteh]] calligraphy.]]

The earliest allusion to Omar Khayyam's poetry is from the historian [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani]], a younger contemporary of Khayyam, who explicitly identifies him as both a poet and a scientist ({{transliteration|ar|Kharidat al-qasr}}, 1174).<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|49}}<ref name="Dashti">Ali Dashti (translated by L. P. Elwell-Sutton), ''In Search of Omar Khayyam'', Routledge Library Editions: Iran (2012)</ref>{{rp|35}} One of the earliest specimens of Omar Khayyam's Rubiyat is from [[Fakhr al-Din Razi]]. In his work {{transliteration|ar|al-Tanbih ‘ala ba‘d asrar al-maw‘dat fi’l-Qur’an}} ({{circa|1160}}), he quotes one of his poems (corresponding to quatrain LXII of FitzGerald's first edition). [[Najm al-Din Razi|Daya]] in his writings ({{transliteration|ar|Mirṣād al-‘Ibad}}, c. 1230) quotes two quatrains, one of which is the same as the one already reported by Razi. An additional quatrain is quoted by the historian [[Ata-Malik Juvayni|Juvayni]] ({{transliteration|fa|[[Tarikh-i Jahangushay]]}}, c. 1226–1283).<ref name="Dashti" />{{rp|36–37}}<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|92}} In 1340 [[Jajarmi]] includes thirteen quatrains of Khayyam in his work containing an anthology of the works of famous Persian poets ({{transliteration|ar|Mu’nis al-ahrār}}), two of which have hitherto been known from the older sources.<ref name = "Ross 1927">{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=E.D.|author-link=Edward Denison Ross|title='Omar Khayyam |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies|date=1927|volume=IV|issue=3 |pages=433–439 |doi=10.1017/S0041977X00102897|jstor=606948|s2cid=246638673|url-access=registration|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/606948}}</ref>{{rp|434}} A comparatively late manuscript is the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] MS.

There are occasional quotes of verses attributed to Khayyam in texts attributed to authors of the 13th and 14th centuries, but these are of doubtful authenticity, so that skeptical scholars point out that the entire tradition may be [[pseudepigraphic]].<ref name="Dashti" />{{rp|11}} [[Hans Heinrich Schaeder]] in 1934 commented that the name of Omar Khayyam "is to be struck out from the history of Persian literature" due to the lack of any material that could confidently be attributed to him. De Blois presents a bibliography of the manuscript tradition, concluding pessimistically that the situation has not changed significantly since Schaeder's time.<ref name=Blois>{{cite book |last1=Blois|first1=François de|title=Persian Literature - A Bio-Bibliographical Survey. Volume 5: Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period|date=2004 |publisher=Routledge|location=London & New York|isbn=9780947593476}}</ref><sup>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&pg=PA307 :307]</sup>

Five of the quatrains later attributed to Omar Khayyam are found as early as 30 years after his death, quoted in ''[[Sindbad-Nameh]]''. While this establishes that these specific verses were in circulation in Omar's time or shortly later, it does not imply that the verses must be his. De Blois concludes that at the least the process of attributing poetry to Omar Khayyam appears to have begun already in the 13th century.<ref name=Blois/><sup>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&pg=PA305 :305]</sup> [[Edward Granville Browne]] (1906) notes the difficulty of disentangling authentic from spurious quatrains: "while it is certain that Khayyam wrote many quatrains, it is hardly possible, save in a few exceptional cases, to assert positively that he wrote any of those ascribed to him".<ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" />{{rp|663}}

In addition to the Persian quatrains, there are twenty-five Arabic poems attributed to Khayyam which are attested by historians such as al-Isfahani, [[Al-Shahrazuri|Shahrazuri]] ({{transliteration|ar|Nuzhat al-Arwah}}, c. 1201–1211), Qifti ({{transliteration|ar|Tārikh al-hukamā}}, 1255), and [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] ({{transliteration|fa|[[Tarikh-i guzida]]}}, 1339).<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|39}}

[[John Andrew Boyle|Boyle]] emphasized that there are a number of other [[Persian scholar]]s who occasionally wrote quatrains, including [[Avicenna]], [[al-Ghazali|Ghazali]], and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|Tusi]]. They conclude that it is also possible that for Khayyam poetry was an amusement of his leisure hours: "these brief poems seem often to have been the work of scholars and scientists who composed them, perhaps, in moments of relaxation to edify or amuse the inner circle of their disciples".<ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" />{{rp|662}}

The poetry attributed to Omar Khayyam has contributed greatly to his popular fame in the modern period as a direct result of the extreme popularity of the translation of such verses into English by [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] (1859). FitzGerald's ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' contains loose translations of quatrains from the Bodleian manuscript. It enjoyed such success in the [[fin de siècle]] period that a bibliography compiled in 1929 listed more than 300 separate editions,<ref>Ambrose George Potter, ''A Bibliography of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'' (1929).</ref> and many more have been published since.<ref name=Blois/><sup>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&pg=PA312  :312]</sup>

==Philosophy==
Khayyam considered himself intellectually to be a student of [[Avicenna]].<ref name="NasrRazavi"/>{{rp|474}} According to Al-Bayhaqi, he was reading the metaphysics in Avicenna's ''[[the Book of Healing]]'' before he died.<ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" />{{rp|661}} There are six philosophical papers believed to have been written by Khayyam.

Of his prose works, two, which were stand authority, dealt respectively with precious stones and climatology. Beyond question the poet-astronomer was undevout; and his astronomy doubtless helped to make him so. One contemporary writes: "I did not observe that he had any great belief in astrological predictions; nor have I seen or heard of any of the great (scientists) who had such belief.

In 1872 FitzGerald had a third edition printed which increased interest in the work in America.
