'''Anders Theodor Samuel Nygren''' (15 November 1890 – 20 October 1978) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Lutheran]] theologian. He was professor of [[systematic theology]] at [[Lund University]] from 1924 and was elected [[Bishop of Lund]] in 1948 (emeritus 1958). He is best known for his two-volume work ''[[Agape and Eros]]'' (first published as Eros and Agape in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] in 1930–1936).

Nygren's approach, along with that of [[Gustaf Aulén]], characterizes what is referred to as “[[Lundensian Theology]]”.

Nygren's observations about love are discussed at length in [[M. C. D'Arcy]]'s ''The Mind And Heart Of Love: Lion And Unicorn, A Study In Eros And Agape'', Faber and Faber, 1945.
