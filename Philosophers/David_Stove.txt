'''David Charles Stove''' (15 September 1927 – 2 June 1994) was an Australian philosopher whose writings often challenged prevailing academic orthodoxy. He was known for his critiques of postmodernism, feminism, and multiculturalism.

==Philosophy<!--'Worst argument' and 'Worst argument in the world' redirect here-->==
His work in [[philosophy of science]] included criticisms of [[David Hume]]'s [[inductive scepticism]]. He offered a positive response to the [[problem of induction]] in his 1986 work, ''The Rationality of Induction''. In ''[[Popper and After]]: Four Modern Irrationalists'', Stove attacked the leading philosophers of science, [[Karl Popper]], [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[Imre Lakatos]], and [[Paul Feyerabend]], on the grounds that their commitment to the thesis that all logic is [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] led to [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]].

In 1985 Stove held a competition to find the "'''worst argument in the world'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->", and awarded the prize to himself for the argument "we can know things only under our forms of understanding/as they are related to us, etc, therefore we cannot know things as they are in themselves". He called this argument "The Gem" and argued that it appeared widely in various forms.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Franklin |first1=James |date=2002 |title=Stove's discovery of the worst argument in the world |url=https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/worst.pdf |journal=Philosophy |volume=77 |issue= 4|pages=616–624 |doi=10.1017/S0031819102000487 |s2cid=170547108 |access-date=30 June 2021}}</ref>

His book ''The Plato Cult and Other Philosophical Follies'' contains the influential essay "What Is Wrong With Our Thoughts?". According to philosopher [[Motte-and-bailey fallacy|Nicholas Shackel]], this essay showed that "there are indefinitely many ways of cheating intellectually and for most there is no simple way to put one’s finger on how the cheat is effected."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Motte and Bailey Doctrines {{!}} Practical Ethics |url=https://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2014/09/motte-and-bailey-doctrines/ |access-date=2023-12-02 |website=blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk |language=en-US}}</ref>

Stove was also a critic of [[sociobiology]], describing it as a new religion in which genes play the role of gods.<ref>Stove, David (1992). {{cite web |url=http://www.royalinstitutephilosophy.org/articles/printer_friendly.php?id=27 |title=A New Religion |accessdate=2014-05-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315154747/http://www.royalinstitutephilosophy.org/articles/printer_friendly.php?id=27 |archivedate=15 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }} ''Philosophy'' '''67''', pp. 233–240.</ref>

==Politics==

Stove and [[David M. Armstrong]] both resisted what they saw as attempts by [[Marxists]] to infiltrate the Faculty of Arts at the [[University of Sydney]]. In 1984–85 Stove protested publicly that the faculty was favouring women in appointments.<ref>Stove, David (1985). "Jobs for the Girls: Feminist Vapours," ''Quadrant'' '''29''' (5), pp. 34–35.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Franklin |first=James |authorlink=James Franklin (philosopher)  |date=1999 |title=The Sydney Philosophy Disturbances |url=https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/sydq.html |journal=Quadrant |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=16–21 |access-date=6 Jan 2024}}</ref>

In "A Farewell to Arts", Stove wrote that he abandoned Marxism when he discovered "what real intellectual work was".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stove |first1=David |date=May 1986 |title=A farewell to Arts: Marxism, semiotics and feminism |url=https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/arts.html |journal=Quadrant |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=8–11 |doi= |access-date=30 June 2021}}</ref>

In his essay "Why You Should be A Conservative", Stove argued that actions can have unforeseen and unwelcome consequences; that just because something is wrong or evil, it does not follow that the world would be better off without it; and that a decline in respect for life and property had led to a decline in quality of life.<ref>Stove, David (2002). "Why You Should be A Conservative". In: ''On Enlightenment.'' New Brunswick and London: Transaction, pp. 171–178.</ref>

In "Racial and Other Antagonisms" (1989) Stove asserted that racism is not a form of [[prejudice]] but common sense: "Almost everyone unites in declaring 'racism' false and detestable. Yet absolutely everyone knows it is true".<ref>Stove, David (1989). "Racial and Other Antagonisms," ''Proceedings of the Russellian Society'' '''14''', pp. 1–10 (Repr. in ''Cricket versus Republicanism''. Sydney: Quakers Hill Press, 1995, p. 147.)</ref>

In "The Intellectual Capacity of Women" (1990) he stated his belief that "the intellectual capacity of women is on the whole inferior to that of men".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stove |first1=David |date=1990 |title=The intellectual capacity of women |url=https://wmbriggs.com/post/17124/ |journal=Proceedings of the Russellian Society |volume=15 |issue= |pages=1–16 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref><ref> Also see Kimball, Roger (1997).

==Legacy==

Since his death in 1994 four collections of his writings have been published. Two were edited by art critic [[Roger Kimball]]: ''Against the Idols of the Age'' and ''Darwinian Fairytales''. Kimball also wrote the foreword to ''What's Wrong With Benevolence'', in which he writes "The most thrilling intellectual discovery of my adult life came in 1996 when I chanced upon the work of the Australian philosopher David Stove".

==Personal life==

With his wife Jessie, he had two children, Judith and [[R. J. Stove]].

Stove enjoyed cricket, baroque music and gardening.<ref name="WeeklyStandard">Torrance, Kelly Jane (2011). [https://web.archive.org/web/20120423172045/http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/all-there_609215.html?nopager=1 "Is That All There Is?,"] ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' '''17''' (11).</ref>

Stove committed [[suicide]] after being diagnosed with [[esophageal cancer]].<ref>R. J.
