'''Radovan Richta''' (6 June 1924 – 21 July 1983) was a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] [[philosopher]] who coined the term [[technological evolution]]; a theory about how societies diminish physical labour by increasing mental labour.{{#tag:ref|Ondryáš, Karel [http://www.sds.cz/docs/prectete/epubl/kon_arr.htm "Akademik Radovan Richta"], Marathon 4/1999, in Czech, accessed 14 November 2010. (Note: The Czech word "Akademik" in this context means specifically a member of the [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]].)|name="Ondryas1999"}}

Richta's first work was ''Člověk a technika v revoluci našich dnů'' ("Man and Technology in the Revolution of Our Day"), published in 1963. This work did much to bring the concept of technology into the forefront of philosophical thought during the 1960s. Richta then went on to publish ''Civilizace na rozcestí'' ("Civilization at the Crossroads") in 1966.<ref>Richta, Radovan "Civilizace na rozcestí" ("Civilization at the Crossroads"), Svoboda, Praha 1966, in Czech</ref> "Crossroads" was a compilation work published by 60 authors (including and led by Richta) that "attempt[ed] to analyze the social and human implications of the scientific and technological revolution".<ref>"Civilization at the Crossroads", Third expanded edition. Trans. Marian Slingova, p. 13</ref> The concepts touched on in "Crossroads" are considered by some philosophical historians to be very ground-breaking for their time.

Richta developed the famous term of "[[Socialism with a human face]]" serving as a motto of the [[Prague Spring]] period. He became the director of the Institute for Philosophy and Sociology of the [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]] in 1969–1982.<ref>{{cite book |author=coll.|url=http://sreview.soc.cas.cz/uploads/4afd0594ada93f23ac70aa1756614ef2d4a564ff_645_ceska%20sociologie.pdf|title=Česká sociologie v letech 1965–1989|page=705€language=cs|access-date=14 November 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://syndikat-novinaru.cz/13/48/176/1969/prosinec "Prosinec 1969"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207183318/http://syndikat-novinaru.cz/13/48/176/1969/prosinec |date=2010-12-07}}, Syndikát novinářů České republiky ("Syndicate of the Journalists of the Czech Republic"), in Czech, accessed November 14, 2010</ref>

== Life ==
Richta was born in [[Prague]].<ref name="Ondryas1999"/> During [[World War II]], Richta organized a resistance movement against the [[Nazis]], and his organization became part of the communist resistance in the critical moment of the worst persecution (or man-hunting). Richta was arrested and held prisoner for several months. He was saved by the Swiss Red Cross when they collected prisoners with the worst cases of [[tuberculosis]] and extracted them to Switzerland. Shortly after the rescue Richta's former fellow prisoners were executed on 2 May 1945.<ref group="note">The translation is vague - the author could have meant the prisoners were killed without sentence.</ref><ref name="MarathonRevolutionaries">Jan Smíšek.

After the war Richta became quite ill, and beginning in 1958 he periodically spent time in sanatoria.<ref name="MarathonRevolutionaries"/> In between bouts of sickness, and in a compromise with his doctors who prescribed complete bed rest, Richta studied and worked very hard.

In the 1960s Richta took on the role of the leader of an interdisciplinary research team. In 1963 they released their first works - ''Člověk a technika v revoluci našich dnů'' ("Man and technology in the revolution of our days") and ''Komunismus a proměny lidského života'' (K povaze humanismu naší doby) ("Communism and changes of human life. To the nature of humanism of our time").<ref name="MarathonRevolutionaries"/>
