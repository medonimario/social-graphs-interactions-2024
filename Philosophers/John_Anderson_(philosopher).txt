'''John Anderson''' (1 November 1893 – 6 July 1962) was a Scottish philosopher who occupied the post of [[Challis Professor]] of Philosophy at [[Sydney University]] from 1927 to 1958. He founded the [[empirical]] brand of philosophy known as [[Australian realism]].

Anderson's promotion of '[[freethought]]' in all subjects, including politics and [[morality]], was controversial and brought him into constant conflict with the august senate of the university. However, he is credited with educating a generation of influential 'Andersonian' thinkers and activists—some of whom helped to place Sydney in the forefront of the '[[sexual revolution]]' of the 1950s and 1960s.

To Anderson, an acceptable philosophy must have significant 'sweep' and be capable of challenging and moulding ideas in every aspect of intellect and society.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in [[Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire|Stonehouse]], Lanarkshire, Scotland and educated at the former [[Hamilton Academy]] from which school he won a bursary to attend the [[University of Glasgow]] in the university's Bursary Competition of 1911.<ref name="ADB">{{Cite book|url=https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/anderson-john-5017|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=W.

Retrieved 17 January 2011</ref>

Anderson graduated [[MA (Scotland)|MA]] from Glasgow University in 1917, with first-class honours in Philosophy (Logic and Moral Philosophy), and first-class honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. After graduation, he was awarded the Ferguson Scholarship in Philosophy and the Shaw Philosophical Fellowship, the examinations for which were open to graduates of any of the four Scottish universities.<ref name=smhdec1926>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16338321?searchTerm=%22Professor%20John%20Anderson%22%20&searchLimits= The Challis Chair: Prof John Anderson's Appointment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222044704/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/16338321?searchTerm=%22Professor%20John%20Anderson%22%20&searchLimits= |date=22 February 2020 }} ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 7 December 1926, p 12</ref>

He served as Assistant in Philosophy at the [[University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire|University College, Cardiff]] (Cardiff) (1917–19), in Moral Philosophy and Logic in the University of Glasgow (1919–20) and lectured in Logic and Metaphysics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1920–26).<ref name=smhdec1926/>

==Social and Political Theory==
After arriving in Sydney in 1927 he associated with the [[Communist Party of Australia]] and contributed to their journals, sometimes under a nom de plume<ref name="ADB"/> but, by about 1932 he began to believe that communism under [[Joseph Stalin]] in the [[Soviet Union]] was a dictatorship with no room for workers' control or participation. He then became aligned with the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] movement for a period of time. But "[h]e could not put up any longer with [[dialectical materialism]] or with the servile state which he saw was being imposed by the doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat".<ref name="ADB"/><ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49425870 Russia: Is She Approaching a Crisis?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240616164219/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/49425870 |date=16 June 2024 }} ''[[The Northern Standard]]'', 2 August 1935, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]</ref>

During the war years, Anderson developed a unique theory of liberal democracy where liberty was not a right, but an activity exercised in opposition to the State. Similarly, democracy was not a set of formal features of a system of government, but is the way a group proceeds in its decision making processes.<ref>A Perilous and Fighting Life (Ed. Mark Weblin) Pluto Press, Sydney, 2005</ref> After the war, he was vehemently opposed to Communism, describing it as 'the disease of the modern time'. He became what would today be called a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]]—an opponent of all forms of [[authoritarianism]].

==Advocacy of academic freedom==
As Sydney University's [[Challis Professorship|Challis Professor]] of Philosophy, Anderson was a formidable champion of the principle of academic freedom from authoritarian intervention. For example, he fought a successful battle to end the role of the [[British Medical Association]] in setting course standards and student quotas in the medical school. He also railed against the presence on campus of a military unit—the [[Sydney University Regiment]]—and lived to see the day in 1960 when the regiment's campus HQ was destroyed by fire. (The regiment was subsequently rehoused at a new facility on university-owned land at [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]].)<ref>[http://regimental-books.com.au/sydney-university-regiment-presentation-of-the-queens-and-regimental-colours-p-2700.html Sydney University Regiment Presentation of the Queen's and Regimental Colours] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907002322/http://regimental-books.com.au/sydney-university-regiment-presentation-of-the-queens-and-regimental-colours-p-2700.html |date=7 September 2018 }} Historical exposition at Regimental Books website</ref>

Anderson was censured by the [[Sydney University]] Senate in 1931 after criticising the role of [[war memorials]] in sanctifying war.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21703627 University professor censured] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222044715/http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/21703627 |date=22 February 2020 }} ''The Brisbane Courier'' 22 July 1931, p.19, at Trove, National Library of Australia</ref><ref>Anderson's [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28040568 reply to the Senate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240616164222/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/28040568 |date=16 June 2024 }} was published the same week.

He was president of the society throughout that period.

It is legendary that the university's Senate, accepting that it could not realise its desire to sack the controversial Challis Professor, sought to reduce Anderson's stature and influence by creating a new chair of "Moral and Political Philosophy" to which [[Alan Stout (philosopher)|Alan Stout]] was appointed.<ref name=Stoutobit>Armstrong D.

Stout (who had been urged by Anderson to apply for the position) was a steady admirer and supporter of the Challis Professor and declined to undercut his prestige in any way. The result was that Sydney gained a second prestigious and personable philosopher who "brought a quick intelligence, intellectual grasp, a flair for putting things simply and clearly, together with a genuine respect for the views of others and readiness to appreciate their point of view". On Anderson's retirement, the two departments were merged under Stout as 'the Professor of Philosophy'.<ref name=Stoutobit/>

==Philosophy==
During the thirties, Anderson was widely known as a systematic Realist. His Realism stressed the independence of a thing and its qualities from the relations around them. Hence, an object is not constituted by the perception of it, the truth of a proposition is not determined by the context that surrounds it, the goodness of an action is not determined by the relations that it has, and the beauty of a things is not determined by its relations. However this Realism was part of a wider ontological project known as Empiricism. This ontology was based on the view that the unity of Space and Time, Space-Time, was infinite and was only delimited by the specification of a particular portion of Space-Time, known as a situation. A 'thing' is an occurrence in Space-Time and has certain categorial features. These include identity, diversity, existence, relation, universality, particularity, number, order, quantity, intensity, substance, causality, and individuality. Any possible situation could be expressed in terms of a proposition, understood as the assertion of a subject term, a predicate term, a copula, and a quantifier. This is the core of Anderson's famous identity theory of the proposition: any situation can be expressed as a proposition and any proposition must be asserted in terms of a situation. Hence, situations and propositions are identical.<ref>'Space-Time and the Proposition' (Ed. Mark Weblin) Sydney University Press, Sydney, 2005</ref>
As a committed [[empiricist]], Anderson argued that there is only one realm of "[[being]]" and it can be best understood through science and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic philosophy]]. He asserted that there is no [[Deity|supernatural god]] and that there are no non-natural realms along the lines of [[Theory of forms#Ideal state|Platonic ideals]].
==Influence==
Anderson had a wide influence on several generations of students at Sydney University.
{{blockquote|He is, arguably, the most important philosopher who has worked in Australia. Certainly he was the most important in both the breadth and depth of influence. Among the philosophers who got their original intellectual formation from Anderson are [[John Passmore]], [[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]], [[A. J. Baker|A.J. ('Jim') Baker]], [[David Stove]] and myself. There are lots more. But for every student who became a philosopher there were far, far, more in the law, in medicine, in journalism, in other academic disciplines, that were profoundly influenced by him. I am inclined to think that, especially in the thirties and forties of the last century, Anderson was the person who set the agenda, and set the tone, for intellectual discussion in Sydney.<ref>Armstrong D M Address on 9 July 2005 [http://www.usyd.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=597 ''John Anderson Remembered''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615081204/http://www.usyd.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=597 |date=15 June 2011 }}</ref> – [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]] (2005)}}

Anderson's influence has spread through his personal impact on several generations of students, the "Andersonians", who include the philosophers named above, together with [[Hedley Bull]] and [[Eugene Kamenka]]; the [[World War II]] organiser [[Alfred Conlon|Alf Conlon]], many members of the [[Sydney Push]], Tonga's 'I. [[Futa Helu]], and jurist [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]], later to be Australia's best-remembered governor-general. The Anglo-Australian political scientist [[Kenneth Minogue]] also cited Anderson as a major influence.

==Freethought Society and the Sydney Libertarians==
Anderson's insistence on unceasing inquiry and criticism became central to the intellectual principles of the university's Libertarian Society which supplanted the Freethought Society in the early 1950s and provided a philosophic platform for the much broader subculture known as "[[Sydney Push|the Push]]" throughout the 1960s. He was a defender of [[free speech]] and was critical of the Australian government's bans on certain political publications (1928). He advocated [[Freedom of religion|religious]] and [[Sexual revolution|sexual freedoms]] and free discussion of issues in an era when mention of [[taboo]] subjects commonly resulted in angry public condemnation by prominent moralists.

After the Second World War, however, Anderson began exhibiting more conservative views. Jim Baker interprets this latter stage not so much as "a definite change in his overall thinking than ... an alteration of emphasis and interest".<ref name=bakerasp>{{cite book|title=Anderson's Social Philosophy: The Social Thought and Political Life of Professor John Anderson|last=Baker|first=A J|publisher=Angus & Robertson 1979|location=Sydney}}</ref>{{rp|p130}} In other words, according to Baker, while Anderson's political positions changed over time his philosophy remained constant. To many, however, it seemed that Anderson was departing from his pluralism. During the [[1949 Australian coal strike|1949 coal miners' strike]], for instance, he supported the government's action in using troops as strikebreakers.<ref name=bakerasp/> At a Freethought Society meeting in August 1950 he refused to [[Conscription#Arguments against conscription|oppose]] [[Conscription in Australia#National service in the 1950s|conscription for the war in Korea]].<ref name=Coombs>{{cite book|title=Sex and Anarchy: The Life and Death of the Sydney Push|last=Coombs|first=Anne|publisher=Viking 1996|location=Ringwood, Victoria}}</ref>{{rp|p12}} In 1951 he refused to allow students to use the Freethought Society to canvass the 'No' case for [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]]' attempt to ban the Communist Party in the [[referendum]] of that year.<ref name=Coombs/>{{rp|p130}} This was the last straw for many Freethinkers; Anderson's apparent authoritarianism caused most to abandon the Freethought Society and to establish the Libertarian Society. (It must be pointed out that Anderson did not support the banning of the Communist Party—in fact he attacked the proposal.<ref name=Weblin>Weblin, Mark (ed.), ''A Perilous and Fighting Life: From Communist to Conservative: The Political Writings of Professor John Anderson'' (North Melbourne: Pluto Press, 2003)</ref>{{rp|p18}}) The Freethought Society held its last meeting in 1951.<ref name=bakerasp/>{{rp|p130}} The Libertarian Society functioned from 1952 to 1969.<ref name=bakerasp/>{{rp|p144}}

Anderson broke off contact with the former disciples who formed the Libertarian Society and never associated with [[Sydney Push|"Push"]] people who routinely sang his praises along with the bawdy songs he had imported to his new country.<ref>''Ballad of Professor John Glaister'' is one example, some of the words of which have been published in ''Snatches & Lays'' (Sun Books, Melbourne, 1975)</ref> However, even after retirement in 1958 and to the brink of his death in 1962, he was seen daily in his study, continuing his work and reviewing earlier work. Among his last publications were ''Classicism'' (1960), ''Empiricism and Logic'' (1962) and ''Relational Arguments'' (1962).<ref>Anderson, J.
