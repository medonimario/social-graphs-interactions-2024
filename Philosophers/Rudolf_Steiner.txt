It was, however, no mere playing with words and ideas, but a serious attempt to resolve real problems: the nature and destiny of the human race, the problem of *evil, the human predicament. To a gnostic it brought a release and joy and hope, as if awakening from a nightmare. One later offshoot, Manicheism, became for a time a world religion, reaching as far as China, and there are at least elements of gnosticism in such medieval movements as those of the Bogomiles and the Cathari. Gnostic influence has been seen in various works of modern literature, such as those of William Blake and W. B. Yeats, and is also to be found in the Theosophy of Madame Blavatsky and the Anthroposophy of Rudolph Steiner. Gnosticism was of lifelong interest to the psychologist C. G. *Jung, and one of the Nag Hammadi codices (the Jung Codex) was for a time in the Jung Institute in Zurich. |ref=none}}}}</ref><ref name="Diener Hipolito 2013 p. 77">{{Cite book |last=Diener |first=Astrid |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kf7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA77 |title=The Role of Imagination in Culture and Society: Owen Barfield's Early Work |last2=Hipolito |first2=Jane |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-7252-3320-1 |page=77 |quote=a neognostic heresy |access-date=6 March 2023 |origyear=2002}}</ref><ref name="Ellwood Partin 2016 p.

In this category there are several Neo-Gnostic and Neo-Rosicrucian groups. The Anthroposophy of Rudolf Steiner is also in this category. On the other hand, there are what may be termed "new revelation" Theosophical schisms, generally based on new revelations from the Masters not accepted by the main traditions.

== Biography ==

=== Childhood and education ===
[[File:Rudolf Steiner Geburtshaus,Donji Kraljevec, Croatia.JPG|thumb|left|The house where Rudolf Steiner was born, in present-day [[Croatia]]]]

Steiner's father, Johann(es) Steiner (1829–1910), left a position as a [[gamekeeper]]<ref name="GL" /> in the service of Count [[House of Hoyos|Hoyos]] in [[Geras, Austria|Geras]], northeast [[Lower Austria]] to marry one of the Hoyos family's housemaids, Franziska Blie (1834 [[Horn, Austria|Horn]] – 1918, Horn), a marriage for which the Count had refused his permission. Johann became a telegraph operator on the Southern Austrian Railway, and at the time of Rudolf's birth was stationed in Murakirály ([[Donji Kraljevec|Kraljevec]]) in the [[Međimurje (region)|Muraköz]] region of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Austrian Empire]] (present-day Donji Kraljevec in the [[Medjimurje|Međimurje]] region of northernmost [[Croatia]]). In the first two years of Rudolf's life, the family moved twice, first to [[Mödling]], near [[Vienna]], and then, through the promotion of his father to stationmaster, to [[:de:Pottschach|Pottschach]], located in the foothills of the eastern Austrian [[Alps]] in [[Lower Austria]].<ref name="CL" />

Steiner entered the village school, but following a disagreement between his father and the schoolmaster, he was briefly educated at home. In 1869, when Steiner was eight years old, the family moved to the village of [[Neudörfl]] and in October 1872 Steiner proceeded from the village school there to the [[realschule]] in [[Wiener Neustadt]].<ref name="Auto">Rudolf Steiner [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/English/APC1928/GA028_index.html Autobiography: Chapters in the Course of My Life: 1861–1907], Lantern Books, 2006</ref>{{rp|Chap. 2}}

The research by Dr Sam confirms the details. Rudolf Steiner studied for eight semesters at the Technical University in Vienna - as a student in the General Department, which was there in addition to the engineering, construction, mechanical engineering and chemical schools. The general department comprised all subjects that could not be clearly assigned to one of these four existing technical schools. Around 1880 this included mathematics, descriptive geometry, physics, as well as general and supplementary subjects such as German language and literature, history, art history, economics, legal subjects, languages, The students in the General Department - unlike their fellow students in the specialist departments - neither had to complete a fixed curriculum nor take a final or state examination. They did not have to and could not - because that was not intended for this department, nor was the "[[Absolutorium]]". Final state examinations at the Vienna University of Technology only began in the academic year 1878/79. The paper reports how at that time, the so-called ‘individual examinations’ in the subjects studied seemed to be of greater importance and were reported first in the 'Annual Report of the Technical University 1879/80' - sorted according to the faculties of the Technical University. Steiner was in fact amongst the best student on these grounds and was cited by the University as one of its distinguished alumni. The records for the examinations he sat are on record as is the scholarship record.</ref> In 1882, one of Steiner's teachers, [[Karl Julius Schröer]],<ref name=Auto/>{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c03.html Chap. 3]}} suggested Steiner's name to Joseph Kürschner, chief editor of a new edition of Goethe's works,{{sfn|Ahern|2009}} who asked Steiner to become the edition's natural science editor,<ref>[[Alfred Heidenreich]], [http://southerncrossreview.org/36/heidenreich.htm Rudolf Steiner – A Biographical Sketch]</ref> a truly astonishing opportunity for a young student without any form of academic credentials or previous publications.<ref name="ZanderBio">{{Cite book |last=Zander |first=Helmut |title=Rudolf Steiner: Die Biografie |date=2011 |publisher=Piper |isbn=978-3-492-05448-5 |publication-place=München Zürich |language=de}}</ref>{{rp|43}} In fact, it was a low-paid and boring job, according to Steiner himself.<ref name="Cees" />

Before attending the Vienna Institute of Technology, Steiner had studied [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Fichte]] and [[F. W. J. Schelling|Schelling]].<ref name="CorrDoc">Steiner, ''Correspondence and Documents 1901–1925'', 1988, p. 9. {{ISBN|0880102071}}</ref>

=== Early spiritual experiences ===
[[File:Steiner als Student.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolf Steiner as 21-year-old student (1882)]]
When he was nine years old, Steiner believed that he saw the spirit of an aunt who had died in a far-off town, asking him to help her at a time when neither he nor his family knew of the woman's death.<ref>The Collected Works of Rudolf Steiner. ''Esoteric Lessons 1904–1909''. SteinerBooks, 2007.</ref> Steiner later related that as a child, he felt "that one must carry the knowledge of the spiritual world within oneself after the fashion of geometry ... [for here] one is permitted to know something which the mind alone, through its own power, experiences. In this feeling I found the justification for the spiritual world that I experienced ... I confirmed for myself by means of geometry the feeling that I must speak of a world 'which is not seen'."<ref name=Auto/>

Steiner believed that at the age of 15 he had gained a complete understanding of the concept of time, which he considered to be the precondition of spiritual [[clairvoyance]].<ref name="CorrDoc" /> At 21, on the train between his home village and [[Vienna]], Steiner met a herb gatherer, Felix Kogutzki, who spoke about the spiritual world "as one who had his own experience therein".<ref name="Auto" />{{rp|39–40}}<ref>Steiner, GA 262, pp. 7–21.</ref>

=== Writer and philosopher ===
The young Steiner emerged as an individualist, [[positivism|positivist]] and freethinker, who was not afraid to refer to scandalous philosophers such as Stirner, Nietzsche and Haeckel. His freethinking culminated in a contempt for religion and faith. He attributed almost pathological traits to Christianity.<ref>So Gerhard Wehr: ''Rudolf Steiner. Leben, Erkenntnis, Kulturimpuls. Eine Biographie''. Diogenes, Zürich 1993, p. 132.</ref> 

In 1888, as a result of his work for the Kürschner edition of [[Goethe]]'s works, Steiner was invited to work as an editor at the Goethe archives in [[Weimar]]. Steiner remained with the archive until 1896. It was a low-paid and boring job.<ref name="Cees" /> As well as the introductions for and commentaries to four volumes of Goethe's scientific writings, Steiner wrote two books about Goethe's philosophy: ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'' (1886),<ref>[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/ "Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception"], also translated as ''Goethe's Theory of Knowledge, An Outline of the Epistemology of His Worldview''</ref> which Steiner regarded as the [[epistemological]] foundation and justification for his later work,<ref>Preface to 1924 edition of [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/English/AP1985/GA002_pre1924.html ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception, with Specific Reference to Schiller''], in which Steiner also wrote that the way of knowing he presented in this work opened the way from the sensory world to the spiritual one.</ref> and ''Goethe's Conception of the World'' (1897).<ref>Rudolf Steiner, ''Goethean Science'', Mercury Press, 1988 {{ISBN|0-936132-92-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-936132-92-1}}, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA001/English/MP1988/GA001_index.html link]</ref> During this time he also collaborated in complete editions of the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and the writer [[Jean Paul]] and wrote numerous articles for various journals.

[[File:Rudolf Steiner um 1891.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rudolf Steiner around 1891–92, etching by Otto Fröhlich]]

In 1891, Steiner received a doctorate in philosophy at the [[University of Rostock]], for his dissertation discussing 
[[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]]'s concept of the ego,<ref name=RAMcD/><ref>His thesis title was ''Die Grundfrage der Erkenntnistheorie mit besonderer Rücksicht auf Fichte's [[Wissenschaftslehre (Fichte)|Wissenschaftslehre]] – Prolegomena zur Verständigung des philosophierenden Bewusstseins mit sich selbst''.</ref> submitted to {{ill|Heinrich von Stein|de}}, whose ''Seven Books of Platonism'' Steiner esteemed.<ref name=Auto/>{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c14.html Chap. 14]}} Steiner's dissertation was later published in expanded form as ''Truth and Knowledge: Prelude to a Philosophy of Freedom'', with a dedication to [[Eduard von Hartmann]].<ref>[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA003/index.php ''Truth and Knowledge'' (full text)]. {{langx|de|Wahrheit und Wissenschaft – Vorspiel einer Philosophie der Freiheit}}</ref> Two years later, in 1894, he published ''Die Philosophie der Freiheit'' ([[The Philosophy of Freedom|The Philosophy of Freedom ''or'' The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity]], the latter being Steiner's preferred English title), an exploration of [[epistemology]] and ethics that suggested a way for humans to become spiritually free beings. Steiner hoped that the book "would gain him a professorship", but the book was not well received.<ref name="Cees" /> Steiner later spoke of this book as containing implicitly, in philosophical form, the entire content of what he later developed explicitly as [[anthroposophy]].<ref>Sergei Prokofieff, ''May Human Beings Hear It!'', Temple Lodge, 2004. p. 460</ref>

[[File:RudolfSteiner.jpeg|right|thumb|Steiner, c.1900]]
In 1896, Steiner declined an offer from [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] to help organize the Nietzsche archive in [[Naumburg]]. Her brother, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], was by that time ''[[non compos mentis]]''. "Hoping for a job (which, in fact, he did not get), Steiner accepted the invitation immediately."<ref name="o046">{{Cite book |last=Steiner |first=Rudolf |title=Rethinking Economics |date=2013-06-01 |publisher=SteinerBooks |isbn=978-1-62148-050-1 |publication-place=Great Barrington, Mass |page=unpaginated |quote=Hoping for a job (which, in fact, he did not get), Steiner accepted the invitation immediately.}}</ref> Förster-Nietzsche introduced Steiner into the presence of the [[catatonic]] philosopher; Steiner, deeply moved, subsequently wrote the book ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom''.<ref>Rudolf Steiner, ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom'' Garber Communications; 2nd revised edition (July 1985) {{ISBN|978-0893450335}}.

<blockquote>My first acquaintance with Nietzsche's writings belongs to the year 1889. Previous to that I had never read a line of his. Upon the substance of my ideas as these find expression in ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity'', Nietzsche's thought had not the least influence....Nietzsche's ideas of the '[[Ewige Wiederkunft|eternal recurrence]]' and of '[[Übermensch]]' remained long in my mind. For in these was reflected that which a personality must feel concerning the evolution and essential being of humanity when this personality is kept back from grasping the spiritual world by the restricted thought in the philosophy of nature characterizing the end of the 19th century....What attracted me particularly was that one could read Nietzsche without coming upon anything which strove to make the reader a 'dependent' of Nietzsche's.<ref name=Auto/>{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c18.html Chap. 18]}}</blockquote>

In 1897, Steiner left the [[Weimar]] archives and moved to Berlin. He became part owner of, chief editor of, and an active contributor to the literary journal ''Magazin für Literatur'', where he hoped to find a readership sympathetic to his philosophy. Many subscribers were alienated by Steiner's unpopular support of [[Émile Zola]] in the [[Dreyfus Affair]]<ref name="GL">{{harvnb|Lachman|2007}}</ref> and the journal lost more subscribers when Steiner published extracts from his correspondence with anarchist [[John Henry Mackay]].<ref name="GL" /> Dissatisfaction with his editorial style eventually led to his departure from the magazine. In 1899, Steiner married Anna Eunicke; the couple separated several years later. Anna died in 1911.<ref name="CL" />

Despite his fame as a teacher of esotericism, Steiner was culturally and academically isolated.{{sfn|Leijenhorst|2006|p=1088|ps=: "Despite his success as an esoteric teacher, Steiner seems to have suffered from being shut off from academic and general cultural life, given his continued attempts at getting academic positions or jobs as a journalist."}}

=== Theosophical Society ===

[[File:Marie Steiner.jpg|upright|thumb|Marie Steiner, 1903]]
In 1899, Steiner published an article, "Goethe's Secret Revelation", discussing the esoteric nature of Goethe's fairy tale ''[[The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily]]''. This article led to an invitation by the Count and Countess Brockdorff to speak to a gathering of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] on the subject of Nietzsche. Steiner continued speaking regularly to the members of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]], becoming the head of its newly constituted German section in 1902 without ever formally joining the society.<ref name=RAMcD/><ref name=Ravagli/> It was also in connection with this society that Steiner met and worked with [[Marie von Sivers]], who became his second wife in 1914. By 1904, Steiner was appointed by [[Annie Besant]] to be leader of the Theosophical ''Esoteric Society'' for Germany and Austria. In 1904, Eliza, the wife of [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]], became one of his favourite scholars.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Meyer |first=Thomas |title=Helmuth von Moltke, Light for the new millennium: Rudolf Steiner's association with Helmuth and Eliza von Moltke: letters, documents and after-death communications |publisher=Rudolf Steiner Press |year=1997 |isbn=1-85584-051-0 |location=London |language=en}}</ref> Through Eliza, Steiner met Helmuth, who served as the [[German General Staff|Chief of the German General Staff]] from 1906 to 1914.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mombauer |first=Annika |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0521791014 |title=Helmuth Von Moltke and the Origins of the First World War |date=19 April 2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521019569 |language=en |access-date=1 June 2018}}</ref>

In contrast to mainstream Theosophy, Steiner sought to build a Western approach to spirituality based on the philosophical and mystical traditions of European culture. The German Section of the Theosophical Society grew rapidly under Steiner's leadership as he lectured throughout much of Europe on his [[spiritual science]]. During this period, Steiner maintained an original approach, replacing [[H. P. Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky]]'s terminology with his own, and basing his spiritual research and teachings upon the Western esoteric and philosophical tradition. This and other differences, in particular Steiner's vocal rejection of [[C. W. Leadbeater|Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant|Besant]]'s claim that [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] was the vehicle of a new ''Maitreya'', or world teacher,<ref>See Lutyens, Mary (2005). J. Krishnamurti: A Life. New Delhi: Penguin Books India. {{ISBN|0-14-400006-7}}</ref> led to a formal split in 1912–13,<ref name=RAMcD/> when Steiner and the majority of members of the German section of the Theosophical Society broke off to form a new group, the [[Anthroposophical Society]]. Steiner took the name "Anthroposophy" from the title of a work of the Austrian philosopher [[Robert von Zimmermann]], published in Vienna in 1856.<ref>Zimmermann's ''Geschichte der Aesthetik als philosophische Wissenschaft.: Anthroposophie im Umriss-Entwurf eines Systems idealer Weltansicht auf realistischer Grundlage'': Steiner, ''Anthroposophic Movement'': Lecture Two: ''The Unveiling of Spiritual Truths'', 11 June 1923.[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA258/English/RSP1993/19230611p01.html]. Steiner took the name but not the limitations on knowledge which Zimmerman proposed. Steiner, ''The Riddles of Philosophy'' (1914), Chapter VI, "Modern Idealistic World Conceptions" [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA018/English/AP1973/GA018_p02c06.html]</ref> Despite his departure from the Theosophical Society, Steiner maintained his interest in Theosophy throughout his life.<ref name="RSLib">{{Cite journal |last=Paull |first=John |year=2018 |title=The Library of Rudolf Steiner: The Books in English |journal=Journal of Social and Development Sciences |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=21–46 |doi=10.22610/jsds.v9i3.2475 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

According to Helmut Zander, Steiner's clairvoyant insights always developed according to the same pattern. He took revised texts from theosophical literature and then passed them off as his own higher insights. Because he did not want to be an occult storyteller, but a (spiritual) scientist, he adapted his reading, which he had seen supernaturally in the world's memory, to the current state of technology. When, for example, the [[Wright brothers]] began flying with gliders and eventually with motorized aircraft in 1903, Steiner transformed the ponderous gondola airships of his Atlantis story into airplanes with elevators and rudders in 1904.{{sfn|Zander|2011|pages=191ff}}

=== Anthroposophical Society and its cultural activities ===
The [[Anthroposophical Society]] grew rapidly. Fueled by a need to find an artistic home for their yearly conferences, which included performances of plays written by [[Edouard Schuré]] and Steiner, the decision was made to build a theater and organizational center. In 1913, construction began on the first [[Goetheanum]] building, in [[Dornach]], Switzerland. The building, designed by Steiner, was built to a significant part by volunteers. Steiner moved from [[Berlin]]<ref name="Berlin">Paull, John (2019) [https://www.academia.edu/41657072/Rudolf_Steiner_At_Home_in_Berlin Rudolf Steiner: At Home in Berlin], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania. 132: 26-29.</ref> to [[Dornach]] in 1913 and lived there to the end of his life.<ref name="HausHansi">Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36947843/The_Home_of_Rudolf_Steiner_Haus_Hansi The Home of Rudolf Steiner: Haus Hansi], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania, 126:19-23.</ref>

Steiner's lecture activity expanded enormously with the end of the war. Most importantly, from 1919 on Steiner began to work with other members of the society to found numerous [[#Breadth of activity|practical institutions and activities]], including the first [[Waldorf schools|Waldorf school]], founded that year in [[Stuttgart]], Germany. On New Year's Eve, 1922–1923, the Goetheanum burned to the ground; contemporary police reports indicate arson as the probable cause.<ref name=CL/>{{rp|752}}<ref name="GA259">{{Cite book |last=Rudolf Steiner |title=Das Schicksalsjahr 1923 in der Geschichte der Anthroposophischen Gesellschaft: vom Goethanumbrand zur Weihnachtstagung: Ansprachen, Versammlungen, Dokumente, Januar bis Dezember 1923 |publisher=Rudolf Steiner Verlag |year=1991 |isbn=978-3-7274-2590-5 |pages=750–790 (esp. 787)}}</ref>{{rp|796}} Steiner immediately began work designing a [[Goetheanum|second Goetheanum]] building - this time made of concrete instead of wood - which was completed in 1928, three years after his death.

At a "Foundation Meeting" for members held at the Dornach center during Christmas 1923, Steiner founded the School of Spiritual Science.<ref>Johannes Kiersch, ''A History of the School of Spiritual Science''. Publ. Temple Lodge 2006. p.xiii, {{ISBN|1902636805}}</ref> This school, which was led by Steiner, initially had sections for general anthroposophy, [[Waldorf education|education]], [[Anthroposophical medicine|medicine]], performing arts ([[eurythmy]], speech, drama and music), the literary arts and humanities, mathematics, astronomy, science, and visual arts.

=== Political engagement and social agenda ===
Steiner became a well-known and controversial public figure during and after World War I. In response to the catastrophic situation in post-war Germany, he proposed extensive social reforms through the establishment of a [[Threefold Social Order]] in which the cultural, political and economic realms would be largely independent. Steiner argued that a fusion of the three realms had created the inflexibility that had led to catastrophes such as [[First World War|World War I]]. In connection with this, he promoted a radical solution in the disputed area of [[Upper Silesia]], claimed by both Poland and Germany. His suggestion that this area be granted at least provisional independence led to his being publicly accused of being a traitor to Germany.<ref>''Frankfurter Zeitung'', 4 March 1921</ref>

Steiner opposed [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s proposal to create new European nations based around ethnic groups, which he saw as opening the door to rampant nationalism. Steiner proposed, as an alternative:

{{blockquote|'social territories' with democratic institutions that were accessible to all inhabitants of a territory whatever their origin while the needs of the various ethnicities would be met by independent cultural institutions.<ref>Uwe Werner (2011), "Rudolf Steiner zu Individuum und Rasse: Sein Engagement gegen Rassismus und Nationalismus", in ''Anthroposophie in Geschichte und Gegenwart''. trans. Margot M. Saar</ref>}}

=== Attacks, illness, and death ===
The [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] gained strength in Germany after the First World War. In 1919, a political theorist of this movement, [[Dietrich Eckart]], attacked Steiner and suggested that he was a Jew.<ref name="Werner">Uwe Werner, ''Anthroposophen in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus'', Munich (1999), p. 7.</ref> In 1921, [[Adolf Hitler]] attacked Steiner on many fronts, including accusations that he was a tool of the Jews.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hitler Attacks Rudolf Steiner |url=http://www.defendingsteiner.com/sources/hitler-steiner.php |website=www.defendingsteiner.com}}</ref> That same year, Steiner warned against the disastrous effects it would have for Central Europe if the National Socialists came to power.<ref name="Werner" />{{rp|8}} In 1922 a lecture Steiner was giving in Munich was disrupted when stink bombs were let off and the lights switched out, while people rushed the stage apparently attempting to attack Steiner, who exited safely through a back door.<ref>Rudolf Steiner, ''The Esoteric Aspect of the Social Question: The Individual and Society'', Steinerbooks, p xiv and see also Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner: Eine Biographie'', pp. 769–70</ref><ref>"Riot at Munich Lecture", New York Times, 17 May 1922.</ref> Unable to guarantee his safety, Steiner's agents cancelled his next lecture tour.<ref name=GL/>{{rp|193}}<ref>Marie Steiner, Introduction, in Rudolf Steiner, ''Turning Points in Spiritual History'', Dornach, September 1926.</ref> The 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in Munich led Steiner to give up his residence in Berlin, saying that if those responsible for the attempted coup ([[Hitler]]'s [[Nazi]] party) came to power in Germany, it would no longer be possible for him to enter the country.<ref>Wiesberger, [http://www.anthroposophy.com/aktuelles/wiesberger.html Die Krise der Anthroposophischen Gesellschaft 1923] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606014838/http://www.anthroposophy.com/aktuelles/wiesberger.html |date=6 June 2009 }}</ref>

From 1923 on, Steiner showed signs of increasing frailness and illness. He nonetheless continued to lecture widely, and even to travel; especially towards the end of this time, he was often giving two, three or even four lectures daily for courses taking place concurrently. Many of these lectures focused on practical areas of life such as education.<ref name="ReferenceA">Lindenberg, Christoph, ''Rudolf Steiner: Eine Biographie'' Vol. II, Chapter 52. {{ISBN|3-7725-1551-7}}</ref>

[[File:Rudolf Steiner Grabmal Dornach.jpg|thumb|right|Steiner's gravestone at the Goetheanum]]
Increasingly ill, he held his last lecture in late September, 1924. He continued work on his autobiography during the last months of his life; he died at Dornach on 30 March 1925.

=== Spiritual research ===
Steiner first began speaking publicly about spiritual experiences and phenomena in his 1899 lectures to the Theosophical Society. By 1901 he had begun to write about spiritual topics, initially in the form of discussions of historical figures such as the [[mysticism|mystics]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. By 1904 he was expressing his own understanding of these themes in his essays and books, while continuing to refer to a wide variety of historical sources.
{{blockquote|A world of spiritual perception is discussed in a number of writings which I have published since this book appeared. ''The Philosophy of Freedom'' forms the philosophical basis for these later writings. For it tries to show that the experience of thinking, rightly understood, is in fact an experience of spirit.<br />

Steiner's [[literary estate]] is broad. Steiner's writings, published in about forty volumes, include books, essays, [[Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas|four plays]] ('mystery dramas'), mantric verse, and an autobiography. His collected lectures, making up another approximately 300 volumes, discuss a wide range of themes. Steiner's drawings, chiefly illustrations done on blackboards during his lectures, are collected in a separate series of 28 volumes.

In 1919, [[Emil Molt]] invited him to lecture to his workers at the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart. Out of these lectures came the first Waldorf School. In 1922, Steiner presented these ideas at a conference called for this purpose in [[Oxford]] by Professor [[Millicent Mackenzie]].

A central aspect of biodynamics is that the farm as a whole is seen as an organism, and therefore should be a largely self-sustaining system, producing its own [[manure]] and [[Fodder|animal feed]]. Plant or animal disease is seen as a symptom of problems in the whole organism. Steiner also suggested timing such agricultural activities as sowing, weeding, and harvesting to utilize the influences on plant growth of the [[moon]] and [[planets]]; and the application of natural materials prepared in specific ways to the [[soil]], [[composting|compost]], and crops, with the intention of engaging non-physical beings and elemental forces.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} He encouraged his listeners to verify such suggestions [[scientific method|empirically]], as he had not yet done.<ref name="Koberwitz" />

In a 2002 newspaper editorial, Peter Treue, agricultural researcher at the [[University of Kiel]], characterized biodynamics as [[pseudoscience]] and argued that similar or equal results can be obtained using standard organic farming principles. He wrote that some biodynamic preparations more resemble [[alchemy]] or [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] akin to [[geomancy]].<ref name="treue">{{Cite web |last=Treue |first=Peter |date=13 March 2002 |title=Blut und Bohnen: Der Paradigmenwechsel im Künast-Ministerium ersetzt Wissenschaft durch Okkultismus |url=http://www.nitrogen.de/bub/faz.htm#plan |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030417075038/http://www.nitrogen.de/bub/faz.htm |archive-date=17 April 2003 |access-date=15 November 2011 |website=Die Gegenwart |publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung |language=de}} (Translation: "Blood and Beans: The paradigm shift in the Ministry of [[Renate Künast]] replaces science with occultism")</ref>

From the late 1910s, Steiner was working with doctors to create a [[Alternative medicine|new approach to medicine]]. In 1921, [[pharmacist]]s and physicians gathered under Steiner's guidance to create a pharmaceutical company called ''[[Weleda]]'' which now distributes naturopathic medical and beauty products worldwide. At around the same time, Dr. [[Ita Wegman]] founded a first anthroposophic medical clinic (now the Ita Wegman Clinic) in [[Arlesheim]].

=== Social reform===
{{main|Threefold Social Order}}
For a period after World War I, Steiner was active as a lecturer on social reform. A petition expressing his basic social ideas was widely circulated and signed by many cultural figures of the day, including [[Hermann Hesse]].

In Steiner's chief book on [[social reform]], ''Toward Social Renewal'', he suggested that the cultural, political and economic spheres of society need to work together as consciously cooperating yet independent entities, each with a particular task: political institutions should be democratic, establish [[Equality before the law|political equality]] and protect [[human rights]]; cultural institutions should nurture the free and unhindered development of science, art, education and religion; and economic institutions should enable producers, distributors, and consumers to cooperate voluntarily to provide efficiently for society's needs.<ref name="Essential">{{Cite book |last=Steiner |first=Rudolf |title=The essential Steiner : basic writings of Rudolf Steiner |date=1984 |publisher=Harper & Row |isbn=0-06-065345-0 |editor-last=McDermott |editor-first=Robert |edition=1st |location=San Francisco}}</ref> He saw this division of responsibility as a vital task which would take up consciously the historical trend toward the mutual independence of these three realms. Steiner also gave suggestions for many specific social reforms.

Steiner proposed that societal well-being fundamentally depends upon a relationship of mutuality between the individuals and the community as a whole:

{{Blockquote|The well-being of a community of people working together will be the greater, the less the individual claims for himself the proceeds of his work, i.e. the more of these proceeds he makes over to his fellow-workers, the more his own needs are satisfied, not out of his own work but out of the work done by others.|Steiner|The Fundamental Social Law<ref name="Fundamental" />}}

He expressed another aspect of this in the following motto:
{{Blockquote|The healthy social life is found <br />When in the mirror of each human soul <br />The whole community finds its reflection, <br />And when in the community <br /> The virtue of each one is living.|Steiner|The Fundamental Social Law<ref name="Fundamental">Steiner (1917), [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/FuSoLa_index.html "The Fundamental Social Law"], translated in ''Selected writings of Rudolf Steiner'' (1993), Richard Seddon (Ed.), Rudolf Steiner Press, Bristol. {{ISBN|1 85584 005 7}}</ref>}}

According to Cees Leijenhorst, "Steiner outlined his vision of a new political and social philosophy that avoids the two extremes of capitalism and socialism."<ref name="Hanegraaff Faivre van den Broek Brach 2005 p. 1090">{{Cite book |last=Leijenhorst |first=Cees |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCUOAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1090 |title=Dictionary of Gnosis & Western Esotericism: I |publisher=Brill |year=2005 |isbn=978-90-04-14187-2 |editor-last=Hanegraaff |editor-first=Wouter J. |page=1090 |quote=Steiner outlined his vision of a new political and social philosophy that avoids the two extremes of capitalism and socialism. |access-date=2 January 2024 |editor-last2=Faivre |editor-first2=Antoine |editor-last3=Broek |editor-first3=Roelof van den |editor-last4=Brach |editor-first4=Jean-Pierre}}</ref>

According to Egil Asprem, "Steiner’s teachings had a clear authoritarian ring, and developed a rather crass polemic against 'materialism', 'liberalism', and cultural 'degeneration'. [...] For example, anthroposophical medicine was developed to contrast with the 'materialistic' (and hence 'degenerate') medicine of the establishment."{{sfn|Asprem|2018|p=494}}

=== Performing arts ===
{{See also|Eurythmy}}
Steiner wrote four [[mystery plays]] between 1909 and 1913: ''The Portal of Initiation'', ''The Souls' Probation'', ''The Guardian of the Threshold'' and ''The Soul's Awakening'', modeled on the esoteric dramas of [[Edouard Schuré]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].<ref>[[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]] 'On Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas, Four Lectures Given in Spring Valley, 1948' {{ISBN|0-936132-93-0}}</ref> Steiner's plays continue to be performed by anthroposophical groups in various countries, most notably (in the original German) in Dornach, Switzerland and (in English translation) in Spring Valley, New York and in Stroud and Stourbridge in the U.K.

In collaboration with Marie von Sivers, Steiner also founded a new approach to acting, storytelling, and the recitation of poetry. His last public lecture course, given in 1924, was on speech and drama. The Russian actor, director, and acting coach [[Michael Chekhov]] based significant aspects of his method of acting on Steiner's work.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Anderson, Neil |date=June 2011 |title=On Rudolf Steiner's Impact on the Training of the Actor |url=http://ojs-prod.library.usyd.edu.au/index.php/LA/article/viewFile/5054/5759 |journal=Literature & Aesthetics |volume=21 |number=1}}{{Dead link|date=November 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Richard Solomon, [http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/solomonr2002.pdf Michael Chekhov and His Approach to Acting in Contemporary Performance Training] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803154254/http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/solomonr2002.pdf |date=3 August 2016 }}, MA thesis University of Maine, 2002</ref>

Together with [[Marie von Sivers]], Rudolf Steiner also developed the art of [[eurythmy]], sometimes referred to as "visible speech and song". According to the principles of eurythmy, there are archetypal movements or gestures that correspond to every aspect of speech – the sounds (or [[phonemes]]), the rhythms, and the grammatical function – to every "soul quality" – joy, despair, tenderness, etc. – and to every aspect of music – tones, intervals, rhythms, and harmonies.

===Esoteric schools===
{{see also|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}

Steiner was founder and leader of the following: 
* His independent ''Esoteric School'' of the Theosophical Society, founded in 1904. This school continued after the break with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] but was disbanded at the start of World War I.
* A lodge called ''Mystica Aeterna'' within the [[Ancient and Primitive Rite|Masonic Order of Memphis and Mizraim]], which Steiner led from 1906 until around 1914. Steiner added to the Masonic rite a number of Rosicrucian references.<ref>Ellic Howe: ''The Magicians of the Golden Dawn'' London 1985, Routledge, pp 262 ff</ref> 
* The School of Spiritual Science of the Anthroposophical Society, founded in 1923 as a further development of his earlier Esoteric School. This was originally constituted with a general section and seven specialized sections for education, literature, performing arts, natural sciences, medicine, visual arts, and astronomy.<ref name=GoethRestruct/><ref name="wn.rsarchive.org" /><ref>[[Elisabeth Vreede]], who Steiner had nominated as the first leader of the Mathematical-Astronomical Section, was responsible for the posthumous 1926 edition of Steiner's astronomy course, concerning this branch of natural science from the point of view of Anthroposophy and spiritual science, under the title ''The Relationship of the various Natural-Scientific Subjects to Astronomy'', [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA323/English/LR81/AstCrs_foreword.html]</ref> Steiner gave members of the School the first Lesson for guidance into the esoteric work in February 1924.{{sfn|Wachsmuth|Garber|Wannamaker|Raab|1995|p=53}} Though Steiner intended to develop three "classes" of this school, only the first of these was developed in his lifetime (and continues today). An authentic text of the written records on which the teaching of the First Class was based was published in 1992.<ref>Johannes Kiersch, ''A History of the School of Spiritual Science: The First Class'', Temple Lodge Publishing, 2006, p.xii.

=== Goethean science <!--linked from 'Goethean science'-->===
{{See also|Goethean science}}
In his commentaries on Goethe's scientific works, written between 1884 and 1897, Steiner presented Goethe's approach to science as essentially [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] in nature, rather than theory or model-based. He developed this conception further in several books, ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'' (1886) and ''Goethe's Conception of the World'' (1897), particularly emphasizing the transformation in Goethe's approach from the physical sciences, where experiment played the primary role, to plant biology, where both accurate perception and imagination were required to find the biological archetypes (''Urpflanze''). He postulated that Goethe had sought, but been unable to fully find, the further transformation in scientific thinking necessary to properly interpret and understand the animal kingdom.<ref name="Hemleben">Johannes Hemleben, ''Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography'', Henry Goulden Ltd, 1975, {{ISBN|0-904822-02-8}}, pp. 37–49 and pp. 96–100 (German edition: Rowohlt Verlag, 1990, {{ISBN|3-499-50079-5}})</ref> Steiner emphasized the role of evolutionary thinking in Goethe's discovery of the [[intermaxillary segment|intermaxillary bone]] in human beings; Goethe expected human anatomy to be an evolutionary transformation of animal anatomy.<ref name=Hemleben/> Steiner defended [[Goethe's theory of color|Goethe's qualitative description of color]] as arising synthetically from the polarity of light and darkness, in contrast to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s particle-based and analytic conception.

=== Knowledge and freedom ===
{{See also|The Philosophy of Freedom}}
Steiner approached the philosophical questions of [[epistemology|knowledge]] and [[Free will|freedom]] in two stages. In his dissertation, published in expanded form in 1892 as ''Truth and Knowledge'', Steiner suggests that there is an inconsistency between Kant's philosophy, which posits that all knowledge is a representation of an essential verity inaccessible to human consciousness, and modern science, which assumes that all influences can be found in the sensory and mental world to which we have access. Steiner considered Kant's philosophy of an inaccessible beyond ("Jenseits-Philosophy") a stumbling block in achieving a satisfying philosophical viewpoint.{{sfn|Storr|1997|p=72|ps=: "If, however, we regard the sum of all percepts as the one part and contrast with this a second part, namely the things-in-themselves, then we are philosophising into the blue. We are merely playing with concepts."}}

Steiner postulates that the world is essentially an indivisible unity, but that our [[consciousness]] divides it into the [[senses|sense]]-perceptible appearance, on the one hand, and the formal nature accessible to our [[thinking]], on the other. He sees in thinking itself an element that can be strengthened and deepened sufficiently to penetrate all that our senses do not reveal to us. Steiner thus considered what appears to human experience as a division between the spiritual and natural worlds to be a conditioned result of the structure of our consciousness, which separates [[perception]] and thinking. These two faculties give us not two worlds, but two complementary views of the same world; neither has primacy and the two together are necessary and sufficient to arrive at a complete understanding of the world. In thinking about [[perception]] (the path of natural science) and perceiving the process of thinking (the path of [[spirituality|spiritual]] training), it is possible to discover a hidden inner unity between the two poles of our experience.<ref name="Schneider" />{{rp|Chapter 4}} [[Truth]], for Steiner, is paradoxically both an objective discovery and yet "a free creation of the human spirit, that never would exist at all if we did not generate it ourselves. The task of understanding is not to replicate in conceptual form something that already exists, but rather to create a wholly new realm, that together with the world given to our senses constitutes the fullness of reality."<ref>Steiner, Rudolf, ''Truth and Science'', Preface.</ref>

In ''[[The Philosophy of Freedom]]'', Steiner further explores potentials within thinking: freedom, he suggests, can only be approached gradually with the aid of the creative activity of thinking. Thinking can be a free deed; in addition, it can liberate our will from its subservience to our [[instinct]]s and [[motivation|drive]]s. Free deeds, he suggests, are those for which we are fully conscious of the motive for our action; freedom is the spiritual activity of penetrating with consciousness our own nature and that of the world,<ref>"To be conscious of the laws underlying one's actions is to be conscious of one's freedom. The process of knowing ... is the process of development towards freedom." Steiner, GA3, pp. 91f, quoted in Rist and Schneider, p. 134</ref> and the real activity of acting in full consciousness.<ref name="Schneider" />{{rp|133–4}} This includes overcoming influences of both heredity and environment: "To be free is to be capable of thinking one's own thoughts – not the thoughts merely of the body, or of society, but thoughts generated by one's deepest, most original, most essential and spiritual self, one's individuality."<ref name=RAMcD/>

Steiner affirms [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s and [[Haeckel]]'s [[evolution]]ary perspectives but extended this beyond its [[materialism|materialistic]] consequences; he sees human [[consciousness]], indeed, all human culture, as a product of natural evolution that transcends itself. For Steiner, nature becomes self-conscious in the human being. Steiner's description of the nature of human consciousness thus closely parallels that of [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]].<ref name="Tarnas">{{Cite book |last=Tarnas |first=Richard |title=The Passion of the Western Mind |date=1996 |publisher=Random House |isbn=0-7126-7332-6 |publication-place=London}} Cf. Solovyov: "In human beings, the absolute subject-object appears ''as such'', i.e. as pure spiritual activity, containing all of its own objectivity, the whole process of its natural manifestation, but containing it totally ideally – in consciousness....The subject knows here only its own activity as an objective activity (sub specie object). Thus, the original identity of subject and object is restored in philosophical knowledge." (''The Crisis of Western Philosophy'', Lindisfarne 1996 pp. 42–3)</ref>

=== Spiritual science ===
{{See also|Anthroposophy|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}
[[File:Steiner Berlin 1900 big.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolf Steiner 1900]]
In his earliest works, Steiner already spoke of the "natural and spiritual worlds" as a unity.<ref name="GL" /> From 1900 on, he began lecturing about concrete details of the spiritual world(s), culminating in the publication in 1904 of the first of several systematic presentations, his ''Theosophy: An Introduction to the Spiritual Processes in Human Life and in the Cosmos''. As a starting point for the book Steiner took a quotation from Goethe, describing the method of natural scientific observation,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Theosophy: Chapter I: The Nature of Man |url=https://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA009/English/RSP1965/GA009_c01.html |website=wn.rsarchive.org}}</ref> while in the Preface he made clear that the line of thought taken in this book led to the same goal as that in his earlier work, ''The Philosophy of Freedom''.<ref>''Theosophy'',
from the Prefaces to the First, Second, and Third Editions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA009/English/AP1971/GA009_c01.html]</ref>

In the years 1903–1908 Steiner maintained the magazine ''Lucifer-Gnosis'' and published in it essays on topics such as initiation, reincarnation and karma, and knowledge of the supernatural world.<ref>{{Cite web |last=e.Librarian |first=The |title=Rudolf Steiner Archive: Steiner Articles Bn/GA 34 |url=https://www.rsarchive.org/Articles/GA034/ |website=www.rsarchive.org}}</ref> Some of these were later collected and published as books, such as ''How to Know Higher Worlds'' (1904–5) and ''Cosmic Memory''. The book ''An Outline of Esoteric Science'' was published in 1910. Important themes include:
* the human being as body, [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[Vitalism|spirit]];
* the path of spiritual development;
* spiritual influences on world-evolution and history; and
* [[reincarnation]] and [[karma]].

Steiner emphasized that there is an objective natural and spiritual world that can be known, and that perceptions of the spiritual world and incorporeal beings are, under conditions of training comparable to that required for the natural sciences, including self-discipline, replicable by multiple observers. It is on this basis that [[spiritual science]] is possible, with radically different epistemological foundations than those of natural science. He believed that natural science was correct in its methods but one-sided for exclusively focusing on sensory phenomena, while mysticism was vague in its methods, though seeking to explore the inner and spiritual life. Anthroposophy was meant to apply the systematic methods of the former to the content of the latter<ref>Steiner, ''Christianity as Mystical Fact and the Mysteries of Antiquity'', Anthroposophic Press 2006 {{ISBN|0880104368}}</ref><ref>One of Steiner's teachers, Franz Brentano, had famously declared that "The true method of philosophy can only be the method of natural science" (Walach, Harald, "Criticism of Transpersonal Psychology and Beyond", in The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology, ed. H. L. Friedman and G. Hartelius. P. 45.)</ref>

For Steiner, the cosmos is permeated and continually transformed by the creative activity of non-physical processes and spiritual beings. For the human being to become conscious of the objective reality of these processes and beings, it is necessary to creatively enact and reenact, within, their creative activity. Thus objective spiritual knowledge always entails creative inner activity.<ref name="GL" /> Steiner articulated three stages of any creative deed:<ref name="Schneider" />{{rp|Pt II, Chapter 1}}
* Moral intuition: the ability to discover or, preferably, develop valid ethical principles;
* Moral imagination: the imaginative transformation of such principles into a concrete intention applicable to the particular situation ([[situational ethics]]); and
* Moral technique: the realization of the intended transformation, depending on a mastery of practical skills.

Steiner termed his work from this period onwards ''[[Anthroposophy]]''. He emphasized that the spiritual path he articulated builds upon and supports individual freedom and independent [[judgment]]; for the results of spiritual research to be appropriately presented in a modern context they must be in a form accessible to [[logic]]al understanding, so that those who do not have access to the spiritual experiences underlying anthroposophical research can make independent evaluations of the latter's results.<ref name="Schneider">Peter Schneider, ''Einführung in die Waldorfpädagogik'', {{ISBN|3-608-93006-X}}</ref> Spiritual training is to support what Steiner considered the overall purpose of human evolution, the development of the mutually interdependent qualities of love and [[free will|freedom]].<ref name="RAMcD">{{Cite book |last=McDermott |first=Robert A. |title=Modern Esoteric Spirituality |date=1995 |publisher=Crossroad Publishing |isbn=978-0-8245-1444-0 |editor-last=Faivre |editor-first=Antoine |publication-place=New York |pages=299–301; 288ff |chapter=Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy |editor-last2=Needleman |editor-first2=Jacob |editor-last3=Voss |editor-first3=Karen}}</ref>

=== Steiner and Christianity ===
Steiner appreciated the ritual of the mass he experienced while serving as an altar boy from school age until he was ten years old, and this experience remained memorable for him as a genuinely spiritual one, contrasting with his irreligious family life.<ref name="Steiner 1982 pp. 31-32">{{Cite book |last=Steiner |first=Rudolf |url=https://archive.org/details/rudolf-steiner-ga-028/page/n30/mode/1up |title=Mein Lebensgang : eine nicht vollendete autobiographie, mit einem nachwort |last2=Steiner |first2=Marie |publisher=Rudolf Steiner |year=1982 |isbn=9783727402807 |location=Dornach, Schweiz |pages=31–32 |language=de |oclc=11145259 |orig-year=1925}}</ref> As a young adult, Steiner had no formal connection to organized religion. In 1899, he experienced what he described as a life-transforming inner encounter with the being of Christ. Steiner was then 38, and the experience of meeting Christ occurred after a tremendous inner struggle. To use Steiner's own words, the "experience culminated in my standing in the spiritual presence of the Mystery of [[Calvary|Golgotha]] in a most profound and solemn festival of knowledge."<ref>Autobiography, Chapters in the Course of My Life: 18611907, Rudolf Steiner, SteinerBooks, 2006</ref> His relationship to Christianity thereafter remained entirely founded upon personal experience, and thus both non-denominational and strikingly different from conventional religious forms.<ref name=RAMcD/>

==== Christ and human evolution ====
Steiner describes Christ as the unique pivot and meaning of earth's evolutionary processes and human history, redeeming [[The Fall of Man|the Fall]] from [[Paradise]].<ref name="Willmann">{{Cite journal |last=Willmann |first=Carlo |year=2001 |title=Waldorfpädagogik: Theologische und religionspädagogische Befunde |journal=Kölner Veröffentlichungen zur Religionsgeschichte |language=de |publisher=Böhlau |publication-place=Köln Weimar Wien |volume=27 |isbn=978-3-412-16700-4 |issn=0030-9230 |postscript=Especially chapters 1.3, 1.4.}}</ref> He understood the Christ as a being that unifies and inspires all religions, not belonging to a particular religious faith. To be "Christian" is, for Steiner, a search for balance between polarizing extremes<ref name="Willmann" />{{rp|102–3}} and the ability to manifest love in freedom.<ref name=RAMcD/>

Central principles of his understanding include:
*The being of Christ is central to ''all'' religions, though called by different names by each.
*Every religion is valid and true for the time and cultural context in which it was born.
*Historical forms of Christianity need to be transformed in our times in order to meet the ongoing evolution of humanity.

In Steiner's [[esoteric cosmology]], the spiritual development of humanity is interwoven in and inseparable from the cosmological development of the universe. Continuing the evolution that led to humanity being born out of the natural world, the Christ being brings an impulse enabling human consciousness of the forces that act creatively, but unconsciously, in nature.<ref>An Outline of Esoteric Science, Anthroposophic, SteinerBooks, 1997</ref>

==== Divergence from conventional Christian thought ====
Steiner's views of Christianity diverge from conventional Christian thought in key places, and include [[gnostic]] elements.<ref name=Hemleben/> However, unlike many gnostics, Steiner affirms the unique and actual physical Incarnation of Christ in Jesus at the beginning of the Christian era.

One of the central points of divergence with conventional Christian thought is found in [[Anthroposophy#Nature of the human being|Steiner's views on reincarnation and karma]].

Steiner also posited two different Jesus children involved in the Incarnation of the Christ: one child descended from [[Solomon]], as described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]; the other child from [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], as described in the [[Gospel of Luke]].<ref name="Essential" /><ref name="aspremthesis" /><ref name="x337">{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Marshall D. |title=The Purpose of the Biblical Genealogies with Special Reference to the Setting of the Genealogies of Jesus |date=1969 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-07317-2 |editor-last=Black |editor-first=Matthew |publication-place=London |page=144}}</ref> He references in this regard the fact that the [[genealogy|genealogies]] in these two gospels list twenty-six (Luke) to forty-one (Matthew) completely different ancestors for the generations from [[King David|David]] to Jesus.

Steiner's view of the [[second coming]] of Christ is also unusual. He suggested that this would not be a physical reappearance, but rather, meant that the Christ being would become manifest in non-physical form, in the "[[Etheric plane|etheric]] realm" – i.e. visible to spiritual vision and apparent in community life – for increasing numbers of people, beginning around the year 1933. He emphasized that the future would require humanity to recognize this Spirit of Love in all its genuine forms, regardless of how this is named. He also warned that the traditional name, "Christ", might be used, yet the true essence of this Being of Love be ignored.<ref name=Hemleben/>

It can be noted that insiders routinely deny that Anthroposophy is a religion and prefer to characterise it as, for example, a philosophical perspective or a form of science.

==== The Christian Community ====
In the 1920s, Steiner was approached by [[Friedrich Rittelmeyer]], a [[Lutheran]] pastor with a congregation in Berlin, who asked if it was possible to create a more modern form of Christianity. Soon others joined Rittelmeyer – mostly Protestant pastors and theology students, but including several Roman Catholic priests. Steiner offered counsel on renewing the spiritual potency of the sacraments while emphasizing [[freedom of thought]] and a personal relationship to religious life. He envisioned a new synthesis of Catholic and Protestant approaches to religious life, terming this "modern, [[Johannine Christianity]]".<ref name="Essential" />

The resulting movement for religious renewal became known as "[[The Christian Community]]". Its work is based on a free relationship to Christ without dogma or policies. Its priesthood, which is open to both men and women, is free to preach out of their own spiritual insights and creativity.

Steiner emphasized that the resulting movement for the renewal of Christianity was a personal gesture of help to a movement founded by Rittelmeyer and others independently of his anthroposophical work.<ref name="Essential" /> The distinction was important to Steiner because he sought with Anthroposophy to create a scientific, not [[faith]]-based, spirituality.<ref name="Willmann" /> He recognized that for those who wished to find more traditional forms, however, a renewal of the traditional religions was also a vital need of the times.

=== Scientism ===
{{see also|Anthroposophy#Scientific_basis|l1=Anthroposophy: Scientific basis}}
[[Olav Hammer]] has criticized as [[scientism]] Steiner's claim to use scientific methodology to investigate spiritual phenomena that were based upon his claims of [[clairvoyant]] experience.<ref name=Hammer/> Steiner regarded the observations of spiritual research as more dependable (and above all, consistent) than observations of physical reality. However, he did consider spiritual research to be fallible,<ref name="Zander2">Helmut Zander, ''Anthroposophie in Deutschland'', Göttingen, 2007, {{ISBN|3-525-55452-4}}.</ref>{{rp|p. 618}} and held the view that anyone capable of thinking logically was in a position to correct errors by spiritual researchers.<ref>Steiner: "It may even happen that a researcher who has the power of perception in supersensible realms may fall into error in his logical presentation, and that someone who has no supersensible perception, but who has the capacity for sound thinking, may correct him."[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA013/English/AP1972/GA013_c04-01.html Occult Science, Chapter IV]</ref>

=== Race and ethnicity===
<!-- this section is linked from [[Waldorf education]]--> 

Rudolf Steiner was an extreme pan-German nationalist, and never disavowed such stance.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Zegers |first=Peter |last2=Staudenmaier |first2=Peter |date=9 January 2009 |orig-date=2000 |title=Anthroposophy and its Defenders |url=https://social-ecology.org/wp/2009/01/anthroposophy-and-its-defenders-2/ |journal=Humanist |publisher=Institute for Social Ecology |issue=4}}</ref>

Steiner's work includes both universalist, humanist elements and racial assumptions.{{sfn|Staudenmaier|2008}} Due to the contrast and even contradictions between these elements, one commentator argues: "whether a given reader interprets Anthroposophy as racist or not depends upon that reader's concerns".<ref name="Zander">"Es hängt dabei von den Interessen der Leser ab, ob die Anthroposophie rassistisch interpretiert wird oder nicht." Helmut Zander, "Sozialdarwinistische Rassentheorien aus dem okkulten Untergrund des Kaiserreichs", in Puschner et al., Handbuch zur "Völkischen Bewegung" 1871–1918: 1996.</ref> Steiner considered that by dint of its shared language and culture, each people has a unique essence, which he called its soul or spirit.<ref name=Hammer/> He saw race as a physical manifestation of humanity's spiritual evolution, and at times discussed race in terms of complex hierarchies that were largely derived from 19th century [[scientific racism|biology]], [[Historical race concepts|anthropology]], philosophy and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]. However, he consistently and explicitly subordinated race, ethnicity, gender, and indeed all hereditary factors, to individual factors in development.<ref name=Zander/> For Steiner, human individuality is centered in a person's unique biography, and he believed that an individual's experiences and development are not bound by a single lifetime or the qualities of the physical body.<ref name="Ravagli">Lorenzo Ravagli, ''Zanders Erzählungen'', Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-8305-1613-2}}, pp. 184f</ref>

Steiner occasionally characterized specific [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]s, nations and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] in ways that have been deemed [[racist]] by critics.<ref>Arno Frank, "Einschüchterung auf Waldorf-Art", ''Die Tageszeitung'' 4 August 2000.</ref> This includes descriptions by him of certain races and ethnic groups as flowering, others as backward, or destined to degenerate or disappear.<ref name=Zander/> He presented explicitly hierarchical views of the spiritual evolution of different races,<ref name="Treitel 2004 p. ">{{Cite book |last=Treitel |first=Corinna |title=A Science for the Soul |date=2004-04-20 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=0-8018-7812-8 |publication-place=Baltimore |page=103}}</ref> including—at times, and inconsistently—portraying the [[white race]], [[European culture]] or Germanic culture as representing the high point of human [[evolution]] as of the early 20th century, although he did describe them as destined to be superseded by future cultures.<ref name=Zander/>

Throughout his life Steiner consistently emphasized the core spiritual unity of all the world's peoples and sharply criticized racial prejudice. He articulated beliefs that the individual nature of any person stands higher than any racial, ethnic, national or religious affiliation.<ref name="CL" /><ref name="Essential" /><!--CL, p.55--> His belief that race and [[ethnicity]] are transient and superficial, and not essential aspects of the individual,<ref name=Zander/> was partly rooted in his conviction that each individual [[reincarnation|reincarnates]] in a variety of different peoples and races over successive lives, and that each of us thus bears within him or herself the heritage of many races and peoples.<ref name=Zander/><ref name="Kugler Baur 2007 p.

In the context of his ethical individualism, Steiner considered "race, folk, ethnicity and gender" to be general, describable categories into which individuals may choose to fit, but from which free human beings can and will liberate themselves.<ref name=Ravagli/>

Marie Steiner-von Sivers, Guenther Wachsmuth, and Albert Steffen, had publicly expressed sympathy for the Nazi regime since its beginnings; led by such sympathies of their leadership, the Swiss and German Anthroposophical organizations chose for a path conflating accommodation with collaboration, which in the end ensured that while the Nazi regime hunted the esoteric organizations, Gentile Anthroposophists from Nazi Germany and countries occupied by it were let be to a surprising extent.{{sfn|Staudenmaier|2014|pp=103-106}} Of course they had some setbacks from the enemies of Anthroposophy among the upper echelons of the Nazi regime, but Anthroposophists also had loyal supporters among them, so overall Gentile Anthroposophists were not badly hit by the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Staudenmaier|2014|pp=103-106}}
