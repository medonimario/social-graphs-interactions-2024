'''Angela Yvonne Davis''' (born January 26, 1944) is an American [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] political activist, philosopher, academic, and author. She is Distinguished Professor Emerita of Feminist Studies and [[History of Consciousness]] at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Directory: Angela Y Davis |url=https://humanities.ucsc.edu/academics/faculty/index.php?uid=aydavis |website=UC Santa Cruz |access-date=17 August 2024}}</ref> Davis was a longtime member of the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) and a founding member of the [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]] (CCDS). She was active in movements such as the [[Occupy movement]] and the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign.

Davis was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; she studied at [[Brandeis University]] and the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]], where she became increasingly engaged in [[far-left politics]]. She also studied at the [[University of California, San Diego]], before moving to [[East Germany]], where she completed some studies for a doctorate at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. After returning to the United States, she joined the CPUSA and became involved in the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]] and the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|campaign against the Vietnam War]].

In 1969, she was hired as an assistant professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). UCLA's governing [[Regents of the University of California|Board of Regents]] soon fired her due to her membership in the CPUSA. After a court ruled the firing illegal, the university fired her for the use of inflammatory language. In 1970, guns belonging to Davis were used in an [[Marin County Civic Center attacks|armed takeover of a courtroom in Marin County]], California, in which four people were killed. Prosecuted for three capital felonies—including conspiracy to murder—she was held in jail for over a year before being acquitted of all charges in 1972.

During the 1980s, Davis was twice the Communist Party's candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. In 1997, she co-founded [[Critical Resistance]], an organization working to abolish the [[prison–industrial complex]]. In 1991, amid the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], she broke away from the CPUSA to help establish the [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism|CCDS]]. That same year, she joined the [[Women's studies|feminist studies]] department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she became department director before retiring in 2008.

Davis has received various awards, including the Soviet Union's [[Lenin Peace Prize]] and induction into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Davis, Angela |url=https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/angela-davis/ |website=National Women's Hall of Fame |access-date=May 14, 2020 |archive-date=August 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200818022932/https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/angela-davis/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Due to accusations that she advocates [[political violence]] and due to her support of the Soviet Union,<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 23, 2019 |title=The Real Stain on Angela Davis' Legacy Is Her Support for Tyranny |url=https://thebulwark.com/the-real-stain-on-angela-davis-legacy-is-her-support-for-tyranny/ |website=The Bulwark |access-date=July 28, 2020 |archive-date=July 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728182910/https://thebulwark.com/the-real-stain-on-angela-davis-legacy-is-her-support-for-tyranny/ |url-status=live }}</ref> she has been a controversial figure.

==Early life==
Angela Davis was born on January 26, 1944,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/individuals/angela-davis |title=Angela Davis (January 26, 1944) |website=African American Heritage |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |access-date=January 24, 2020 |archive-date=December 25, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201225030805/https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/individuals/angela-davis |url-status=live }}</ref> in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].

Davis occasionally spent time on her uncle's farm and with friends in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Yvonne|title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography|date=March 1989|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York City|isbn=0-7178-0667-7|chapter=Rocks}}</ref> Her siblings include two brothers, [[Ben Davis (American football)|Ben]] and Reginald, and a sister, Fania.

Davis attended Carrie A. Tuggle School, a segregated black elementary school, and later, Parker Annex, a middle-school branch of [[A. H. Parker High School|Parker High School]] in Birmingham. During this time, Davis's mother, Sallye Bell Davis, was a national officer and leading organizer of the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]], an organization influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] aimed at building alliances among African Americans in the South. Davis grew up surrounded by communist organizers and thinkers, who significantly influenced her intellectual development.<ref name="Interview-Angela Davis">{{cite journal|last=Kum-Kum Bhavnani|first=Bhavnani|author2=Davis, Angela|title=Complexity, Activism, Optimism: An Interview with Angela Y.

Burnham]], whose daughter [[Margaret Burnham]] was Davis's friend from childhood, as well as her co-counsel during Davis's 1971 trial for murder and kidnapping.<ref name=abt/>

Davis was involved in her church youth group as a child and attended Sunday school regularly. She attributes much of her political involvement to her involvement with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts of the United States of America]]. She also participated in the Girl Scouts 1959 [[Girl Scout Senior Roundup|national roundup]] in [[Colorado]]. As a Girl Scout, she marched and picketed to protest racial segregation in Birmingham.<ref>"The Radicalization of Angela Davis," ''Ebony'', July 1971: n.p., Mag.</ref>

By her junior year of high school, Davis had been accepted by an [[American Friends Service Committee]] (Quaker) program that placed black students from the South in [[Racial integration|integrated]] schools in the North. She chose [[Elisabeth Irwin High School]] in [[Greenwich Village]]. There she was recruited by a communist youth group, Advance.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bubbins|first=Harry|date=January 26, 2018|title=Angela Davis: Her Greenwich Village Connections|url=https://www.villagepreservation.org/2018/01/26/happy-birthday-angela-davis-2/|access-date=October 21, 2020|website=Village Preservation|language=en-US|archive-date=October 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201024100927/https://www.villagepreservation.org/2018/01/26/happy-birthday-angela-davis-2/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Education==

===Brandeis University===
Davis was awarded a scholarship to [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], [[Massachusetts]], where she was one of three black students in her class. She encountered the [[Frankfurt School]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] at a rally during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and became his student. In a 2007 television interview, Davis said, "Herbert Marcuse taught me that it was possible to be an academic, an activist, a scholar, and a revolutionary."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2007/aug/23/bourgeois-marxist|title=The Bourgeois Marxist|author=Barbarella Fokos|publisher=sandiegoreader.com|date=August 23, 2007|access-date=October 21, 2010|archive-date=March 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331175944/https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2007/aug/23/bourgeois-marxist/|url-status=live}}</ref> She worked part-time to earn enough money to travel to France and Switzerland and attended the eighth [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in [[Helsinki, Finland|Helsinki]]. She returned home in 1963 to a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] interview about her attendance at the communist-sponsored festival.<ref name="Waters">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Yvonne|title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography|date=March 1989|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York City|isbn=0-7178-0667-7|chapter=Waters}}</ref>

During her second year at Brandeis, Davis decided to major in French and continued her study of philosopher and writer [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. She was accepted by the [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] Junior Year in France Program. Classes were initially at [[Biarritz]] and later at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In Paris, she and other students lived with a French family. She was in Biarritz when she learned of the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Birmingham church bombing]], committed by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], in which four black girls were killed; she had been personally acquainted with the victims.<ref name="Waters"/>

While completing her degree in French, Davis realized that her primary area of interest was philosophy. She was particularly interested in Marcuse's ideas. On returning to Brandeis, she sat in on his course. She wrote in her autobiography that Marcuse was approachable and helpful. She began making plans to attend the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] for [[Graduate school|graduate work]] in philosophy. In 1965, she graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'', a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name="Waters"/>

===University of Frankfurt===
[[File:Angela_Davis_at_Goethe_University_in_Frankfurt,_Germany.tif|thumb|180px|As a student at the Institute of Social Research at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Goethe University]] in [[Frankfurt]], Germany. Davis studied the work of philosophers [[Kant]], [[Hegel]], and [[Adorno]]]] In [[West Germany]], with a monthly stipend of $100, she lived first with a German family and later with a group of students in a loft in an old factory. After visiting [[East Berlin]] during the annual [[May Day#Germany|May Day celebration]], she felt that the [[East Germany|East German]] government was dealing better with the residual effects of [[fascism]] than were the West Germans. Many of her roommates were active in the radical [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student Union]] (SDS), and Davis participated in some SDS actions. Events in the United States, including the formation of the [[Black Panther Party]] and the transformation of [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) to an all-black organization, drew her interest upon her return.<ref name="Waters" />

===Postgraduate work===
Marcuse had moved to a position at the [[University of California, San Diego]], and Davis followed him there after her two years in [[Frankfurt]].<ref name="Waters"/> Davis traveled to London to attend a conference on "The Dialectics of Liberation". The black contingent at the conference included the Trinidadian-American<!-- description per his own article --> [[Stokely Carmichael]] and the British [[Michael X]]. Although moved by Carmichael's rhetoric, Davis was reportedly disappointed by her colleagues' [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] sentiments and their rejection of communism as a "white man's thing".<ref name=":2">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Yvonne|title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography|date=March 1989|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York City|isbn=0-7178-0667-7|chapter=Flames}}</ref>

Davis had befriended George and Jonathan Jackson doing work attempting to free the Soledad Brothers. She had communicated frequently with George Jackson over letters and worked extensively with Jonathan Jackson in her work with the Soledad Brothers Defense Committee. Davis became a mentor and teacher to George Jackson who wrote that he believed that women should never be allowed to express an opinion but should quietly listen to men.<ref>Paris Review 2015 Max Nelson</ref> Jackson also held the opinion that if a woman couldn't find a man to marry her she should become a prostitute.<ref>The New Yorker 2014 Jeffrey Toobin</ref> She had grown close with the Jackson family in general during this time while working with them and speaking at events together.<ref name=":2" />

As California considers "all persons concerned in the commission of a crime,&nbsp;... whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense, or aid and abet in its commission,&nbsp;... are principals in any crime so committed", Davis was charged with "aggravated kidnapping and first degree murder in the death of Judge Harold Haley", and Marin County Superior Court Judge Peter Allen Smith issued a warrant for her arrest. Hours after the judge issued the warrant on August 14, 1970, a massive attempt to find and arrest Davis began. On August 18, four days after the warrant was issued, the FBI director [[J.

Across the nation, thousands  began organizing a movement to gain her release. In New York City, black writers formed a committee called the Black People in Defense of Angela Davis. By February 1971, more than 200 local committees in the United States, and 67 in foreign countries, worked to free Davis from jail.
