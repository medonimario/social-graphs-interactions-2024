'''Hasdai ben Abraham Crescas''' ({{IPA|ca|həzˈðaj ˈβeɲ ʒuˈða ˈkɾeskəs|lang}}; {{langx|he|חסדאי קרשקש}}; c. 1340 in [[Barcelona]] – 1410/11 in [[Zaragoza]]) was a [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish-Jewish]] [[philosopher]] and a renowned [[halakhist]] (teacher of Jewish law).  Along with [[Maimonides]] ("Rambam"), [[Gersonides]] ("Ralbag"), and [[Joseph Albo]], he is known as one of the major practitioners of the [[rationalism|rationalist]] approach to [[Jewish philosophy]].<ref>Kohler, Kaufmann, and Hirsch, Emil G.

==Biography==
[[Image:Call de Barcelona Marlet.jpg|thumb|right|Carrer Marlet, in the old [[Jewish Quarter (diaspora)|Jewish Quarter]] of Barcelona, where Crescas was born. The ''Sinagoga Major'' is on the left.]]
Hasdai Crescas came from a family of scholars. He was the grandson of the [[Talmud]]ist Hasdai ben Judah Crescas, and a disciple of the Talmudist and philosopher [[Nissim of Gerona|Nissim ben Reuben]], known as the ''RaN''. Following in the footsteps of his teacher he became a Talmudic authority and a philosopher of great originality. He is considered important in the history of modern thought for his deep influence on [[Baruch Spinoza]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Durant |first1=Will |title=The Story of Philosophy |date=1926 |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-671-73916-6 |page=149}}</ref>

After leaving Barcelona, he held the administrative position of [[crown rabbi (Iberia)|crown rabbi]] in [[Aragon]].<ref name="Berlin-2011">{{cite book |last1=Berlin |first1=Adele |author-link1=Adele Berlin |last2=Himelstein |first2=Shmuel |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC  |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford; New York |isbn=978-0-19-973004-9 |chapter=Crown Rabbi |edition=2nd |access-date=31 May 2015 |year=2011}} p. 194</ref>  He seems to have been active as a teacher. Among his fellow students and friends, [[Isaac ben Sheshet]] (known as the ''RIBaSH''), famous for his [[responsa]], takes precedence. [[Joseph Albo]] is the best known of his pupils, but at least two others have won recognition, Rabbi Mattathias of Saragossa, and Rabbi Zechariah ha-Levi.

Crescas was a man of means. As such he was appointed sole executor of the will of his uncle Vitalis Azday by the [[John I of Aragon|King John I of Aragon]] in 1393. Still, though enjoying the high esteem even of prominent non-Jews, he did not escape the common fate of his coreligionists. Imprisoned with his teacher upon a false accusation of [[host desecration]] in 1378, he suffered personal indignities because he was a Jew. His only son died in a [[Massacre of 1391|massacre in Barcelona in 1391]], a martyr for his faith, during the [[Anti-Judaism|anti-Judaic persecutions]] of that period. Nevertheless, he kept his faith.

Notwithstanding this bereavement, his mental powers were unbroken; for the works that have made him famous were written after that terrible year.  In 1401-02 he visited [[Joseph Orabuena]] at Pamplona at the request of the [[Charles III of Navarre|King of Navarre]], who paid the expenses of his journey to various Navarrese towns (Jacobs, l.c. Nos. 1570, 1574). He was at that time described as "Rav of [[Zaragoza|Saragossa]]."

==Works==
His works on Jewish law, if indeed ever committed to writing – have not reached us. But his concise philosophical work ''Or Adonai'', ''The Light of the Lord'' became a classical Jewish refutation of medieval [[Aristotelianism]], and a harbinger of the scientific revolution in the 16th century.

Three of his writings have been preserved:
#His primary work, ''[[Or Adonai]]'', ''The Light of the Lord''.
#An exposition and refutation of the main doctrines of Christianity. This treatise was written in Catalan in 1398. The Catalan original is no longer extant; but a Hebrew translation by [[Joseph ibn Shem-Tov]], with the title  ("Refutation of the Cardinal Principles of the Christians"), has been preserved. The work was composed at the solicitation of Spanish noblemen. Crescas' object in writing what is virtually an apologetic treatise on Judaism was to present the reasons which held the Jews fast to their ancestral faith.
#His letter to the congregations of Avignon, published as an appendix to Wiener's edition of "Shevet Yehudah" (see above), in which he relates the incidents of the persecution of 1391.
