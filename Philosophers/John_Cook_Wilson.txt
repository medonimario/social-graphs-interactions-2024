'''John Cook Wilson''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (6 June 1849 – 11 August 1915) was an English philosopher, [[Wykeham Professor of Logic]] and Fellow of [[New College, Oxford|New College]].

==Early life and career==
John Cook Wilson was born in [[Nottingham]], England, in 1849.<ref name="SE">{{Cite web |last=Marion |first=Mathieu |date=2022 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |title=John Cook Wilson |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2022/entries/wilson/ |access-date=2023-01-22 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref> He was the son of James Wilson, a Methodist minister.<ref name="DMBI" /> After studying at [[Derby School|Derby Grammar School]], 1862–67, Cook Wilson went up with a scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]]<ref name="NATURE">{{Cite journal |date=1915-08-01 |title=The Late Prof. J.

W. Chandler]] and Mathematics under [[Henry John Stephen Smith|H. J. S. Smith]].{{CN|date=January 2023}} He graduated with a double 'double-first', gaining both firsts in Mathematical (1869) and Classical Moderations (1870), and then firsts in Mathematics (1871) and Literae Humaniores or 'Greats' (1872).{{CN|date=January 2023}}  He received the [[Conington Prize]] in 1882.<ref name="NATURE" />  He studied logic under [[Hermann Lotze]] in  Göttingen.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lotze, RudolPH Hermann|url=https://iep.utm.edu/lotze/ |access-date=2023-01-23 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Cook Wilson became a Fellow of [[Oriel College, Oxford]] in 1873, and he was elected Wykeham Professor of Logic in 1889,<ref name="SE" /> eventually becoming a Fellow of [[New College, Oxford|New College]] in 1901 and remaining there until his death. In his inaugural lecture, ''On an Evolutionist Theory of the Axioms'' (a critique of Herbert Spencer's philosophy published in 1889), he acknowledged his intellectual debt to Green and Lotze.{{CN|date=January 2023}} The bulk of Cook Wilson's publications were, however, in Classics and in Mathematics.

==Classics and mathematics==
In Classics Cook Wilson published over 50 papers and book-length studies on Aristotle’s ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and on Plato’s ''Timaeus.''<ref name="SE" />

==Philosophy==
Cook Wilson believed that "the (printed) letter killeth, and it is extraordinary how it will prevent the acutest from exercising their wonted clearness of vision" (SI, p. 872),<ref>{{Cite web |last=Beaney |first=Michael |title=Collingwood's Critique of OxbridgeRealism |url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/46779178/Critique_of_OR_29July2010.pdf |access-date=2023-01-23}}</ref> and so naturally refrained from publishing his philosophical views, printing instead for private circulation  pamphlets known as ''Dictata'', from which his student [[A. S. L. Farquharson]] assembled, along with some letters, the volumes of ''Statement and Inference'' after his death. 

Belonging to a generation brought up in the atmosphere of [[British idealism]], he espoused the cause of [[direct realism]]. His posthumous collected papers, ''Statement and Inference'' (a defence of direct realism),<ref>Michael Beaney (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of the History of Analytic Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 40.</ref> were influential on a generation of [[Oxford]] philosophers, including [[H. H. Price]] and [[Gilbert Ryle]]. He also features prominently in the work of [[J. L. Austin]], [[John McDowell]], and [[Timothy Williamson]]. [[P. F. Strawson]]'s expression, "the attributive tie", in ''Individuals'' (1959, 168) is named "in memory of Cook Wilson".

Cook Wilson often argued for the existence of God as an experiential reality. He is quoted saying 'We don't want merely inferred friends, could we be satisfied with an inferred God?'<ref name="GRA">{{Cite book |last=Henry |first=Carl F.
