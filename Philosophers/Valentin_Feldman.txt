{{Short description|French philosopher and Marxist of Jewish-Russian origin}}
'''Valentin Feldman''' (23 June 1909 – 27 July 1942) was a [[French philosopher]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] of Jewish-Russian origin. In 1942, he was murdered by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Occupation of France]].

Born in [[Saint Petersburg]], he left the [[USSR]] in 1922 at the end of the Civil War. He settled in Paris and studied at the [[Lycée Henri IV]] and the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] University. A pupil of French philosopher [[Victor Basch]], he worked on [[aesthetics]] and wrote an essay, ''L'Esthétique française contemporaine'' (''French contemporan aesthetic''), Félix Alcan, 1936.

Involved in public activities as a teacher of philosophy, he supported as an antifascist the [[Front populaire]] and the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1937. Among his friends were [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Gaston Bachelard]] and [[Georges Politzer]]. In September 1939, he volunteered for the [[French Army]] despite suffering from a heart condition. Mobilized as a soldier in [[Rethel]], he began to write his ''Journal de guerre'' in January 1940 in the middle of the [[Phoney War]]. He survived several air attacks and bombardments during the [[Fall of France]] (May–June 1940).<ref>Valentin Feldman, ''Journal de guerre, 1940-1941'', Farrago, 2006, p. 175.</ref>

Under the [[German Occupation]] he was a teacher in [[Dieppe]] but suffered from the first [[law on the status of Jews]] (October 1940). He was finally excluded from teaching in July 1941. By that time, he was already active in the [[French Resistance]]. From 1940, he was liaison officer between Dieppe, [[Rouen]] and [[Paris]]. After a year, he wrote the texts against the collaborationist [[Vichy regime]] and the Germans in the clandestine newspaper ''L'Avenir normand'' in Dieppe, and wrote several texts for the clandestine Parisian review ''[[La Pensée libre]]'', supervised by [[Georges Politzer]], [[Jacques Decour]] and [[Jacques Solomon]]. Becoming part of the underground, he joined a group of communist Resistance in Rouen, where he participated in actions against the German occupiers.

Arrested in February 1942 after the sabotage of a factory, he was imprisoned and tortured. Judged in Paris, he was condemned to death by a German military tribunal. He refused to sign his appeal for a reprieve. Feldman was executed by a firing squad on 27 July 1942. Addressing the German soldiers just before the salvo, he called out to them: "Imbeciles, it is for you that I die!

His last words inspired numerous French writers: [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Aragon]] were among them.<ref>Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Cahiers pour une morale'', Gallimard, 1983, p. 212; Louis Aragon, ''L'Homme communiste'', Gallimard, 1946, p. 42.</ref> French-Swiss film-maker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] dedicated a short film to him, ''The Last Word'' (1988).
