[[File:顏元.jpg|thumb|220px|Yan Yuan's portrait]]

'''Yan Yuan''' ({{zh|c=颜元|p=Yán Yuán|w=Yen Yuan}}; 1635 - 1704), [[courtesy name]] '''Yizhi''' or '''Hunran''', [[art name]] '''Xizhai''' ({{zh|c=习斋|p=Xízhāi|w=Hsi-chai}}) 
was a Chinese classicist, essayist, and philosopher. He founded the practical school of [[Confucianism]] to contrast with the more ethereal [[Neo-Confucianism]] that had been popular in [[China]] for the previous six centuries.  Like the [[Han learning]] scholars, he rejected the abstract metaphysics of the Neo-Confucians.  However, he considered Han learning as too obsessed with philology and textual criticism and not enough emphasis on pragmatism.  His school promoted the [[Six Arts]].

He was born on April 27, 1635, in the Zhili province (now called [[Hebei]]) in China and spent his youth in poverty, after his father was taken into the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] army and never returned. He died on September 30, 1704, in the same province.

The ideas of Yan Yuan were developed by his disciple Li Gong [[:zh:李塨]] (Yan-Li school). 

Yan's intellectual heritage was addressed by [[Wu Han (historian)|Wu Han]] in the 20th century. Wu elaborated on the Yan's concept of the relation between history and the present.
