'''Giordano Bruno''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ɔr|ˈ|d|ɑː|n|oʊ|_|ˈ|b|r|uː|n|oʊ}}; {{IPA|it|dʒorˈdaːno ˈbruːno|lang}}; {{langx|la|Iordanus Brunus Nolanus}}; born '''Filippo Bruno''', January or February 1548 – 17 February 1600) was an Italian [[philosopher]], [[poet]], [[alchemist]], [[astrologer]], [[cosmological]] theorist, and [[esotericist]].{{sfn|Gatti|2002|p=1}}<ref>Pogge, Richard W. "The Folly of Giordano Bruno". Ohio State University Department of Astronomy. Updated February 24, 2014. http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Essays/Bruno.html</ref> He is known for his cosmological theories, which conceptually extended to include the then-novel [[Copernican model]]. He practiced [[Hermeticism]] and gave a mystical stance to exploring the universe. He proposed that the stars were distant suns surrounded by their own planets ([[exoplanet]]s), and he raised the possibility that these planets might foster life of their own, a cosmological position known as [[cosmic pluralism]]. He also insisted that the universe is [[infinity|infinite]] and could have no center.

Bruno was tried for [[Christian heresy|heresy]] by the [[Roman Inquisition]] on charges of denial of several core Catholic doctrines, including [[Hell|eternal damnation]], the [[Trinity]], the [[Christology|divinity of Christ]], the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|virginity of Mary]], and [[transubstantiation]]. Bruno's [[pantheism]] was not taken lightly by the church,{{sfnm|1a1=Birx|1y=1997|2a1=Collinge|2y=2012|2p=[https://archive.org/details/historicaldictio0000coll_2ndedi/page/188 188]}} nor was his teaching of [[metempsychosis]] regarding the [[reincarnation]] of the [[soul]]. The [[Inquisition]] found him guilty, and he was [[burned at the stake]] in Rome's [[Campo de' Fiori]] in 1600. After his death, he gained considerable fame, being particularly celebrated by 19th- and early 20th-century commentators who regarded him as a martyr for science. Some historians are of the opinion his heresy trial was not a response to his cosmological views but rather a response to his religious and [[afterlife]] views,{{sfn|Yates|1964|p=450}}<ref>Michael J. Crowe, ''The Extraterrestrial Life Debate 1750–1900'', Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 10, "[Bruno's] sources... seem to have been more numerous than his followers, at least until the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century revival of interest in Bruno as a supposed 'martyr for science.' It is true that he was burned at the stake in Rome in 1600, but the church authorities guilty of this action were almost certainly more distressed at his denial of Christ's divinity and alleged diabolism than at his cosmological doctrines."</ref><ref>[[Adam Frank]] (2009). ''The Constant Fire: Beyond the Science vs. Religion Debate'', University of California Press, p. 24, "Though Bruno may have been a brilliant thinker whose work stands as a bridge between ancient and modern thought, his persecution cannot be seen solely in light of the war between [[science and religion]]."</ref><ref>{{harvnb|White|2002|p=7}}: "This was perhaps the most dangerous notion of all...

His insistence on placing this issue at the center of both his work and of his defense is why Bruno remains so much a figure of the modern world. If there is, as many have argued, an intrinsic link between science and liberty of inquiry, then Bruno was among those who guaranteed the future of the newly emerging sciences, as well as claiming in wider terms a general principle of free thought and expression."</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Aquilecchia|Montano|Bertrando|2007}}: "In Rome, Bruno was imprisoned for seven years and subjected to a difficult trial that analyzed, minutely, all his philosophical ideas. Bruno, who in Venice had been willing to recant some theses, became increasingly resolute and declared on 21 December 1599 that he 'did not wish to repent of having too little to repent, and in fact did not know what to repent.' Declared an unrepentant heretic and excommunicated, he was burned alive in the Campo dei Fiori in Rome on Ash Wednesday, 17 February 1600. On the stake, along with Bruno, burned the hopes of many, including philosophers and scientists of good faith like Galileo, who thought they could reconcile religious faith and scientific research, while belonging to an ecclesiastical organization declaring itself to be the custodian of absolute truth and maintaining a cultural militancy requiring continual commitment and suspicion."</ref>

In addition to cosmology, Bruno also wrote extensively on the [[art of memory]], a loosely organized group of [[mnemonic]] techniques and principles. Historian [[Frances Yates]] argues that Bruno was deeply influenced by the presocratic [[Empedocles]], [[Neoplatonism]], Renaissance Hermeticism, and [[Book of Genesis]]-like legends surrounding the Hellenistic conception of [[Hermes Trismegistus]].<ref>The primary work on the relationship between Bruno and Hermeticism is {{harvnb|Yates|1964}}; for an alternative assessment, placing more emphasis on the Kabbalah, and less on Hermeticism, see {{harvnb|DeLeón-Jones|1997}}; for a return to emphasis on Bruno's role in the development of Science, and criticism of Yates' emphasis on magical and Hermetic themes, see {{harvnb|Gatti|2002}}.</ref> Other studies of Bruno have focused on his qualitative approach to mathematics and his application of the spatial concepts of geometry to language.<ref>Alessandro G.

==Life==
{{Hermeticism|expand=Historical figures}}

===Early years, 1548–1576===
Born Filippo <!-- please do not change to 'Giordano', which was the monastic name he took later --> Bruno in [[Nola]] (a ''[[comune]]'' in the modern-day [[province of Naples]], in the Southern Italian region of [[Campania]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]) in 1548, he was the son of Giovanni Bruno (1517 – c. 1592), a soldier, and Fraulissa Savolino (1520–?). In his youth he was sent to [[Naples]] to be educated. He was tutored privately at the Augustinian monastery there, and attended public lectures at the [[Studium Generale]].{{sfn|Singer|1968}} At the age of 17, he entered the [[Dominican Order]] at the monastery of [[San Domenico Maggiore]] in Naples, taking the name Giordano, after Giordano Crispo, his metaphysics tutor. He continued his studies there, completing his [[novitiate]], and [[Ordination|ordained]] a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priest]] in 1572 at age 24. During his time in Naples, he became known for his skill with the art of memory and on one occasion traveled to Rome to demonstrate his [[mnemonic]] system before [[Pope Pius V]] and [[Scipione Rebiba|Cardinal Rebiba]]. In his later years, Bruno claimed that the Pope accepted his dedication to him of the lost work ''On The Ark of Noah'' at this time.<ref>This is recorded in the diary of one Guillaume Cotin, librarian of the Abbey of St. Victor, who recorded recollections of a number of personal conversations he had with Bruno. Bruno also mentions this dedication in the Dedicatory Epistle of ''The Cabala of Pegasus'' (''Cabala del Cavallo Pegaseo'', 1585).</ref>

While Bruno was distinguished for outstanding ability, his taste for [[Freethought|free thinking]] and forbidden books soon caused him difficulties. Given the controversy he caused in later life, it is surprising that he was able to remain within the monastic system for eleven years. In his testimony to Venetian inquisitors during his trial many years later, he says that proceedings were twice taken against him for having cast away images of the saints, retaining only a [[crucifix]], and for having recommended controversial texts to a novice.{{sfn|Aquilecchia|Montano|Bertrando|2007|p=11}} Such behavior could perhaps be overlooked, but Bruno's situation became much more serious when he was reported to have defended the [[Arianism|Arian heresy]], and when a copy of the banned writings of [[Erasmus]], annotated by him, was discovered hidden in the monastery [[latrine]]. When he learned that an [[indictment]] was being prepared against him in Naples he fled, shedding his [[religious habit]], at least for a time.<ref>Gosselin has argued that Bruno's report that he returned to Dominican garb in Padua suggests that he kept his tonsure at least until his arrival in Geneva in 1579. He also suggests it is likely that Bruno kept the tonsure even after this point, showing a continued and deep religious attachment contrary to the way in which Bruno has been portrayed as a martyr for modern science. Instead, Gosselin argues, Bruno should be understood in the context of reformist Catholic dissenters. Edward A. Gosselin, "A Dominican Head in Layman's Garb? A Correction to the Scientific Iconography of Giordano Bruno", in ''[[The Sixteenth Century Journal]]'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Autumn, 1996), pp. 673–678.</ref>

===First years of wandering, 1576–1583===
Bruno first went to the Genoese port of [[Noli]], then to [[Savona]], [[Turin]] and finally to [[Venice]], where he published his lost work ''On the Signs of the Times'' with the permission (so he claimed at his trial) of the Dominican [[Remigio Nannini Fiorentino]]. From Venice he went to [[Padua]], where he met fellow Dominicans who convinced him to wear his [[religious habit]] again. From Padua he went to [[Bergamo]] and then across the Alps to [[Chambéry]] and [[Lyon]]. His movements after this time are obscure.<ref>{{harvnb|Singer|1968|p={{page needed|date=June 2024}}}}: "Following the northern route back through Brescia, Bruno came to Bergamo where he resumed the monastic habit. He perhaps visited Milan, and then leaving Italy he crossed the Alps by the Mont Cenis pass, and came to Chambéry. He describes his hospitable reception there by the Dominican Convent, but again he received no encouragement to remain, and he journeyed on to Lyons. Bruno's next movements are obscure. In 1579 he reached Geneva."</ref>

[[File:Earlierbruno.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The earliest depiction of Bruno is an engraving published in 1715 in Germany, presumed based on a lost contemporary portrait.<ref name="Salvestrini-1958">{{cite book |first=Virgilio |last=Salvestrini |title=Bibliografia di Giordano Bruno |publisher=Firenze |year=1958 |language=it}}</ref>]]

In 1579, Bruno arrived in [[Geneva]]. During his Venetian trial, he told inquisitors that while in Geneva he told the Marchese de Vico of Naples, who was notable for helping Italian refugees in Geneva, "I did not intend to adopt the religion of the city. I desired to stay there only that I might live at liberty and in security."{{sfn|Singer|1968|p=12}} Bruno had a pair of breeches made for himself, and the Marchese and others apparently made Bruno a gift of a sword, hat, cape and other necessities for dressing himself; in such clothing Bruno could no longer be recognized as a priest. Things apparently went well for Bruno for a time, as he entered his name in the Rector's Book of the [[University of Geneva]] in May 1579.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|p=42}} But in keeping with his personality he could not long remain silent. In August he published an attack on the work of {{interlanguage link|Antoine de La Faye|fr}}, a distinguished professor. Bruno and the printer, Jean Bergeon, were promptly arrested.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=44–45}} Rather than apologizing, Bruno insisted on continuing to defend his publication. He was refused the right to take [[sacrament]].{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=46–47}} Though this right was soon restored, he left Geneva.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|p=48–49}}

He went to France, arriving first in [[Lyon]], and thereafter settling for a time (1580–1581) in [[Toulouse]], where he took his doctorate in theology and was elected by students to lecture in philosophy.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=49–52}} He also attempted at this time to return to Catholicism, but was denied absolution by the Jesuit priest he approached.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|p=51}} When religious strife broke out in the summer of 1581, he moved to Paris.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|p=53}} There he held a cycle of thirty lectures on theological topics and also began to gain fame for his prodigious memory.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=56–57}} His talents attracted the benevolent attention of the king [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]; Bruno subsequently reported: <blockquote>"I got me such a name that King Henry III summoned me one day to discover from me if the memory which I possessed was natural or acquired by magic art. I satisfied him that it did not come from sorcery but from organized knowledge; and, following this, I got a book on memory printed, entitled ''The Shadows of Ideas'', which I dedicated to His Majesty. Forthwith he gave me an Extraordinary Lectureship with a salary."{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=57–58}}</blockquote>

In Paris, Bruno enjoyed the protection of his powerful French patrons. During this period, he published several works on mnemonics, including ''[[De umbris idearum]]'' (''On the Shadows of Ideas'', 1582), ''{{Ill|Ars memoriae (Giordano Bruno)|lt=Ars memoriae|it|Ars memoriae}}'' (''The Art of Memory'', 1582), and ''Cantus circaeus'' (''Circe's Song'', 1582; described at {{section link|Circe in the arts#Reasoning beasts}}). All of these were based on his mnemonic models of organized knowledge and experience, as opposed to the simplistic logic-based mnemonic techniques of [[Petrus Ramus]] then becoming popular.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Bruno also published a comedy summarizing some of his philosophical positions, titled ''Il Candelaio'' (''The Candlemaker'', 1582). In the 16th century dedications were, as a rule, approved beforehand, and hence were a way of placing a work under the protection of an individual. Given that Bruno dedicated various works to the likes of King Henry III, Sir [[Philip Sidney]], [[Michel de Castelnau]] (French Ambassador to England), and possibly [[Pope Pius V]], it is apparent that this wanderer had risen sharply in status and moved in powerful circles.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===England, 1583–1585===
[[File:GiordanoBrunomnemonic.gif|thumb|Woodcut illustration of one of Giordano Bruno's less complex mnemonic devices]]
In April 1583, Bruno went to England with letters of recommendation from [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] as a guest of the French ambassador, [[Michel de Castelnau]]. Bruno lived at the French embassy with the lexicographer [[John Florio]]. There he became acquainted with the poet [[Philip Sidney]] (to whom he dedicated two books) and other members of the Hermetic circle around [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]], though there is no evidence that Bruno ever met Dee himself. He also lectured at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], and unsuccessfully sought a teaching position there. His views were controversial, notably with [[John Underhill, Bishop of Oxford|John Underhill]], Rector of [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] and subsequently bishop of Oxford, and [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|George Abbot]], who later became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Abbot mocked Bruno for supporting "the opinion of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] that the earth did go round, and the heavens did stand still; whereas in truth it was his own head which rather did run round, and his brains did not stand still",<ref>{{cite journal |first=Andrew D. |last=Weiner |title=Expelling the Beast: Bruno's Adventures in England |journal=[[Modern Philology]] |volume=78 |issue=1 |year=1980 |pages=1–13 |jstor=437245 |doi=10.1086/391002|s2cid=161642786 }}</ref> and found Bruno had both plagiarized and misrepresented [[Marsilio Ficino|Ficino]]'s work, leading Bruno to return to the continent.<ref>Hannam, James. ''[[God's Philosophers: How the Medieval World Laid the Foundations of Modern Science]]''. [[Icon Books]] Ltd, 2009, 312, {{ISBN|978-1848310704}}</ref>

Nevertheless, his stay in England was fruitful. During that time Bruno completed and published some of his most important works, the six "Italian Dialogues", including the [[cosmological tract]]s ''La cena de le ceneri'' (''The Ash Wednesday Supper'', 1584), ''De la causa, principio et uno'' (''On Cause, Principle and Unity'', 1584), ''De l'infinito, universo et mondi'' (''On the Infinite, Universe and Worlds'', 1584) as well as ''Lo spaccio de la bestia trionfante'' (''The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast'', 1584) and ''{{ill|De gli eroici furori|it}}'' (''On the Heroic Frenzies'', 1585). Some of these were printed by [[John Charlewood]]. Some of the works that Bruno published in London, notably ''The Ash Wednesday Supper'', appear to have given offense. Once again, Bruno's controversial views and tactless language lost him the support of his friends. [[John Bossy]] has advanced the theory that, while staying in the French Embassy in London, Bruno was also spying on Catholic conspirators, under the pseudonym "Henry Fagot", for [[Sir Francis Walsingham]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s Secretary of State.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bossy |first=John | author-link = John Bossy |title=Giordano Bruno and the Embassy Affair |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |date=1991 |isbn=978-0-300-04993-0 }}</ref>

Bruno is sometimes cited as being the first to propose that the universe is infinite, which he did during his time in England, but an [[English people|English]] [[scientist]], [[Thomas Digges]], put forth this idea in a published work in 1576, some eight years earlier than Bruno.<ref>[[John Gribbin]] (2009). ''In Search of the Multiverse: Parallel Worlds, Hidden Dimensions, and the Ultimate Quest for the Frontiers of Reality'', {{ISBN|978-0470613528}}. p. 88</ref> An infinite universe and the possibility of alien life had also been earlier suggested by [[Germans|German]] [[Catholic Cardinal]] [[Nicholas of Cusa]] in "On Learned Ignorance" published in 1440 and Bruno attributed his understanding of multiple worlds to this earlier scholar, who he called "the divine Cusanus".<ref>{{cite book |last=Sgarbi|first=Marco |title=Encyclopedia of Renaissance Philosophy |location=New York |publisher=Springer International Publishing |date=2022 |isbn=978-3-319-141695}}. p. 255</ref>

===Last years of wandering, 1585–1592===
In October 1585, Castelnau was recalled to France, and Bruno went with him.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=112–113}} In Paris, Bruno found a tense political situation. Moreover, his 120 theses against [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] natural science soon put him in ill favor. In 1586, following a violent quarrel over these theses, he left France for Germany.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=189–194}}

[[File:Unnamed Figures.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut from "Articuli centum et sexaginta adversus huius tempestatis mathematicos atque philosophos", [[Prague]] 1588]]
In Germany he failed to obtain a teaching position at [[Marburg]], but was granted permission to teach at [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg]], where he lectured on [[Aristotle]] for two years.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=196–197}} However, with a change of intellectual climate there, he was no longer welcome, and went in 1588 to [[Prague]], where he obtained 300 [[Thaler|taler]] from [[Rudolf II]], but no teaching position.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=207–213}} He went on to serve briefly as a professor in [[University of Helmstedt|Helmstedt]], but had to flee again in 1590 when he was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]].{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=214–219}}

During this period he produced several [[Latin]] works, dictated to his friend and secretary Girolamo Besler, including ''De Magia'' (''On Magic''), ''Theses De Magia'' (''Theses on Magic'') and ''De Vinculis in Genere'' (''A General Account of Bonding''). All these were apparently transcribed or recorded by Besler (or Bisler) between 1589 and 1590.{{sfn|Bruno|1998|p=xxxvi}} He also published ''De Imaginum, Signorum, Et Idearum Compositione'' (''On the Composition of Images, Signs and Ideas'', 1591).

In 1591 he was in [[Frankfurt]], where he received an invitation from the [[Venice|Venetian]] patrician [[Mocenigo family|Giovanni Mocenigo]], who wished to be instructed in the art of memory,{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=224–225}} and also heard of a vacant chair in mathematics at the [[University of Padua]]. At the time the [[Inquisition]] seemed to be losing some of its strictness, and because the [[Republic of Venice]] was the most liberal state in the [[Italian Peninsula]], Bruno was lulled into making the fatal mistake of returning to Italy.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/82258/Giordano-Bruno/883/Final-years|title=Giordano Bruno|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=8 May 2014|quote=At the time such a move did not seem to be too much of a risk: Venice was by far the most liberal of the Italian states; the European tension had been temporarily eased after the death of the intransigent pope Sixtus V in 1590; the Protestant Henry of Bourbon was now on the throne of France, and a religious pacification seemed to be imminent.}}</ref>

He went first to [[Padua]], where he taught briefly, and applied unsuccessfully for the chair of mathematics, which was given instead to [[Galileo Galilei]] one year later. Bruno accepted Mocenigo's invitation and moved to Venice in March 1592.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|p=249}} For about two months he served as an in-house tutor to Mocenigo, to whom he let slip some of his heterodox ideas.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=253–257}} Mocenigo denounced him to the [[Venetian Holy Inquisition|Venetian Inquisition]], which had Bruno arrested on 22 May 1592.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=257–258}} Among the numerous charges of [[blasphemy]] and [[heresy]] brought against him in Venice, based on Mocenigo's denunciation, was his belief in the [[cosmic pluralism|plurality of worlds]], as well as accusations of personal misconduct.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|p=259}} Bruno defended himself skillfully, stressing the philosophical character of some of his positions, denying others and admitting that he had had doubts on some matters of dogma. The Roman Inquisition, however, asked for his transfer to Rome.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|pp=287–288}} After several months of argument, the Venetian authorities reluctantly consented and Bruno was sent to Rome in January 1593.{{sfn|Boulting|1914|p=292}}

===Imprisonment, trial and execution, 1593–1600===
During the seven years of his trial in Rome, Bruno was held in confinement, lastly in the [[Tower of Nona]]. Some important documents about the trial are lost, but others have been preserved, among them a summary of the proceedings that was rediscovered in 1940.<ref>"II Sommario del Processo di Giordano Bruno, con appendice di Documenti sull'eresia e l'inquisizione a Modena nel secolo XVI", edited by Angelo Mercati, in ''Studi e Testi'', vol. 101.</ref> The numerous charges against Bruno, based on some of his books as well as on witness accounts, included blasphemy, immoral conduct, and heresy in matters of dogmatic theology, and involved some of the basic doctrines of his philosophy and cosmology. [[Luigi Firpo]] speculates the charges made against Bruno by the Roman Inquisition were:{{sfn|Firpo|1993}}

* holding opinions contrary to the [[Catholicism|Catholic faith]] and speaking against it and its ministers;
* holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith about the [[Trinity]], the [[divinity of Christ]], and the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]];
* holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith pertaining to Jesus as the [[Christ (title)|Christ]];
* holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith regarding the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|virginity of Mary, mother of Jesus]];
* holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith about both [[Transubstantiation]] and the [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]];
* claiming the existence of a [[cosmic pluralism|plurality of worlds]] and [[Eternity of the world|their eternity]];
* believing in [[metempsychosis]] and in the [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] of the human soul into brutes;
* dealing in magics and divination.

[[File:Relief Bruno Campo dei Fiori n1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The trial of Giordano Bruno by the Roman Inquisition; bronze relief by Ettore Ferrari, [[Campo de' Fiori]], Rome]]
Bruno defended himself as he had in Venice, insisting that he accepted the Church's dogmatic teachings, but trying to preserve the basis of his cosmological views. In particular, he held firm to his belief in the plurality of worlds, although he was admonished to abandon it. His trial was overseen by the Inquisitor Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine|Bellarmine]], who demanded a full recantation, which Bruno eventually refused. On 20 January 1600, [[Pope Clement VIII]] declared Bruno a heretic, and the Inquisition issued a sentence of death. According to the correspondence of [[Caspar Schoppe|Gaspar Schopp]] of [[Breslau]], he is said to have made a threatening gesture towards his judges and to have replied: ''Maiori forsan cum timore sententiam in me fertis quam ego accipiam'' ("Perhaps you pronounce this sentence against me with greater fear than I receive it").<ref>{{harvnb|Singer|1968|loc=ch. 7}}: "A gloating account of the whole ritual is given in a letter written on the very day by a youth named Gaspar Schopp of Breslau, a recent convert to Catholicism to whom Pope Clement VIII had shown great favor, creating him Knight of St. Peter and Count of the Sacred Palace. Schopp was addressing Conrad Rittershausen. He recounts that because of his heresy Bruno had been publicly burned that day in the Square of Flowers in front of the Theatre of Pompey. He makes merry over the belief of the Italians that every heretic is a Lutheran. It is evident that he had been present at the interrogations, for he relates in detail the life of Bruno and the works and doctrines for which he had been arraigned, and he gives a vivid account of Bruno's final appearance before his judges on 8 February. To Schopp we owe the knowledge of Bruno's bearing under judgement. When the verdict had been declared, records Schopp, Bruno with a threatening gesture addressed his judges: "Perchance you who pronounce my sentence are in greater fear than I who receive it." Thus he was dismissed to the prison, gloats the convert, "and was given eight days to recant, but in vain. So today he was led to the funeral pyre. When the image of our Savior was shown to him before his death he angrily rejected it with averted face. Thus my dear Rittershausen is it our custom to proceed against such men or rather indeed such monsters."</ref>

He was turned over to the secular authorities. On 17 February 1600, in the [[Campo de' Fiori]] (a central Roman market square), naked, with his "tongue imprisoned because of his wicked words", he was [[Death by burning|burned alive at the stake]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first=Timothy|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b67p1VdF_OoC&pg=PA239|access-date=11 May 2017|date= 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-804103-0|page=239}}</ref><ref>"Il Sommario del Processo di Giordano Bruno, con appendice di Documenti sull'eresia e l'inquisizione a Modena nel secolo XVI", edited by Angelo Mercati, in ''Studi e Testi'', vol. 101; the precise terminology for the tool used to silence Bruno before burning is recorded as ''una morsa di legno'', or "a vise of wood", and not an iron spike as sometimes claimed by other sources.</ref> His ashes were thrown into the [[Tiber]] river.

All of Bruno's works were placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' in 1603. The inquisition cardinals who judged Giordano Bruno were [[Robert Bellarmine|Cardinal Bellarmino (Bellarmine)]], [[Carlo Gaudenzio Madruzzo|Cardinal Madruzzo (Madruzzi)]], Camillo Cardinal Borghese (later [[Pope Paul V]]), Domenico Cardinal Pinelli, Pompeio Cardinal Arrigoni, [[Paolo Emilio Sfondrati|Cardinal Sfondrati]], [[Pedro de Deza|Pedro Cardinal De Deza Manuel]] and [[Giulio Antonio Santorio|Cardinal Santorio]] (Archbishop of Santa Severina, Cardinal-Bishop of Palestrina).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valentinuzzi|first=Max E.|date=4 October 2019|title=Giordano Bruno: Expander of the Copernican Universe|journal=IEEE Pulse|volume=10|issue=5|pages=23–27|doi=10.1109/MPULS.2019.2937244|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The measures taken to prevent Bruno continuing to speak have resulted in his becoming a symbol for free thought and [[free speech]] in present-day Rome, where an annual memorial service takes place close to the spot where he was executed.{{sfn|Rowland|2016|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=C-q8CwAAQBAJ&pg=PT8 8]}}

===Physical appearance===
The earliest likeness of Bruno is an engraving published in 1715<ref>Edward A. Gosselin, "A Dominican Head in Layman's Garb? A Correction to the Scientific Iconography of Giordano Bruno", in ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Autumn, 1996), p. 674</ref> and cited by Salvestrini as "the only known portrait of Bruno". Salvestrini suggests that it is a re-engraving made from a now lost original.<ref name="Salvestrini-1958"/> This engraving has provided the source for later images.

The records of Bruno's imprisonment by the Venetian inquisition in May 1592 describe him as a man "of average height, with a hazel-coloured beard and the appearance of being about forty years of age". Alternately, a passage in a work by [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|George Abbot]] indicates that Bruno was of diminutive stature: "When that Italian Didapper, who intituled himselfe Philotheus Iordanus Brunus Nolanus, magis elaboratae Theologiae Doctor, &c. with a name longer than his body...".<ref>Robert McNulty, "Bruno at Oxford", in Renaissance News, 1960 (XIII), pp. 300–305</ref>

In the second half of the 16th century, the theories of Copernicus (1473–1543) began diffusing through Europe. Copernicus conserved the idea of planets fixed to solid spheres, but considered the apparent motion of the stars to be an illusion caused by the rotation of the Earth on its axis; he also preserved the notion of an immobile center, but it was the Sun rather than the Earth. Copernicus also argued the Earth was a planet orbiting the Sun once every year. However he maintained the [[Ptolemaic model|Ptolemaic hypothesis]] that the orbits of the planets were composed of perfect circles—[[deferents]] and [[epicycles]]—and that the stars were fixed on a stationary outer sphere.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koyré|first=Alexandre|date=1943|title=NICOLAS COPERNICUS|journal=Bulletin of the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in America|volume=1|pages=705–730}}</ref>

Despite the widespread publication of Copernicus' work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', during Bruno's time most educated Catholics subscribed to the Aristotelian [[geocentrism|geocentric]] view that the Earth was the [[History of the Center of the Universe|center of the universe]], and that all heavenly bodies revolved around it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blackwell|first=Richard|title=Galileo, Bellarmine, and the Bible|date=1991|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame|isbn=978-0268010249|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MHnwAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> The ultimate limit of the universe was the ''primum mobile'', whose diurnal rotation was conferred upon it by a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] God, not part of the universe (although, as the [[Empyrean (disambiguation)|kingdom of heaven]], [[Celestial spheres|adjacent to it]]<ref>See e.g. [[Celestial spheres#mediaviewer/File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|Cosmography by Peter Apian, Antwerp 1539]] and its outer sphere</ref>), a motionless [[Cosmological argument|prime mover]] and [[first cause]]. The fixed stars were part of this celestial sphere, all at the same fixed distance from the immobile Earth at the center of the sphere. [[Ptolemy]] had numbered these at 1,022, grouped into 48 [[constellation]]s. The [[planet]]s were each fixed to a transparent sphere.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=Henry Norris|date=1931|title=Tidying Up the Constellations|journal=Scientific American|volume=144|issue=6|pages=380–381|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0631-380|issn=0036-8733|bibcode=1931SciAm.144..380R}}</ref>

Few [[astronomer]]s of Bruno's time accepted [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernicus's heliocentric model]]. Among those who did were the Germans [[Michael Maestlin]] (1550–1631), [[Christoph Rothmann]], [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630); the Englishman [[Thomas Digges]] (c. 1546–1595), author of ''A Perfit Description of the Caelestial Orbes''; and the Italian [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642).

===Cosmological claims===
{{main|Heliocentrism}}
In 1584, Bruno published two important philosophical dialogues (''La Cena de le Ceneri'' and ''De l'infinito universo et mondi'') in which he argued against the planetary spheres ([[Christoph Rothmann]] did the same in 1586 as did [[Tycho Brahe]] in 1587) and affirmed the Copernican principle.

In particular, to support the Copernican view and oppose the objection according to which the motion of the Earth would be perceived by means of the motion of winds, clouds etc., in ''La Cena de le Ceneri'' Bruno anticipates some of the arguments of Galilei on the relativity principle.<ref>{{Citation|last = [[Alessandro De Angelis (astrophysicist)|Alessandro De Angelis]] and Catarina Espirito Santo|year = 2015|title = The contribution of Giordano Bruno to the principle of relativity|url = http://www.narit.or.th/en/files/2015JAHHvol18/2015JAHH...18..241D.pdf|journal = Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage|volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 241–248| doi=10.3724/SP.J.1440-2807.2015.03.02 |arxiv = 1504.01604|bibcode = 2015JAHH...18..241D| s2cid=118420438 |access-date = 19 January 2016|archive-date = 26 January 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160126194011/http://www.narit.or.th/en/files/2015JAHHvol18/2015JAHH...18..241D.pdf|url-status = dead}}</ref> Note that he also uses the example now known as [[Galileo's ship]].

<blockquote>Theophilus  – [...] air through which the clouds and winds move are parts of the Earth, [...] to mean under the name of Earth the whole machinery and the entire animated part, which consists of dissimilar parts; so that the rivers, the rocks, the seas, the whole vaporous and turbulent air, which is enclosed within the highest mountains, should belong to the Earth as its members, just as the air [does] in the lungs and in other cavities of animals by which they breathe, widen their arteries, and other similar effects necessary for life are performed. The clouds, too, move through accidents in the body of the Earth and are in its bowels as are the waters. [...] With the Earth move [...] all things that are on the Earth. If, therefore, from a point outside the Earth something were thrown upon the Earth, it would lose, because of the latter's motion, its straightness as would be seen on the ship [...] moving along a river, if someone on point C of the riverbank were to throw a stone along a straight line, and would see the stone miss its target by the amount of the velocity of the ship's motion.  But if someone were placed high on the mast of that ship, move as it may however fast, he would not miss his target at all, so that the stone or some other heavy thing thrown downward would not come along a straight line from the point E which is at the top of the mast, or cage, to the point D which is at the bottom of the mast, or at some point in the bowels and body of the ship. Thus, if from the point D to the point E someone who is inside the ship would throw a stone straight up, it would return to the bottom along the same line however far the ship moved, provided it was not subject to any pitch and roll."<ref>Giordano Bruno, Teofilo, in La Cena de le Ceneri, "Third Dialogue", (1584), ed. and trans. by S.L. Jaki (1975).</ref></blockquote>

Bruno's infinite universe was filled with a substance—a "pure air", [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], or ''spiritus''—that offered no resistance to the heavenly bodies which, in Bruno's view, rather than being fixed, moved under their own [[Impetus (mechanics)|impetus]] (momentum). Most dramatically, he completely abandoned the idea of a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] universe.

<blockquote>The universe is then one, infinite, immobile... It is not capable of comprehension and therefore is endless and limitless, and to that extent infinite and indeterminable, and consequently immobile.<ref>Giordano Bruno, Teofilo, in Cause, Principle, and Unity, "Fifth Dialogue", (1588), ed. and trans. by Jack Lindsay (1962).</ref></blockquote>

Bruno's cosmology distinguishes between "suns" which produce their own light and heat, and have other bodies moving around them; and "earths" which move around suns and receive light and heat from them.<ref name="Bruno-1584">{{cite book

During the late 16th century, and throughout the 17th century, Bruno's ideas were held up for ridicule, debate, or inspiration. [[Margaret Cavendish]], for example, wrote an entire series of poems against "atoms" and "infinite worlds" in ''Poems and Fancies'' in 1664. Bruno's true, if partial, vindication would have to wait for the implications and impact of [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] cosmology.

Bruno's overall contribution to the birth of modern science is still controversial. Some scholars follow Frances Yates in stressing the importance of Bruno's ideas about the universe being infinite and lacking geocentric structure as a crucial crossing point between the old and the new. Others see in Bruno's idea of multiple worlds instantiating the infinite possibilities of a pristine, indivisible One,<ref>{{cite book

Und so zeigt sich auch der Begriff Gottes von dem des Universums nicht getrennt; Gott ist naturierende Natur, Weltseele, Weltkraft. Da Bruno durchaus ablehnt, gegen die Religion zu lehren, so hat man solche Angaben wohl umgekehrt zu verstehen: Weltkraft, Weltseele, naturierende Natur, Universum sind in Gott. Gott ist Kraft der Weltkraft, Seele der Weltseele, Natur der Natur, Eins des Universums. Bruno spricht ja auch von mehreren Teilen der universellen Vernunft, des Urvermögens und der Urwirklichkeit. Und damit hängt zusammen, daß für ihn die Welt unendlich ist und ohne Anfang und Ende; sie ist in demselben Sinne allumfassend wie Gott. Aber nicht ganz wie Gott. Gott sei in allem und im einzelnen allumfassend, die Welt jedoch wohl in allem, aber nicht im einzelnen, da sie ja Teile in sich zuläßt."</ref> However, [[Otto Kern]] takes exception to what he considers Weinstein's overbroad assertions that Bruno, as well as other historical philosophers such as [[John Scotus Eriugena]], [[Nicholas of Cusa]], [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], were pandeists or leaned towards pandeism.<ref>Review of ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Perception of Nature") in [[Emil Schürer]], [[Adolf von Harnack]], editors, ''Theologische Literaturzeitung'' ("Theological Literature Journal"), Volume 35, column 827 (1910): "Dem Verfasser hat anscheinend die Einteilung: religiöse, rationale und naturwissenschaftlich fundierte Weltanschauungen vorgeschwebt; er hat sie dann aber seinem Material gegenüber schwer durchführbar gefunden und durch die mitgeteilte ersetzt, die das Prinzip der Einteilung nur noch dunkel durchschimmern läßt. Damit hängt wohl auch das vom Verfasser gebildete unschöne griechisch-lateinische Mischwort des 'Pandeismus' zusammen. Nach S. 228 versteht er darunter im Unterschied von dem mehr metaphysisch gearteten Pantheismus einen 'gesteigerten und vereinheitlichten Animismus', also eine populäre Art religiöser Weltdeutung. Prhagt man lieh dies ein, so erstaunt man über die weite Ausdehnung, die dem Begriff in der Folge gegeben wird. Nach S. 284 ist Scotus Erigena ein ganzer, nach S. 300 Anselm von Canterbury ein 'halber Pandeist'; aber auch bei Nikolaus Cusanus und Giordano Bruno, ja selbst bei Mendelssohn und Lessing wird eine Art von Pandeismus gefunden (S. 306. 321. 346.)." ''Translation'': "The author apparently intended to divide up religious, rational and scientifically based philosophies, but found his material overwhelming, resulting in an effort that can shine through the principle of classification only darkly. This probably is also the source of the unsightly Greek-Latin compound word, 'Pandeism.' At page 228, he understands the difference from the more metaphysical kind of pantheism, an enhanced unified animism that is a popular religious worldview. In remembering this borrowing, we were struck by the vast expanse given the term. According to page 284, Scotus Erigena is one entirely, at p. 300 Anselm of Canterbury is 'half Pandeist'; but also Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno, and even in Mendelssohn and Lessing a kind of Pandeism is found (p. 306 321 346.)".</ref> ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' editor [[Corey S.

===Late Vatican position===
The Vatican has published few official statements about Bruno's trial and execution. In 1942, Cardinal [[Giovanni Mercati]], who discovered a number of lost documents relating to Bruno's trial, stated that the Church was perfectly justified in condemning him.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}} On the 400th anniversary of Bruno's death, in 2000, Cardinal [[Angelo Sodano]] declared Bruno's death to be a "sad episode" but, despite his regret, he defended Bruno's prosecutors, maintaining that the Inquisitors "had the desire to serve freedom and promote the common good and did everything possible to save his life".<ref>{{cite news|last=Seife |first=Charles |title=Vatican Regrets Burning Cosmologist |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2000/03/01-04.html |access-date=24 June 2012 |newspaper=Science Now |date=1 March 2000 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608054739/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2000/03/01-04.html |archive-date=8 June 2013  }}</ref> In the same year, Pope [[John Paul II]] made a general apology for "the use of violence that some have committed in the service of truth".<ref>{{citation |author= Robinson, B A|date=7 March 2000|title=Apologies by Pope John Paul II|publisher=Ontario Consultants.

===A martyr of science===
{{See also|Conflict thesis}}
Some authors have characterized Bruno as a "martyr of science", suggesting parallels with the [[Galileo affair]] which began around 1610.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/popularsciencemo0712newy#page/110/mode/2up ''"Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei,"''] The Popular Science Monthly, Supplement, 1878.</ref> "It should not be supposed," writes A. M. Paterson of Bruno and his "heliocentric solar system", that he "reached his conclusions via some mystical revelation&nbsp;... His work is an essential part of the scientific and philosophical developments that he initiated."<ref>Antoinette Mann Paterson (1970). ''The Infinite Worlds of Giordano Bruno''. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, Illinois, 1970, p.&nbsp;16.</ref> Paterson echoes [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] in writing that Bruno "ushers in a modern theory of knowledge that understands all natural things in the universe to be known by the human mind through the mind's dialectical structure".<ref>Paterson, p.&nbsp;61.</ref>

Ingegno writes that Bruno embraced the philosophy of [[Lucretius]], "aimed at liberating man from the fear of death and the gods."{{sfn|Bruno|1998|loc="Introduction"}} Characters in Bruno's ''Cause, Principle and Unity'' desire "to improve speculative science and knowledge of natural things," and to achieve a philosophy "which brings about the perfection of the human intellect most easily and eminently, and most closely corresponds to the truth of nature."{{sfn|Bruno|1998|p=63}}

Other scholars oppose such views, and claim Bruno's martyrdom to science to be exaggerated, or outright false. For Yates, while "nineteenth century liberals" were thrown "into ecstasies" over Bruno's Copernicanism, "Bruno pushes Copernicus' scientific work back into a prescientific stage, back into Hermeticism, interpreting the Copernican diagram as a hieroglyph of divine mysteries."{{sfn|Yates|1964|p=225}}

According to historian Mordechai Feingold, "Both admirers and critics of Giordano Bruno basically agree that he was pompous and arrogant, highly valuing his opinions and showing little patience with anyone who even mildly disagreed with him." Discussing Bruno's experience of rejection when he visited Oxford University, Feingold suggests that "it might have been Bruno's manner, his language and his self-assertiveness, rather than his ideas" that caused offence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Feingold|first1=Mordechai|title=Occult and scientific mentalities in the Renaissance|last2=Vickers|first2=Brian|year=1984|pages=73–94|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511572999.004|isbn=978-0511572999}}</ref>

===Theological heresy===
In his ''[[Lectures on the History of Philosophy]]'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] writes that Bruno's life represented "a bold rejection of all [[Catholic]] beliefs resting on mere authority."<ref>Hegel's lectures on the history of philosophy, translated by E. S. Haldane and F. H. Simson, in three volumes. Volume III, p. 119. The Humanities Press, 1974, New York.</ref>

Alfonso Ingegno states that Bruno's philosophy "challenges the developments of the Reformation, calls into question the truth-value of the whole of Christianity, and claims that Christ perpetrated a deceit on mankind&nbsp;... Bruno suggests that we can now recognize the universal law which controls the perpetual becoming of all things in an infinite universe."{{sfn|Bruno|1998|p=x}} A. M. Paterson says that, while we no longer have a copy of the official papal condemnation of Bruno, his heresies included "the doctrine of the infinite universe and the innumerable worlds" and his beliefs "on the movement of the earth".<ref>Paterson, p.&nbsp;198.</ref>

Michael White notes that the Inquisition may have pursued Bruno early in his life on the basis of his opposition to [[Aristotle]], interest in [[Arianism]], reading of [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]], and possession of banned texts.{{sfn|White|2002|p=7}} White considers that Bruno's later heresy was "multifaceted" and may have rested on his conception of infinite worlds. "This was perhaps the most dangerous notion of all&nbsp;... If other worlds existed with intelligent beings living there, did they too have their visitations? The idea was quite unthinkable."{{sfn|White|2002|p=7}}

[[Frances Yates]] rejects what she describes as the "legend that Bruno was prosecuted as a philosophical thinker, was burned for his daring views on innumerable worlds or on the movement of the earth." Yates however writes that "the Church was&nbsp;... perfectly within its rights if it included philosophical points in its condemnation of Bruno's heresies" because "the philosophical points were quite inseparable from the heresies."{{sfn|Yates|1964|pp=354–356}}

According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "in 1600 there was no official Catholic position on the Copernican system, and it was certainly not a heresy. When [...] Bruno [...] was burned at the stake as a heretic, it had nothing to do with his writings in support of Copernican cosmology."<ref>Sheila Rabin, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus/ "Nicolaus Copernicus"] in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (online. Retrieved 19 November 2005).</ref>

The website of the [[Vatican Apostolic Archive]], discussing a summary of legal proceedings against Bruno in Rome, states:

<blockquote>In the same rooms where Giordano Bruno was questioned, for the same important reasons of the relationship between science and faith, at the dawning of the new astronomy and at the decline of Aristotle's philosophy, sixteen years later, [[Robert Bellarmine|Cardinal Bellarmino]], who then contested Bruno's heretical theses, summoned Galileo Galilei, who also faced a famous inquisitorial trial, which, luckily for him, ended with a simple abjuration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asv.vatican.va/en/doc/1597.htm|title=Summary of the trial against Giordano Bruno: Rome, 1597|publisher=Vatican Secret Archives|access-date=18 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609095413/http://asv.vatican.va/en/doc/1597.htm|archive-date=9 June 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

===In art===

Following the 1870 [[Capture of Rome]] by the newly created [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the end of the Church's [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]] over the city, the erection of a [[Statue of Giordano Bruno|monument to Bruno]] on the site of his execution became feasible. The monument was sharply opposed by the clerical party, but was finally erected by the Rome Municipality and inaugurated in 1889.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080929/findlen|title=A hungry mind: Giordano Bruno, philosopher and heretic|last=Findlen|first=Paula|publisher=[[The Nation]]|date=10 September 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204092400/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080929/findlen|archive-date=4 December 2008|quote="Campo de' Fiori was festooned with flags bearing Masonic symbols.

Retrospective iconography of Bruno shows him with a Dominican [[cowl]] but not [[tonsure]]d. Edward Gosselin has suggested that it is likely Bruno kept his tonsure at least until 1579, and it is possible that he wore it again thereafter.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gosselin|first=Edward A.|year=1996|title=A Dominican Head in Layman's Garb?

An idealized animated version of Bruno appears in the first episode of the 2014 television series ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]''. In this depiction, Bruno is shown with a more modern look, without tonsure and wearing clerical robes and without his hood. ''Cosmos'' presents Bruno as an impoverished philosopher who was ultimately executed due to his refusal to recant his belief in other worlds, a portrayal that was criticized by some as simplistic or historically inaccurate.<ref name="Powell-2014">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/03/10/cosmos-pick-wrong-hero/ |title=Did ''Cosmos'' Pick the Wrong Hero? |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]] |date=10 March 2014 |access-date=16 March 2014 |last=Powell |first=Corey S. |archive-date=16 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316084525/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/03/10/cosmos-pick-wrong-hero/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenau|first=Josh|title=Why Did Cosmos Focus on Giordano Bruno?|url=http://ncse.com/blog/2014/03/why-did-cosmos-focus-giordano-bruno-0015457|publisher=National Center for Science Education|access-date=14 April 2014|date=18 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sessions|first=David|title=How 'Cosmos' Bungles the History of Religion and Science|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/23/how-cosmos-bungles-the-history-of-religion-and-science.html|access-date=8 May 2014|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=3 March 2014}}</ref> Corey S.

===In fiction===
Bruno and his theory of "the coincidence of contraries" (''coincidentia oppositorum'') play an important role in [[James Joyce]]'s 1939 novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. Joyce wrote in a letter to his patroness, [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]], "His philosophy is a kind of dualism – every power in nature must evolve an opposite in order to realise itself and opposition brings reunion".<ref>James Joyce, Letter to Harriet Shaw Weaver, 27 January 1925, ''Selected Letters'', p. 307</ref> Amongst his numerous allusions to Bruno in his novel, including his trial and torture, Joyce plays upon Bruno's notion of ''coincidentia oppositorum'' through applying his name to word puns such as "Browne and Nolan" (the name of Dublin printers) and '"brownesberrow in nolandsland".<ref>McHugh, Roland. Annotations to Finnegans Wake. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1980. Print, xv.</ref>
