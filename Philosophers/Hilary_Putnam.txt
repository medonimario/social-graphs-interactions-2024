'''Hilary Whitehall Putnam''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʌ|t|n|əm}}; July 31, 1926 – March 13, 2016) was an American philosopher, mathematician, computer scientist, and figure in [[analytic philosophy]] in the second half of the 20th century.

In 1976, Putnam was elected president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. The next year, he was selected as Walter Beverly Pearson Professor of Mathematical Logic in recognition of his contributions to the [[philosophy of logic]] and mathematics. While breaking with his radical past, Putnam never abandoned his belief that academics have a particular social and ethical responsibility toward society. He continued to be forthright and progressive in his political views, as expressed in the articles "How Not to Solve Ethical Problems" (1983) and "Education for Democracy" (1993).<ref name="Hick"/>

== Philosophy of mind ==

=== Multiple realizability ===
[[File:Reduktionismus.png|thumb|right|An illustration of multiple realizability. ''M'' stands for mental and ''P'' stands for physical. It can be seen that more than one ''P'' can instantiate one ''M'', but not vice versa. Causal relations between states are represented by the arrows (''M1'' goes to ''M2'', etc.).]]

Putnam's best-known work concerns philosophy of mind. His most noted original contributions to that field came in several key papers published in the late 1960s that set out the hypothesis of [[multiple realizability]].<ref name="Bick">{{cite SEP|author-last=Bickle |author-first=John |url-id=multiple-realizability |title=Multiple Realizability |date=Fall 2006}}</ref> In these papers, Putnam argues that, contrary to the famous claim of the [[type-identity theory]], pain may correspond to utterly different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms even if they all experience the same mental state of "being in pain".<ref name="Bick"/> Putnam cited examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. He asked whether it was likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain, or other mental states, the same way. If they do not share the same brain structures, they cannot share the same [[animal cognition|mental states]] and properties, in which case mental states must be realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then took his argument a step further, asking about such things as the nervous systems of alien beings, artificially [[artificial intelligence|intelligent robots]] and other [[silicon-based life form]]s. These hypothetical entities, he contended, should not be considered incapable of experiencing pain just because they lack human [[neurochemistry]]. Putnam concluded that type-identity theorists had been making an "ambitious" and "highly implausible" conjecture that could be disproved by one example of multiple realizability. This is sometimes called the "likelihood argument", as it focuses on the claim that multiple realizability is more likely than type-identity theory.<ref name="MLR">{{cite book|last=Putnam |first=H. |title=Mind, Language and Reality. Philosophical Papers, vol. 2 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1975 |isbn=88-459-0257-9}}</ref><ref name=":3" />{{Rp|page=640}}

Putnam also formulated an ''[[a priori]]'' argument in favor of multiple realizability based on what he called "functional isomorphism". He defined the concept in these terms: "Two systems are functionally isomorphic if 'there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations'." In the case of computers, two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if the sequential relations among states in the first exactly mirror the sequential relations among states in the other. Therefore, a computer made of silicon chips and one made of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse. Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability.<ref name="MLR"/><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Lawrence A. |author-link=Lawrence Shapiro|date=2000 |title=Multiple Realizations |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2678460 |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=97 |issue=12 |pages=635–654 |doi=10.2307/2678460 |jstor=2678460 |issn=0022-362X}}</ref>{{Rp|page=637}}

Putnam, [[Jerry Fodor]], and others argued that along with being an effective argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general. [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]], which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects, abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore seemed to be a better explanation of the relation between mind and body.

=== Machine state functionalism ===
Putnam himself put forth the first formulation of such a functionalist theory. This formulation, now called "machine-state functionalism", was inspired by analogies Putnam and others made between the mind and [[Turing machine]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis |first=J. B. |title=The Theory of the Individual in Economics: Identity and Value |location=Oxford|publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpZKxHzGlC4C&pg=PA87 |page=87 |isbn=978-0-415-20219-0 |oclc=779084377}}</ref> The point for functionalism is the nature of the states of the Turing machine. Each state can be defined in terms of its relations to the other states and to the inputs and outputs, and the details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant. According to machine-state functionalism, the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of a Turing machine state. Just as "state one" simply is the state in which, given a particular input, such-and-such happens, so being in pain is the state which disposes one to cry "ouch", become distracted, wonder what the cause is, and so forth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Block |first=Ned |chapter=What is Functionalism | chapter-url=https://www.nedblock.us/papers/functionalism.encyc.pdf|title=Consciousness, Function, and Representation |publisher=MIT Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-262-02603-1 |oclc=494256364 |pages=27–44}}</ref>

=== Rejection of functionalism ===
[[Ian Hacking]] called ''Representation and Reality'' (1988) a book that "will mostly be read as Putnam’s denunciation of his former philosophical psychology, to which he gave the name 'functionalism'."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hacking |first=Ian |author-link=Ian Hacking |date=1989-05-04 |title=Putnam's Change of Mind |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v11/n09/ian-hacking/putnam-s-change-of-mind |access-date=2024-06-05 |work=[[London Review of Books]] |language=en |volume=11 |issue=9 |issn=0260-9592}}</ref> Writing in ''[[Noûs]]'', Barbara Hannon described "the inventor of functionalism" as arguing "against his own former computationalist views".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hannon |first=Barbara |date=1993 |title=Review of Representation and Reality. |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2215905 |journal=Noûs |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=102–106 |doi=10.2307/2215905 |jstor=2215905 |issn=0029-4624}}</ref>

Putnam's change of mind was primarily due to the difficulties computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions with respect to the [[Internalism and externalism|externalism]] of mental content.<ref name="Three">{{cite book |last=Putnam |first=H. |title=The Threefold Cord: Mind, Body, and World |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-231-10286-5 |location=New York |oclc=868429895}}</ref> This is illustrated by his [[Twin Earth thought experiment]].{{Primary source inline|date=October 2022}}

In 1988 Putnam also developed a separate argument against functionalism based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down [[identity theory of mind|identity theory]] in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, he argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism is that the same mental state could be implemented by the different states of a [[universal Turing machine]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Putnam |first=Hilary |year=1988 |title=Representation and Reality |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-66074-7 |oclc=951364040}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=October 2022}}

Despite Putnam's rejection of functionalism, it has continued to flourish and been developed into numerous versions by Fodor, [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], [[Daniel Dennett]], and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], among others.<ref name="Mar">{{cite book|last=Marhaba |first=S. |year=2004 |chapter=Funzionalismo |title=Enciclopedia Garzanti della Filosofia |editor-link1=Gianni Vattimo |editor-first1=G. |editor-last1=Vattimo |editor-first2=G. |editor-last2=Chiurazzi |location=Milan |publisher=[[Aldo Garzanti|Garzanti Editore]] |isbn=88-11-50515-1}}</ref> Functionalism helped lay the foundations for modern [[cognitive science]]<ref name="Mar"/> and is the dominant theory of mind in philosophy today.<ref>{{cite SEP|last=Levin |first=Janet |url-id=functionalism |title=Functionalism |date=Fall 2004}}</ref>

By 2012 Putnam accepted a modification of functionalism called "liberal functionalism". The view holds that "what matters for consciousness and for mental properties generally is the right sort of functional capacities and not the particular matter that subserves those capacities".<ref name="blog">{{cite web |last=Putnam |first=Hilary |date=October 30, 2015 |title=What Wiki Doesn't Know About Me |url=https://putnamphil.blogspot.com/2014/10/what-wiki-doesnt-know-about-me-in-1976.html |access-date=March 15, 2016 |work=Sardonic comment}}</ref> The specification of these capacities may refer to what goes on outside the organism's "brain", may include intentional idioms, and need not describe a capacity to compute something or other.<ref name="blog"/>

Putnam himself formulated one of the main arguments against functionalism, the [[Twin Earth thought experiment]], though there have been additional criticisms. [[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room]] argument (1980) is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions. It is designed to show that it is possible to mimic intelligent action with a purely functional system, without any interpretation or understanding. Searle describes a situation in which a person who speaks only English is locked in a room with Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around. People outside the room instruct the person inside to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols. The people outside the room speak Chinese and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols. According to Searle, it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside "knows" Chinese based on these syntactic processes alone. This argument attempts to show that systems that operate merely on syntactic processes cannot realize any [[semantics]] (meaning) or [[intentionality]] (aboutness). Searle thus attacks the idea that thought can be equated with following a set of syntactic rules and concludes that functionalism is an inadequate theory of the mind.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Searle |first=John |year=1980 |title=Minds, Brains and Programs |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=3 |pages=417–424 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00005756 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221025515/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.searle2.html |archive-date=February 21, 2001 |number=3 |s2cid=55303721}}</ref> [[Ned Block]] has advanced several other arguments against functionalism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Block |first=Ned |title=Perception and Cognition: Issues in the Foundations of Psychology, Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-816-60841-6 |editor-last=Savage |editor-first=C.

== Philosophy of language ==
=== Semantic externalism ===
One of Putnam's contributions to [[philosophy of language]] is his [[semantic externalism]], the claim that terms' meanings are determined by factors outside the mind, encapsulated in his slogan that "meaning just ain't in the head". His views on meaning, first laid out in ''Meaning and Reference'' (1973), then in'' The Meaning of "Meaning"'' (1975), use his "Twin Earth" thought experiment to defend this thesis.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Aranyosi |first=István |title=The Peripheral Mind: Philosophy of Mind and the Peripheral Nervous System |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-998960-7 |pages=77–101 |chapter=Semantic Externalism |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199989607.003.0005}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Externalism About the Mind |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, [[Stanford University]] |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entries/content-externalism/ |last1=Rowlands |first1=Mark |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=E. N. |edition=Winter 2020 |last2=Lau |first2=Joe |last3=Deutsch |first3=Max|date=December 10, 2020 }}</ref>

Twin Earth shows this, according to Putnam, since on Twin Earth everything is identical to Earth, except that its lakes, rivers and oceans are filled with XYZ rather than H<sub>2</sub>O. Consequently, when an earthling, Fredrick, uses the Earth-English word "water", it has a different meaning from the Twin Earth-English word "water" when used by his physically identical twin, Frodrick, on Twin Earth. Since Fredrick and Frodrick are physically indistinguishable when they utter their respective words, and since their words have different meanings, meaning cannot be determined solely by what is in their heads.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Stalnaker |first=Robert |date=1993 |title=Twin Earth Revisited |jstor=4545179 |journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society |volume=93 |pages=297–311 |doi=10.1093/aristotelian/93.1.297 |issn=0066-7374}}</ref> This led Putnam to adopt a version of [[semantic externalism]] with regard to meaning and mental content.<ref name="BIV"/><ref name="MLR" /> The philosopher of mind and language [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], despite his many differences of opinion with Putnam, wrote that semantic externalism constituted an "anti-subjectivist revolution" in philosophers' way of seeing the world. Since Descartes's time, philosophers had been concerned with proving knowledge from the basis of subjective experience. Thanks to Putnam, [[Saul Kripke]], [[Tyler Burge]] and others, Davidson said, philosophy could now take the objective realm for granted and start questioning the alleged "truths" of subjective experience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davidson |first=D. |year=2001 |title=Subjective, Intersubjective, Objective |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XPnCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA177 |pages=177–192 |isbn=88-7078-832-6}}</ref>

=== Theory of meaning ===
Along with Kripke, [[Keith Donnellan]], and others, Putnam contributed to what is known as the [[causal theory of reference]].<ref name="CR"/> In particular, he maintained in ''The Meaning of "Meaning"'' that the objects referred to by [[natural kind]] terms—such as "tiger", "water", and "tree"—are the principal elements of the meaning of such terms. There is a linguistic division of labor, analogous to [[Adam Smith]]'s economic division of labor, according to which such terms have their references fixed by the "experts" in the particular field of science to which the terms belong. So, for example, the reference of the term "lion" is fixed by the community of zoologists, the reference of the term "elm tree" is fixed by the community of botanists, and chemists fix the reference of the term "table salt" as sodium chloride. These referents are considered [[rigid designator]]s in the Kripkean sense and are disseminated outward to the linguistic community.<ref name="MLR"/><ref>Zelinsky-Wibbelt, C., ''Discourse and the Continuity of Reference: Representing Mental Categorization'' ([[Berlin]]: [[De Gruyter]], 2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=34a9pz1XyTUC&pg=PA33 p. 33].</ref>{{rp|33}}

Putnam specifies a finite sequence of elements (a vector) for the description of the meaning of every term in the language. Such a vector consists of four components:
# the object to which the term refers, e.g., the object individuated by the chemical formula H<sub>2</sub>O;
# a set of typical descriptions of the term, referred to as "the stereotype", e.g., "transparent", "colorless", and "hydrating";
# the semantic indicators that place the object into a general category, e.g., "natural kind" and "liquid";
# the syntactic indicators, e.g., "concrete noun" and "mass noun".

Such a "meaning-vector" provides a description of the reference and use of an expression within a particular linguistic community. It provides the conditions for its correct usage and makes it possible to judge whether a single speaker attributes the appropriate meaning to it or whether its use has changed enough to cause a difference in its meaning. According to Putnam, it is legitimate to speak of a change in the meaning of an expression only if the reference of the term, and not its stereotype, has changed.<ref name="Auxier"/>{{rp|339–340}} But since no possible algorithm can determine which aspect—the stereotype or the reference—has changed in a particular case, it is necessary to consider the usage of other expressions of the language.<ref name="MLR"/>{{Primary source inline|date=October 2022}} Since there is no limit to the number of such expressions to be considered, Putnam embraced a form of [[semantic holism]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Olismo |editor-first=Massimo |editor-last=Dell'Utri |publisher=Quodlibet |location=Macerata |year=2002 |isbn=88-86570-85-6}}</ref>

Despite the many changes in his other positions, Putnam consistently adhered to semantic holism. [[Michael Dummett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Ernest Lepore]], and others have identified problems with this position. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression in the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we will never be able to master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same expression, and therefore how any communication is possible between them. Given a sentence ''P'', since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and ''P'' is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, ''P'' means one thing to Fred and something else to Mary. Moreover, if ''P'' derives its meaning from its relations with all the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of ''P''. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that ''P'' has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if one accepts the truth of a sentence and then rejects it later on, the meaning of what one rejected and what one accepted are completely different and therefore one cannot change opinions with regard to the same sentences.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fodor |first1=J. |title=Holism: A Shopper's Guide |last2=Lepore |first2=E. |publisher=Blackwell |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-631-18192-7 |location=Oxford |oclc=644785316}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2023}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Dummett |first=Michael |title=The Logical Basis of Metaphysics |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-674-53785-9 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |oclc=21907992}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2023}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Penco |first=Carlo |title=Olismo |publisher=Quodlibet |year=2002 |isbn=88-86570-85-6 |editor-last=Dell'Utri |editor-first=Massimo |location=Macerata |chapter=Olismo e Molecularismo}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2023}}

== Philosophy of mathematics ==
In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], Putnam has utilized [[indispensability argument]]s to argue for a [[Mathematical realism|realist]] interpretation of mathematics. In his 1971 book ''Philosophy of Logic'', he presented what has since been called the [[wikt:locus classicus|''locus classicus'']] of the Quine–Putnam indispensability argument.<ref name="SEP-Colyvan" /> The argument, which he attributed to [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], is presented in the book as "quantification over mathematical entities is indispensable for science, both formal and physical; therefore we should accept such quantification; but this commits us to accepting the existence of the mathematical entities in question."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Putnam |first=Hilary |title=Philosophy of Logic |date=1971 |publisher=[[Harper & Row]] |isbn=9780061360428 |author-link=Hilary Putnam}}</ref> According to [[Charles Parsons (philosopher)|Charles Parsons]], Putnam "very likely" endorsed this version of the argument in his early work, but later came to deny some of the views present in it.<ref name="Hill2">{{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam |publisher=[[University of Arkansas Press]] |year=1992 |editor-last=Hill |editor-first=C.

In 1975, Putnam formulated his own indispensability argument based on the [[no miracles argument]] in the [[philosophy of science]], saying, "I believe that the positive argument for realism [in science] has an analogue in the case of mathematical realism. Here too, I believe, realism is the only philosophy that doesn't make the success of the science a miracle".<ref name=":4">{{Cite IEP|last=Marcus|first=Russell|author-link=Russell Marcus|url-id=indimath|title=The Indispensability Argument in the Philosophy of Mathematics|access-date=August 23, 2022}}</ref> According to Putnam, Quine's version of the argument was an argument for the existence of [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] mathematical objects, while Putnam's own argument was simply for a realist interpretation of mathematics, which he believed could be provided by a "mathematics as [[modal logic]]" interpretation that need not imply the existence of abstract objects.<ref name="Hill2" />{{Rp|61–62}}

Putnam also held the view that mathematics, like physics and other empirical sciences, uses both strict logical proofs and "[[quasi-empirical]]" methods.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hellman |first1=Geoffrey |author1-link=Geoffrey Hellman|title=Hilary Putnam on Logic and Mathematics |last2=Cook |first2=Roy T. |date=2018 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-96273-3 |oclc=1040620232}}</ref>{{Rp|page=150}} For example, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] states that for no [[integer]] <math>n>2</math> are there positive integer values of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' such that <math>x^n+y^n=z^n</math>.

These proofs inspired further research in the area, and formed a quasi-empirical consensus for the theorem. Even though such knowledge is more conjectural than a strictly proved theorem, it was still used in developing other mathematical ideas.<ref name="PutBen" />

The Quine–Putnam indispensability argument has been extremely influential in the philosophy of mathematics, inspiring continued debate and development of the argument in [[contemporary philosophy]] of mathematics. According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', many in the field consider it the best argument for mathematical realism.<ref name="SEP-Colyvan" /> Prominent counterarguments come from [[Hartry Field]], who argues that mathematics is not indispensable to science, and [[Penelope Maddy]] and [[Elliott Sober]], who dispute whether we are committed to mathematical realism even if it is indispensable to science.<ref name="SEP-Colyvan" />

== Mathematics and computer science ==
Putnam has contributed to scientific fields not directly related to his work in philosophy.<ref name="CR"/> As a mathematician, he contributed to the resolution of [[Hilbert's tenth problem]] in mathematics. This problem (now known as Matiyasevich's theorem or the MRDP theorem) was settled by [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] in 1970, with a proof that relied heavily on previous research by Putnam, [[Julia Robinson]] and [[Martin Davis (mathematician)|Martin Davis]].<ref>{{cite book|author-link=S.

In [[computability theory]], Putnam investigated the structure of the ramified [[analytical hierarchy]]<!-- link is not quite appropriate: the ''ramified'' analytical hierarchy is not the same as the analytical hierarchy; but Wikipedia has nothing more specific, so I think it is better to link here than to yet-to-be-written article -->, its connection with the [[Constructible universe|constructible hierarchy]] and its [[Turing degree]]s.

In [[computer science]], Putnam is known for the [[Davis–Putnam algorithm]] for the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] (SAT), developed with Martin Davis in 1960.<ref name="CR"/> The algorithm finds whether there is a set of true or false values that satisfies a given [[Boolean expression]] so that the entire expression becomes true. In 1962, they further refined the algorithm with the help of [[George Logemann]] and [[Donald W. Loveland]]. It became known as the [[DPLL algorithm]]. It is efficient and still forms the basis of most complete SAT solvers.<ref name="DandP"/>

== Epistemology ==
[[File:Brainvat.png|thumb|right|A "brain in a vat"—Putnam uses this thought experiment to argue that skeptical scenarios are impossible.]]

In [[epistemology]], Putnam is known for his argument against skeptical scenarios based on the "[[brain in a vat]]" thought experiment (a modernized version of [[Descartes]]'s [[evil demon]] hypothesis). The argument is that one cannot coherently suspect that one is a disembodied "brain in a vat" placed there by some "[[mad scientist]]".<ref name="BIV"/><ref name=":5">{{cite SEP|author-last=McKinsey|author-first=Michael|url-id=skepticism-content-externalism|title=Skepticism and Content Externalism|date=Summer 2018}}</ref>

This follows from the causal theory of reference. Words always refer to the kinds of things they were coined to refer to, the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, experienced. So, if some person, Mary, is a "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the mad scientist, then Mary's idea of a brain does not refer to a real brain, since she and her linguistic community have never encountered such a thing. To her a brain is actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Nor does her idea of a vat refer to a real vat. So if, as a brain in a vat, she says, "I'm a brain in a vat", she is actually saying, "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological [[externalism]]: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.<ref name=BIV/><ref name=":5" />

Putnam has clarified that his real target in this argument was never skepticism, but [[metaphysical realism]], which he thought implied such skeptical scenarios were possible.<ref>{{cite book|last=Putnam |first=H. |title=Realism and Reason.

The possibility that one is a recently disembodied brain in a vat is not undermined by semantic externalism. If a person has lived her entire life outside the vat—speaking the English language and interacting normally with the outside world—prior to her "envatment" by a mad scientist, when she wakes up inside the vat, her words and thoughts (e.g., "tree" and "grass") will still refer to the objects or events in the external world that they referred to before her envatment.<ref name="Wright" />

== Metaphilosophy and ontology <!--'Internal realism' and 'pragmatic realism' redirect here--> ==
In the late 1970s and the 1980s, stimulated by results from mathematical logic and by some of Quine's ideas, Putnam abandoned his long-standing defense of [[metaphysical realism]]—the view that the categories and structures of the external world are both causally and ontologically independent of the conceptualizations of the human mind—and adopted a rather different view, which he called "'''internal realism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->" or "'''pragmatic realism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->".<ref name=":7">{{Cite book |last=Künne |first=Wolfgang |title=Conceptions of Truth |date=2009 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-928019-3}}</ref>{{Rp|page=404}}<ref>{{cite journal|first=Ernest |last=Sosa |author-link=Ernest Sosa |title=Putnam's Pragmatic Realism |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=90 |number=12 |date=December 1993 |pages=605–626 |doi=10.2307/2940814 |jstor=2940814 |quote=Putnam argues against 'metaphysical realism' and in favor of his own 'internal (or pragmatic) realism.'}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Putnam |first=H. |title=The Many Faces of Realism |location=La Salle, Ill. |publisher=Open Court |year=1987 |isbn=0-8126-9043-5}}</ref> Internal realism is the view that, although the world may be ''causally'' independent of the human mind, the world's structure—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ''ontologically'' independent. The general idea is influenced by [[Immanuel Kant]]'s idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the [[Category (Kant)|categories of thought]].<ref name="Brown">{{cite journal| author=Curtis Brown |title=Internal Realism: Transcendental Idealism?|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/216385012.pdf|journal=[[Midwest Studies in Philosophy]]|issue=12|year=1988|volume=12 |pages=145–55 |doi=10.5840/msp19881238}}</ref>

According to Putnam, the problem with metaphysical realism is that it fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael |last=Devitt |author-link=Michael Devitt |title=Realism and Truth |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=1984 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXDODkIs2DYC&pg=PA331 |page=331 |isbn=978-0-691-07290-6 |oclc=10559172}}</ref> According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the categories, kinds and individuals inherent in the external world. But how is it possible that the world "carves up" into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two carvings perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that the human mind and its conceptual schemes impose structure on it.<ref name=":6" /> In ''Reason, Truth, and History'', Putnam identified truth with what he termed "idealized rational acceptability." The theory is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.<ref name="Human"/><ref name=":7" />{{Rp|location=§7.1}}

[[Nelson Goodman]] formulated a similar notion in ''Fact, Fiction and Forecast'' (1956). "We have come to think of the actual as one among many possible worlds. We need to repaint that picture. All possible worlds lie within the actual one", Goodman wrote.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goodman |first=N. |title=Fact, Fiction, and Forecast |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts & London |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1983 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC&pg=PA57 |page=57 |isbn=978-0-674-29071-6 |oclc=1090329720}}</ref> Putnam rejected this form of [[social constructivism]], but retained the idea that there can be many correct descriptions of reality. None of these descriptions can be scientifically proven to be the "one, true" description of the world. He thus accepted "conceptual relativity"—the view that it may be a matter of choice or convention, e.g., whether [[wiktionary:mereological|mereologic]]al sums exist, or whether spacetime points are individuals or mere limits.<ref name="Half">{{cite journal|author=Putnam, H.|title=A Half Century of Philosophy, Viewed from Within|journal=Daedalus|year=1997|volume=126|issue=1|pages=175–208|jstor=20027414}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=October 2022}}

Curtis Brown has criticized Putnam's internal realism as a disguised form of subjective [[idealism]], in which case it is subject to the traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of [[solipsism]]. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness ceased to exist, then the rest of the universe would also cease to exist.<ref name="Brown" /> In his reply to [[Simon Blackburn]] in the volume ''Reading Putnam'', Putnam renounced internal realism<ref name="CH" /> because it assumed a "cognitive interface" model of the relation between the mind and the world. Under the increasing influence of [[William James]] and the [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], he adopted a [[Naïve realism|direct realist]] view of this relation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Putnam |first=Hilary |date=September 1994 |title=The Dewey Lectures 1994: Sense, Nonsense, and the Senses: An Inquiry into the Powers of the Human Mind |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=91 |pages=445–518 |doi=10.2307/2940978 |jstor=2940978 |number=9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Pihlström |first=Sami |title=Encyclopedia of Sciences and Religions |publisher=Springer |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4020-8264-1 |editor-last=Runehov |editor-first=Anne L.

In the [[philosophy of perception]], Putnam came to endorse direct realism, according to which perceptual experiences directly present one with the external world. He once further held that there are no mental representations, [[sense data]], or other intermediaries between the mind and the world.<ref name="Three" /> By 2012, however, he rejected this commitment in favor of "[[transactionalism]]", a view that accepts both that perceptual experiences are world-involving transactions, and that these transactions are functionally describable (provided that worldly items and intentional states may be referred to in the specification of the function). Such transactions can further involve [[qualia]].<ref name="blog" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Putnam |first=H. |title=Philosophy in an Age of Science |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-674-05013-6 |editor-last1=De Caro |editor-first1=M. |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |chapter=How to Be a Sophisticated "Naive Realist" |oclc=913024858 |editor-last2=Macarthur |editor-first2=D.}}</ref>

== Neopragmatism and Wittgenstein ==
In the mid-1970s, Putnam became increasingly disillusioned with what he perceived as modern [[analytic philosophy]]'s "[[scientism]]" and focus on metaphysics over ethics and everyday concerns.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaynesford |first=R.
