==Early life and education==
Posner was born on January 11, 1939, in [[New York City]].  His father's family were of [[Romanian Jewish]] descent, and his mother's family were [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from Galicia in the [[Austrian Empire]].<ref>[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MJYY-638 FamilySearch.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.igreens.org.uk/richard_posner.htm ''The Bench Burner: An interview with Richard Posner''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509143331/http://www.igreens.org.uk/richard_posner.htm |date=May 9, 2007 }}, Reprint of article from ''New Yorker'' by [[Larissa MacFarquhar]], Dec. 10, 2001: "Posner grew up in New York – first in Manhattan and then in Scarsdale. His mother's relatives were Jews from Vienna who looked down on his father's family, which was from Romania and poorer than they were. 'They were all poor,' Posner says, 'but my mothers family had toilet paper, and my father's family had newspaper.' " As shown on original sources freely available at FamilySearch.org, Posner's mother's family was actually from Husiatyn in the Austrian Empire (not Vienna), which is now in Ukraine.</ref>

After high school, Posner studied [[English literature]] at [[Yale University]], graduating in 1959 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], ''[[Latin honors#United States|summa cum laude]]'', and membership in [[Phi Beta Kappa]].  He then attended [[Harvard Law School]], where he was president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. He graduated in 1962 ranked first in his class with an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]], ''magna cum laude''.<ref name="cnn1">{{cite news

His analysis of the [[Lewinsky scandal]] cut across most party and ideological divisions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}} Posner's greatest influence is through his writings on law and economics; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called him "one of the most important [[antitrust]] scholars of the past half-century."

Posner was mentioned in 2005 as a [[George W. Bush Supreme Court candidates|potential nominee]] to replace [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] because of his prominence as a scholar and an appellate judge. Robert S. Boynton wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that he believed Posner would never sit on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] because despite his "obvious brilliance," he would be criticized for his occasionally "outrageous conclusions," such as his contention "that the [[rule of law]] is an accidental and dispensable element of legal ideology," his argument that buying and selling children on the [[free market]] would lead to better outcomes than the present situation, government-regulated [[adoption]], and his support for the legalization of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[LSD]].<ref name=Boynton>Boynton, Robert S.

==Legal and philosophical positions==
[[File:Posneratftc.jpg|thumb|275px|Judge Posner making a dinner speech at the [[Federal Trade Commission]]]]

In Posner's youth and in the 1960s as law clerk to William J. Brennan, he was generally counted as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. However, in reaction to some of the perceived excesses of the late 1960s, Posner developed a strongly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] bent. He encountered [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]] economists [[Aaron Director]] and [[George Stigler]] while a professor at [[Stanford]].<ref name="cnn1" /> Posner summarized his views on law and economics in his 1973 book ''The Economic Analysis of Law''.<ref name="cnn1" />

Today, although generally viewed as to [[Right-wing politics|the right]] in academia, Posner's [[pragmatism]], his qualified [[moral relativism]] and [[moral skepticism]],<ref>{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Posner |title=The Problematics of Moral and Legal Theory |volume=111 |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |issue=7 |pages=1637, 1642–1646 |year=1998 |jstor=1342477 |doi=10.2307/1342477 |url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/journal_articles/7091 }} (clarifying his moral positions)</ref> and his affection for the thought of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] set him apart from most American conservatives.  As a judge, with the exception of his rulings with respect to the sentencing guidelines and the recording of police actions, Posner's judicial votes have always placed him on the moderate-to-liberal wing of the Republican Party, where he has become more isolated over time. In July 2012, Posner stated, "I've become less conservative since the Republican Party started becoming goofy."<ref>Nina Totenberg, [https://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/07/05/156319272/federal-judge-richard-posner-the-gop-has-made-me-less-conservative Federal Judge Richard Posner: The GOP Has Made Me Less Conservative] [[NPR]], July 5, 2012</ref> Among Posner's judicial influences are the American jurists [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] and [[Learned Hand]]; he has written that "Holmes is the greatest jurist ... because the sum of his ideas, metaphors, decisions, dissents and other contributions exceeds the sum of contributions of any other jurist of modern times",<ref>{{Cite book |last=Domnarski |first=William |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IN_eDAAAQBAJ&dq=posner+holmes+%22modern+times%22&pg=PT136 |title=Richard Posner |date=2016-08-25 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-933233-5 |language=en}}</ref> and he has applied the [[Calculus of negligence|Hand formula]] in a number of his opinions.<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=Theoretical Inquiries in Law|volume=4|last=Wright |first=Richard W. |year=2003 |title=Hand, Posner, and the Myth of the 'Hand Formula' |doi=10.2202/1565-3404.1063|ssrn=362800|s2cid=201282702|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=362800 |language=en}}</ref>

In June 2016, Posner was criticized by right-wing media organizations for a column he wrote for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in which he stated, "I see absolutely no value to a judge of spending decades, years, months, weeks, day, hours, minutes, or seconds studying the Constitution, the history of its enactment, its amendments, and its implementation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2016/supreme_court_breakfast_table_for_june_2016/law_school_professors_need_more_practical_experience.html?wpsrc=sh_all_mob_tw_top|title=Supreme Court Breakfast Table|first=Richard A.|last=Posner|date=June 24, 2016|work=Slate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/federal-judge-u-s-constitution-is-outdated-judges-should-stop-studying-it/|title=Federal Judge: U.S. Constitution Is Outdated, Judges Should Stop Studying It|website=www.mediaite.com}}</ref>

He has called his approach to judging pragmatic. "I pay very little attention to legal rules, statutes, constitutional provisions. ... A case is just a dispute. The first thing you do is ask yourself—forget about the law—what is a sensible resolution of this dispute? The next thing ... is to see if a recent Supreme Court precedent or some other legal obstacle stood in the way of ruling in favor of that sensible resolution. And the answer is that's actually rarely the case. When you have a Supreme Court case or something similar, they're often extremely easy to get around."<ref>{{cite news |title=An Exit Interview With Richard Posner, Judicial Provocateur (Published 2017) |work=The New York Times |date=September 11, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/us/politics/judge-richard-posner-retirement.html?module=WatchingPortal&region=c-column-middle-span-region&pgType=Homepage&action=click&mediaId=thumb_square&state=standard&contentPlacement=2&version=internal&contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F09%2F11%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fjudge-richard-posner-retirement.html&eventName=Watching-article-click |last1=Liptak |first1=Adam }}</ref>

===Abortion===
Posner has written several opinions sympathetic to [[abortion rights]], including a decision that held that late term abortion was constitutionally protected in some circumstances.<ref>[[Alissa J. Rubin|Rubin, Alissa]] (1999-02-11) [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-feb-11-mn-7143-story.html Anti-Abortion Advocates Gain Ground in Late-Term Debate], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref>

In November 2015, Posner authored a decision in ''Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin v. Schimel'' striking down regulations on abortion clinics in Wisconsin.  He rejected the state's argument that the laws were written to protect the health of women and not to make abortion more difficult to obtain.  Accusing the state of indirectly trying to ban abortions in the state Posner wrote, "They [Wisconsin] may do this in the name of protecting the health of women who have abortions, yet as in this case the specific measures they support may do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion."<ref>{{cite web|title=Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin v. Brad Schimel|url=http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2015/D11-23/C:15-1736:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1661222:S:0|access-date=15 December 2015}}</ref>

===Animal rights===
Posner rejects an ethic of strong animal rights on pragmatic grounds (where such an ethic posits the moral irrelevance of species membership).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Posner |first1=Richard |title=Animal Rights |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2001/06/animal-rights-3.html |website=[[Slate Magazine]] |access-date=9 August 2022 |language=en |date=12 June 2001}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=August 2022}} He recognizes the philosophical force of arguments for strong animal rights, but maintains that human intuition about the paramount value of human life makes it impossible to accommodate an ethic of strong animal rights. Posner, a self-avowed moral anti-realist,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Posner|first=Richard|title=The Problematics of Moral and Legal Theory|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2828&context=journal_articles|journal=Harvard Law Review|year=1998|volume=111|issue=7|pages=1637–1717|doi=10.2307/1342477|jstor=1342477}}</ref> does not present his critique of strong animal rights as a deductive proof. Instead, he highlights the practical importance of intuition and emotion over abstract argument.

In a 2000 ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' book review on the title "Rattling the Cage" by [[Steven M. Wise]], Posner again criticized the legal notion of animal rights. In the review, Posner argues that Wise's approach, using the cognitive ability of animals compared to that of very young normal human beings as a basis for rights-worthiness, is arbitrary and in contrast with major traditional and contemporary philosophies (including the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]] for one and [[utilitarianism]] for another). In addition, he points out that this basis for rights has problematic implications—including that it might soon make some computers more worthy of rights than some humans, a conclusion he calls absurd. Posner goes on to reason that granting human-like rights to animals is fraught with implications which could radically disrupt or devalue the rights of human beings. He alludes to Hitler's zoophilia as evidence that respect for animals and humaneness toward human beings are not necessarily associated. Arguing that the analogy of animal rights to the civil rights movement lacks imagination and is not very apt, Posner posits that animal welfare might be better protected by other legal models, one example of which would be stronger laws making animals property, since, he asserts, people tend to protect what they own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/378_vgs9bdkn.pdf|title=Animal Rights}}</ref>

Posner engaged in a debate with the philosopher [[Peter Singer]] in 2001 at ''[[Slate magazine]].'' He agrees that "gratuitous cruelty to and neglect of animals is wrong and that some costs should be incurred to reduce the suffering of animals raised for food or other human purposes or subjected to medical or other testing and experimentation," but rejects grounding this view in an ethic of strong animal rights, contending that such a premise entails conclusions inconsistent with the reality of human society and psychology. He further states that people whose opinions were changed by consideration of the philosophical arguments presented in Singer's book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' failed to see the "radicalism of the ethical vision that powers [their] view on animals, an ethical vision that finds greater value in a healthy pig than in a profoundly retarded child, that commands inflicting a lesser pain on a human being to avert a greater pain to a dog, and that, provided only that a chimpanzee has 1 percent of the mental ability of a normal human being, would require the sacrifice of the human being to save 101 chimpanzees."<ref name="Slate">{{Cite web|title=Animal Rights Debate: Peter Singer vs Richard Posner|url=https://famous-trials.com/animalrights/2601-animal-rights-debate-peter-singer-vs-richard-posner|access-date=2021-05-07|website=Originally Published on [[Slate magazine]].}}</ref>

Posner emphasizes the importance of facts over arguments in creating social change. He states that his moral intuition says that "it is wrong to give as much weight to a dog's pain as to an infant's pain," and that "[this] is a moral intuition deeper than any reason that could be given for it and impervious to any reason that you or anyone could give against it." Instead, Posner claims that "[expanding and invigorating] the laws that protect animals will require not philosophical arguments for reducing human beings to the level of the other animals but facts, facts that will stimulate a greater empathetic response to animal suffering and facts that will alleviate concern about the human costs of further measures to reduce animal suffering."<ref name=Slate/>

===Antitrust===
Along with [[Robert Bork]], Posner helped shape the antitrust policy changes of the 1970s through his idea that 1960s antitrust laws were in fact making prices higher for the consumer rather than lower, while he viewed lower prices as the essential end goal of any antitrust policy.<ref name="cnn1"/> Posner's and Bork's theories on antitrust evolved into the prevailing view in academia and at the Justice Department in the George H. W. Bush administration; they have remained the consensus view in both the Justice Department and among legal academics of antitrust.<ref name="cnn1"/>

===''The Bluebook''===
''[[Bluebook|The Bluebook]]'' is the style guide that prescribes the most widely used legal citation system in the United States. Posner is "one of the founding fathers of ''Bluebook'' abolitionism, having advocated it for almost twenty-five years, ever since his 1986 ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'' article<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=1599750|title=Goodbye to the Bluebook|first=Richard A.|last=Posner|date=July 29, 1986|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|volume=53|issue=4|pages=1343–1368|doi=10.2307/1599750}}</ref> on the subject."<ref name=VC>Somin, Ilya (2011-01-25) [http://volokh.com/2011/01/25/richard-posner-on-the-bluebook/ Richard Posner on the Bluebook], ''[[Volokh Conspiracy]]''</ref> In a 2011 ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' article, he wrote:

<blockquote>''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation'' exemplifies hypertrophy in the anthropological sense. It is a monstrous growth, remote from the functional need for legal citation forms, that serves obscure needs of the legal culture and its student subculture.<ref>[http://www.yalelawjournal.org/review/the-bluebook-blues The ''Bluebook'' Blues, 120 Yale L.J. 850 (2011)]</ref></blockquote>

He describes those needs as unrelated to practical legal activity but instead as social and political.

In the same article, Posner gives an excerpt of the entire citation style guide included (as an appendix) in the short manual he gives his own law clerks (whom he describes as "very smart"); the appendix is about 2–3 pages long, and he says the entire manual is about 1% as long as the Bluebook.

===Drugs===
Posner opposes the U.S. "[[War on Drugs]]" and called it "[[quixotism|quixotic]]". In a 2003 [[CNBC]] interview he discussed the difficulty of enforcing criminal [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] laws, and asserted that it is hard to justify the criminalization of marijuana when compared to other substances.  In a talk at [[Elmhurst College]] in 2012, Posner said that "I don't think that we should have a fraction of the drug laws that we have. I think it's really absurd to be criminalizing possession or use or distribution of marijuana."<ref>{{YouTube|id=AhBBV0aI7lM#t=3247s}}</ref>

=== National security ===
At the ''Cybercrime 2020: The Future of Online Crime and Investigations'' conference held at [[Georgetown University Law Center]] on November 20, 2014, Posner, in addition to further reinforcing his views on privacy being over-rated, stated that "If the NSA wants to vacuum all the trillions of bits of information that are crawling through the electronic worldwide networks, I think that's fine. ... Much of what passes for the name of privacy is really just trying to conceal the disreputable parts of your conduct," Posner added. "Privacy is mainly about trying to improve your social and business opportunities by concealing the sorts of bad activities that would cause other people not to want to deal with you." Posner also criticized [[mobile OS]] companies for enabling [[end-to-end encryption]] in their newest software. "I'm shocked at the thought that a company would be permitted to manufacture an electronic product that the government would not be able to search" he said.<ref>{{citation|title=Judge: Give NSA unlimited access to digital data |date=December 4, 2014|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2855776/judge-give-nsa-unlimited-access-to-digital-data.html}}</ref>

===Patent and copyright law===
Posner has expressed concerns, on the blog he contributed to with Gary Becker, that both patent and copyright protection, though particularly the former, may be excessive. He argues that the cost of inventing must be compared to the cost of copying in order to determine the optimal patent protection for an inventor. When patent protection is too strongly in favor of the inventor, market efficiency is decreased. He illustrates his argument by comparing the pharmaceutical industry (where the cost of invention is high) with the software industry (where the cost of invention is relatively low).<ref>{{cite web

===Police recording===
As part of a three-judge panel on the 7th Circuit weighing a challenge to the Illinois Eavesdropping Act, which bars the secret recording of conversations without the consent of all the parties to the conversation, Posner was to deliver another memorable quote. At issue was the constitutionality of the Illinois wiretapping law, which makes it illegal to record someone without consent even when filming public acts like arrests in public. Posner interrupted the [[ACLU]] after just 14 words, stating, "Yeah, I know. But I'm not interested, really, in what you want to do with these recordings of peoples' encounters with the police. ..." Posner continued: "Once all this stuff can be recorded, there's going to be a lot more of this snooping around by reporters and bloggers. ... I'm always suspicious when the civil liberties people start telling the police how to do their business."<ref>{{cite web |title=Tell Us, Judge Posner, Who Watches the Watchmen? |author=Justin Silverman |publisher=suffolkmedialaw.com |url=http://suffolkmedialaw.com/2011/09/27/tell-us-judge-posner-who-watches-the-watchmen/ |access-date=November 8, 2011 |archive-date=March 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316133526/http://suffolkmedialaw.com/2011/09/27/tell-us-judge-posner-who-watches-the-watchmen/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The 7th Circuit upheld the challenge, 2–1, striking down the Eavesdropping Act, but Posner wrote a dissenting opinion.

===Prisoners===
In a dissent from an earlier ruling by his protégé [[Frank Easterbrook]], Posner wrote that Easterbrook's decision that female guards could watch male prisoners while in the shower or bathroom must stem from a belief that prisoners are "members of a different species, indeed as a type of [[vermin]], devoid of [[human dignity]] and entitled to no respect. ... I do not myself consider the 1.5 million inmates of American prisons and jails in that light."<ref name="cnn1"/><ref>''Johnson v. Phelan'', 69 F.3d 144, 151 (7th Cir. 1995) (Posner, J., dissenting).</ref>

===Race and public education===
Posner's views of public education policy are informed by his view that groups of students differ in intellectual ability, and therefore, that it is faulty to impose uniform educational standards on all schools. His view in this regard is undergirded by his view that different races differ in intelligence. (However, Posner says that he thinks it is "highly unlikely" that these differences are rooted in genetics, rather than environment.){{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

In a blog post, Posner wrote, "I suggest that the only worthwhile reforms of teacher compensation are raising teacher wages uniformly, providing recognition and modest bonuses for outstanding teachers, and increasing hiring standards."<ref>{{citation|title=Rating Teachers – Posner|url=http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2012/09/rating-teachersposner.html}}</ref>
In the same post, he wrote, "I am not clear what we should think the problem of American education (below the college level) is. Most children of middle-class ... Americans are white or Asian and attend good public or private schools, usually predominantly white. The average white IQ is of course 100 and the Asian (like the Jewish) almost one standard deviation higher, that is, 115. The average black IQ is 85, a full standard deviation below the white average, and the average Hispanic IQ has been estimated recently at 89. Black children in particular often come from disordered households, which has a negative effect on ability to learn and perhaps indeed on IQ. ... Increasingly, black and Hispanic students find themselves in schools with few white or Asian students. The challenge to American education is to provide a useful education to the large number of Americans who are unlikely to benefit from a college education or from high school courses aimed at preparing students for college."

===Same-sex marriage===
In September 2014, Posner authored the opinions in the consolidated cases of ''[[Wolf v. Walker]]'' and ''[[Baskin v. Bogan]]'' challenging Wisconsin and Indiana's state level same-sex marriage bans.  The opinion of the three-judge panel on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that [[Indiana]] and [[Wisconsin]]'s bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional, affirming a lower court ruling.<ref name="South Bend Voice"/> During oral arguments, Wisconsin's attorney general cited tradition as a reason for maintaining the ban, prompting Posner to note that: "It was tradition to not allow blacks and whites to marry—a tradition that got swept away." Though Posner argued in his 1992 book ''[[Sex and Reason]]'' that prohibitions against gay marriage were rationally justified, he held in the 2014 cases that the [[same-sex marriage]] bans were both "a tradition of hate" and "savage discrimination".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Kyle|title=Appeals Court Judge Calls Indiana's Same-Sex Marriage Ban 'Tradition of Hate'|url=http://southbendvoice.com/2014/08/26/appeals-court-judge-calls-indianas-same-sex-marriage-ban-tradition-of-hate/|access-date=4 September 2014|publisher=South Bend Voice}}</ref>  Posner wrote the opinion for the unanimous panel, finding the laws unconstitutional under the [[Equal Protection Clause]].  The Supreme Court then denied a writ of certiorari and left Posner's ruling to stand.

===Torture===
When reviewing [[Alan Dershowitz]]'s book, ''Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge'', Posner wrote in the September 2002 ''[[The New Republic]]'', "If torture is the only means of obtaining the information necessary [[ticking time bomb scenario|to prevent the detonation of a nuclear bomb]] in [[Times Square]], torture should be used{{snd}}and will be used{{snd}}to obtain the information.... No one who doubts that this is the case should be in a position of responsibility."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/review/2002_09_05.html |title=Review-a-Day – Why Terrorism Works Understanding The by Alan M Dershowitz, reviewed by The New Republic Online – Powell's Books |first=Richard A. |last=Posner |work=powells.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023012718/http://www.powells.com/review/2002_09_05.html |archive-date=October 23, 2012 |date=September 5, 2002 }}</ref>

===Voter identification laws===
In 2007, Posner wrote the majority opinion upholding Indiana's photo identification law in the ''[[Crawford v. Marion County Election Board]]'' case. He wrote that "absence of prosecutions" for voter fraud is explained in part by "the extreme difficulty of apprehending a voter impersonator," and that such impersonators are "almost impossible to catch without a voter ID requirement".<ref name="columbialawreview_2014">{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Michael D.|date=September 5, 2014|title=The Problem of Voter Fraud|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2488645|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=115|issue=3|pages=739–75}}Virginia Public Law and Legal Theory Research Paper No. 2014-56; Virginia Law and Economics Research Paper No. 2014-15.</ref> The law was subsequently upheld at the [[United States Supreme Court]]. In 2013, Posner disavowed support for the ruling due to concerns about [[voter suppression]] caused by the law. He stated that judges "weren’t given the information that would enable that balance to be struck" between preventing fraud and protecting voters’ rights.<ref name="r781">{{cite web | last=Schwartz | first=John | title=Judge in Landmark Case Disavows Support for Voter ID | website=The New York Times | date=2013-10-16 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/us/politics/judge-in-landmark-case-disavows-support-for-voter-id.html | access-date=2024-09-02}}</ref> In 2014, Posner wrote a 30-page dissent opposing the upholding of a Wisconsin voter ID law.<ref name="m088">{{cite web | last=Hiltzik | first=Michael | title=A conservative judge's devastating take on why voter ID laws are evil | website=Los Angeles Times | date=2014-10-13 | url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-why-voter-id-laws-are-evil-20141013-column.html | access-date=2024-09-02}}</ref>

In 1999, Posner was welcomed as a private [[mediation|mediator]] among the parties involved in the [[United States v. Microsoft|Microsoft antitrust case]].<ref name="nytimes"/>

A study published by Fred Shapiro in the University of Chicago's ''Journal of Legal Studies'' found that Posner is the most-cited legal scholar of all time by a considerable margin, as Posner's work has generated 7,981 cites compared to the runner-up [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s 4,488 cites.<ref name=ShapiroJLS/> In 2021, Shapiro found that Posner maintained his position as the most cited legal scholar and grew his lead, generating 48,852 cites to runner-up [[Cass Sunstein]]'s 35,584.<ref name = "alltime"/> Aside from the sheer volume of his output, Posner's opinions enjoy great respect from other judges, based on citations, and within the legal academy, where his opinions are taught in many foundational law courses.

===Notable cases===
In his decision in the 1997 case ''[[State Oil Co. v. Khan]]'', Posner wrote that a ruling 1968 antitrust precedent set by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] was "moth-eaten", "wobbly", and "unsound".<ref name="cnn1"/> Nevertheless, he abided by the previous decision in his ruling.<ref name="cnn1"/> The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] and overturned the 1968 ruling unanimously; [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] wrote the opinion and spoke positively of both Posner's criticism and his decision to abide by the ruling until the Court decided to change it.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news
