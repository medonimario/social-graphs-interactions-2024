'''François Marie Charles Fourier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ʊr|i|eɪ|,_|-|i|ər}};<ref>{{Dictionary.com|Fourier}}</ref> {{IPA|fr|ʃaʁl fuʁje|lang}}; 7 April 1772 – 10 October 1837) was a French [[philosopher]], an influential early [[socialism|socialist]] thinker, and one of the founders of [[utopian socialism]]. Some of his views, held to be radical in his lifetime, have become mainstream in modern society. For instance, Fourier is credited with having originated the word ''[[feminism]]'' in 1837.<ref>[[#Reference-idGoldstein1982|Goldstein 1982]], p. 92.</ref>

Fourier's social views and proposals inspired a whole movement of [[intentional communities]]. Among them in the United States were the community of [[Utopia, Ohio]]; [[La Reunion (Dallas)|La Reunion]] near present-day [[Dallas, Texas]]; [[Lake Zurich, Illinois]]; the [[North American Phalanx]] in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]]; [[Brook Farm]] in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]]; the [[Community Place]] and [[Alasa Farms|Sodus Bay Phalanx]] in New York State; [[Silkville, Kansas]], and several others. In [[Guise]], France, he influenced the {{ill|Familistery of Guise|fr|Familistère de Guise|de|Familistère|pt|Familistério de Godin}}. Fourier later inspired a diverse array of revolutionary thinkers and writers.

==Life==
Fourier was born in [[Besançon]], France, on 7 April 1772.<ref name= "ReferenceA">[[#Reference-idSerenyi1967|Serenyi 1967]], p. 278.</ref> The son of a small businessman, Fourier was more interested in architecture than in his father's trade.<ref name= "ReferenceA" /> He wanted to become an engineer, but the local military engineering school accepted only sons of noblemen.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Fourier later said he was grateful that he did not pursue engineering because it would have taken too much time away from his efforts to help humanity.<ref>[[#Reference-idPellarin1846|Pellarin 1846]], p. 14.</ref>

When his father died in 1781, Fourier received two-fifths of his father's estate, valued at more than 200,000 [[francs]].<ref>[[#Reference-idPellarin1846|Pellarin 1846]], p. 7.</ref> This enabled Fourier to travel throughout Europe at his leisure. In 1791 he moved from Besançon to [[Lyon]], where he was employed by the merchant M. Bousquet.<ref name= "ReferenceC">[[#Reference-idPellarin1846|Pellarin 1846]], p. 235.</ref> Fourier's travels also brought him to Paris, where he worked as the head of the [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|Office of Statistics]] for a few months.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> From 1791 to 1816 Fourier was employed in Paris, [[Rouen]], Lyon, [[Marseille]], and [[Bordeaux]].<ref>[[#Reference-idPellarin1846|Pellarin 1846]], pp. 235–236.</ref> As a traveling salesman and correspondence clerk, his research and thought was time-limited: he complained of "serving the knavery of merchants" and the stupefaction of "deceitful and degrading duties." 

He began writing. His first book was published in 1808 but sold few copies. After six years, it fell into the hands of Monsieur Just Muiron, who eventually became Fourier's patron. Fourier produced most of his writings between 1816 and 1821. In 1822, he tried to sell his books again but with no success.<ref>{{Cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NcO7t8G-yQ8C&q=Fran%C3%A7ois+Marie+Charles+Fourier%27s+first+book+was+published+in+1808&pg=PA535|title=Faces in the Street|last=Wilson|first=Pip| year= 2006| publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781430300212|language= en| via= Google Books}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}

==Ideas==<!-- This section is targeted by several Fourierite links -->
Fourier declared that concern and [[cooperation]] are the keys to social success. He believed that a society that cooperated would see an immense improvement in its productivity. Workers would be recompensed for their labor according to their contribution. Fourier saw such cooperation occurring in communities he called "phalanxes", based upon structures called [[Phalanstère]]s or "grand hotels". These buildings were four-level apartment complexes where the richest had the uppermost apartments and the poorest had ground-floor residences. Wealth was determined by one's job; jobs were assigned based on interest and desire. There were incentives: jobs people might not enjoy doing would receive higher pay. Fourier considered [[trade]], which he associated with Jews, the "source of all evil", and advocated that Jews be forced to perform farm work in the phalansteries.<ref>{{cite book| first= Richard H.| last= Roberts| title= Religion and the Transformations of Capitalism: Comparative Approaches| publisher= Routledge| year= 1995| page= 90}}</ref> By the end of his life, Fourier advocated the return of Jews to Palestine with the assistance of the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].<ref name="Rubenstein Roth 1987 pp. 70–71">{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Richard L. |author-link=John K.

Roth]] and [[Richard L. Rubenstein]] see Fourier as motivated by economic and religious antisemitism rather than the [[racial antisemitism]] that emerged later in the century.<ref name="Rubenstein Roth 1987 pp. 70–71" />
===Attack on civilization===
Fourier characterized poverty (not inequality) as the principal cause of disorder in society, and proposed to eradicate it by sufficiently high wages and a "decent minimum" for those unable to work.<ref>[[#Reference-idCunliffe2001|Cunliffe 2001]], p. 461.</ref> He used the word "civilization" in a pejorative sense; as such, "Fourier's contempt for the respectable thinkers and ideologies of his age was so intense that he always used the terms philosopher and civilization in a pejorative sense. In his lexicon civilization was a depraved order, a synonym for perfidy and constraint ... Fourier's attack on civilization had qualities not to be found in the writing of any other social critic of his time."<ref>{{cite book| first= Johnathan| last= Beecher| title= Charles Fourier: The Visionary and His World| publisher= University of California Press| year= 1986| pages= 195–196}}</ref>

===Work and liberated passions===
For [[Herbert Marcuse]] "The idea of libidinal work relations in a developed industrial society finds little support in the tradition of thought, and where such support is forthcoming it seems of a dangerous nature. The transformation of labor into pleasure is the central idea in Fourier's giant socialist utopia."<ref name= Eros>{{cite book| first= Herbert| last= Marcuse| title= Eros and Civilization | publisher= Beacon Press| place= Boston| year= 1955| title-link= Eros and Civilization}}</ref>{{rp|217}}
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=Fourier insists that this transformation requires a complete change in the social institutions: distribution of the social product according to need, assignment of functions according to individual faculties and inclinations, constant mutation of functions, short work periods, and so on. But the possibility of "attractive labor" (''travail attrayant'') derives above all from the release of libidinal forces . Fourier assumes the existence of an ''attraction industrielle'' which makes for pleasurable co-operation. It is based on the attraction passionnée in the nature of man, which persists despite the opposition of reason, duty, prejudice. This ''attraction passionnée'' tends toward three principal objectives: the creation of "luxury, or the pleasure of the five senses"; the formation of libidinal groups (of friendship and love); and the establishment of a harmonious order, organizing these groups for work in accordance with the development of the individual "passions" (internal and external "play" of faculties).<ref name= Eros />{{rp|217}}}}
Fourier believed that there were 12 common passions, which resulted in 810 types of character, so the ideal phalanx would have 1,620 people.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fourier |first1=Charles |editor1-last=Beecher |editor1-first=Jonathan |editor2-last=Bienvenu |editor2-first=Richard |title=The Utopian Vision of Charles Fourier Selected Texts on Work, Love and Passionate Attraction |date=1971 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=9780807015384 |page=220}}</ref> One day there would be six million of these, loosely ruled by a world "[[omniarch]]", or (later) a [[World Congress of Phalanxes]]. He had a concern for the sexually rejected; jilted suitors would be led away by a corps of ''fairies'' who would soon cure them of their lovesickness, and visitors could consult the card-index of ''personality types'' for suitable partners for casual sex. He also defended homosexuality as a personal preference for some people. Anarchist [[Hakim Bey]] describes Fourier's ideas as follows: 
<blockquote>In Fourier's system of Harmony all creative activity including industry, craft, agriculture, etc. will arise from liberated passion—this is the famous theory of "attractive labor." Fourier sexualizes work itself—the life of the [[Phalanstery]] is a continual orgy of intense feeling, intellection, & activity, a society of lovers & wild enthusiasts.<ref name= Lemonade>{{cite web| author-link= Hakim Bey| first= Hakim| last= Bey| url= http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__The_Lemonade_Ocean___Modern_Times.html |title= The Lemonade Ocean & Modern Times|year= 1991| access-date= January 16, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

===Women's rights===
Fourier supported [[women's rights]]. He believed that all important jobs should be open to women on the basis of skill and aptitude rather than closed on account of gender. He spoke of women as individuals, not as half the human couple. Fourier saw that "traditional" marriage could potentially hurt woman's rights as human beings and thus never married.<ref>[[#Reference-idDenslow1880|Denslow 1880]], p. 172.</ref> Writing before the advent of the term "homosexuality", he held that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences, which may change throughout their lives, including same-sex attraction and ''androgénité''. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused, and that "affirming one's difference" can actually enhance social integration.<ref name="Fourier Debout-Oleszkiewicz 1967">{{cite book |last=Fourier |first=Charles |editor-last=Debout-Oleszkiewicz |editor-first=Simone |title=Le Nouveau monde amoureux |trans-title=The New World of Love |publisher=Editions Anthropos |publication-place=Paris |year=1967 |orig-year=1818 |oclc=4930481 |language=fr |pages=389, 391, 429, 458, 459, 462, and 463 |url=https://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/fourier_charles/nouveau_monde_amoureux/nouveau_monde_amoureux.html |access-date=2023-10-18 |archive-date=2023-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230805142035/https://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/fourier_charles/nouveau_monde_amoureux/nouveau_monde_amoureux.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Fourier's concern was to liberate every human being, in two senses: through education and by liberating human passion.<ref>[[#Reference-idGoldstein1982|Goldstein 1982]], p. 98.</ref>

===Children and education===
Fourier felt that "civilized" parents and teachers saw children as little idlers.<ref name="historyguide.org">{{Cite book |url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/fourier.html |title=Socialist Thought: A Documentary History |date=1964 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0231082657 |editor-last=Fried |editor-first=Albert |location=New York |publication-date=1964 |pages=129–151 |access-date=2005-11-25 |editor-last2=Sanders |editor-first2=Ronald |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230305220856/http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/fourier.html |archive-date=2023-03-05}}</ref> But he himself believed that children as early as age two and three were very industrious. He listed children's dominant tastes as including:

#Rummaging or inclination to handle everything, examine everything, look through everything, to constantly change occupations;
#Industrial commotion, taste for noisy occupations;
#Aping or imitative mania.
#Industrial miniature, a taste for miniature workshops.
#Progressive attraction of the weak toward the strong.<ref name="historyguide.org" />

=== Utopian aspirations ===
Fourier was deeply disturbed by the disorder of his time and wanted to stabilize the course of events. He saw a world full of strife, chaos, and disorder.<ref>[[#Reference-idSerenyi1967|Serenyi 1967]], p. 279.</ref>

Fourier is best remembered for his writings on a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]] based on unity of action and harmonious collaboration.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> He is also known for certain utopian pronouncements, such as that the seas would lose their [[salinity]] and turn to [[lemonade]],<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fourier |first=Charles |url=http://www.autodidactproject.org/quote/fourier_lemonade.html |title=Théorie des quatre mouvements et des destinées générales |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Gareth Stedman |publication-date=1996 |pages=50 |translator-last=Patterson |translator-first=Ian |trans-title=Theory of the Four Movements |access-date=2024-01-12 |editor-last2=Patterson |editor-first2=Ian |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125225354/http://www.autodidactproject.org/quote/fourier_lemonade.html |archive-date=2018-01-25}}</ref> and a coincidental view of [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Goldstein |first=Amanda Jo |date=2019 |title=Attracting the Earth: Climate Justice for Charles Fourier |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/761288 |journal=Diacritics |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=74–105 |doi=10.1353/dia.2019.0027 |s2cid=239435739 |via=Project MUSE}}</ref> that the [[North Pole]] would be milder than the Mediterranean in a future phase of Perfect Harmony.<ref name="historyguide.org" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kreis |first=Steven |date=2009-08-03 |title=Lectures on Modern European Intellectual History: Lecture 21: The Utopian Socialists: Charles Fourier |url=https://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/twimberley/EnviroPhilo/Fourier.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240113025327/https://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/twimberley/EnviroPhilo/Fourier.pdf |archive-date=2024-01-13 |access-date=2024-01-12 |website=The History Guide}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2016}}

===Antisemitism===
{{See also|Antisemitism}}
Fourier said Jews were "the leprosy and the ruin of the body politic".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Brustein |first1=William I. |url=https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139046848.003 |title=The Socialism of Fools? Leftist Origins of Modern Anti-Semitism |last2=Roberts |first2=Louisa |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2015 |publication-date=2015 |pages=24–82 |chapter=2 - France|doi=10.1017/CBO9781139046848.003 |isbn=978-1-139-04684-8 }}</ref> He criticized the government for being weak and "prostrate" when confronted with what he called a "secret and indissoluble league" of Jews. Post-Medieval antisemitic rhetoric often accused Jews of being unable to assimilate into a unitary national culture (highly valued by the French nationalists). Fourier was one of the writers to argue that Jews were disloyal and would not make good French citizens. Like others, he placed great significance on the religious restrictions prohibiting Jews from eating at the same table as non-Jews:<ref name="Brustein Roberts 2015 pp. 33-34">{{cite book |last1=Brustein |first1=William |author-link=William Brustein |last2=Roberts |first2=Louisa |title=The Scialism of Fools: Leftist Origins of Modern Anti-Semitism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |publication-place=New York |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-139-04684-8 |oclc=915136563 |pages=33–34}}</ref>

<blockquote>he confined himself to sitting down at table and drinking; he refused to eat any of the dishes, because they were prepared by Christians. Christians have to be very patient to tolerate such impertinence. In the Jewish religion it denotes a system of defiance and aversion for other sects. Now, does a sect which wishes to carry its hatred as far as the table of its protectors, deserve to be protected?</blockquote>

== Influence ==
{{Libertarian socialism sidebar|People }}
The influence of Fourier's ideas in French politics carried forward into the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|1848 Revolution]] and the [[Paris Commune]] by followers such as [[Victor Considerant]].

*Numerous references to Fourierism appear in [[Dostoevsky]]'s [[political fiction|political novel]] ''[[The Possessed (novel)|Demons]],'' published in 1872.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Postoutenko|first1=Kirill|title=The Influence of Anxiety: Figures of Absolute Evil in French Socialists and Dostoevsky| website= academia.edu| url= https://www.academia.edu/9262238| year= 2009| access-date=22 August 2016}}</ref>
*Fourier's ideas also took root in America, with his followers starting phalanxes throughout the country, including one of the most famous, [[Utopia, Ohio]].
*Fourier is one of three major utopian socialists whose ideas are critiqued in [[Friedrich Engels]]'s [[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]].
*[[Peter Kropotkin]], in the preface to his book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', considered Fourier the founder of the [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] branch of [[Socialism|socialist]] thought, as opposed to the authoritarian socialist ideas of [[François-Noël Babeuf|Babeuf]] and [[Philippe Buonarroti|Buonarroti]].<ref>{{cite book| first= Peter| last= Kropotkin| title= The Conquest of Bread| url= https://archive.org/details/conquestbread00kropgoog| place= New York and London| publisher= Putnam| year= 1906}}</ref>
*In the mid-20th century, Fourier's influence began to rise again among writers reappraising socialist ideas outside the [[Marxism|Marxist]] mainstream. After the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] broke with the [[French Communist Party]], [[André Breton]] returned to Fourier, writing ''Ode à Charles Fourier'' in 1947.
*[[Walter Benjamin]] considered Fourier crucial enough to devote an entire "[[konvolut]]" of his massive, projected book on the Paris arcades, the ''[[Arcades Project|Passagenwerk]]'', to Fourier's thought and influence. He writes: "To have instituted play as the canon of a labor no longer rooted in exploitation is one of the great merits of Fourier", and notes that "Only in the summery middle of the nineteenth century, only under its sun, can one conceive of Fourier's fantasy materialized."<ref name="Nguyen 2022 pp. 151–192">{{cite book |last=Nguyen |first=Duy Lap |title=Walter Benjamin and the Critique of Political Economy |chapter=Fourier or the Arcades: The Liberation of Work and Desire or an Eternity of the New |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |year=2022 |doi=10.5040/9781350180451.ch-6 |isbn=978-1-350-18042-0 |oclc=1289456629 |pages=151–192}}</ref>
*[[Herbert Marcuse]] in his influential work ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' wrote, "Fourier comes closer than any other utopian socialist to elucidating the dependence of freedom on non-repressive [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]."<ref name= Eros />{{rp|218}}
*In 1969, [[Raoul Vaneigem]] quoted and adapted Fourier's ''Avis aux civilisés relativement à la prochaine métamorphose sociale'' in his text ''Avis aux civilisés relativement à l'autogestion généralisée''.<ref>{{cite web| first= Charles| last= Fourier| url= http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.selfman.htm |title= Notice to the Civilized Concerning Generalized Self-Management}}</ref>
[[File:Phalanxary colt nj.jpg|thumb|200px|[[North American Phalanx]] building in New Jersey]]
*Fourier's work significantly influenced the writings of [[Gustav Wyneken]], [[Guy Davenport]] (in his work of fiction ''[[Apples and Pears (book)|Apples and Pears]]''), [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]], and [[Paul Goodman]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2022}}
*In [[Whit Stillman]]'s film ''[[Metropolitan (1990 film)|Metropolitan]]'', the idealistic Tom Townsend describes himself as a Fourierist, and debates the success of social experiment [[Brook Farm]] with another character. Bidding him goodnight, Sally Fowler says, "Good luck with your furrierism." {{sic}}
*[[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], in the appendix to his book ''Spaces of Hope'', offers a personal utopian vision of the future in cities citing Fourier's ideas.
*[[Libertarian socialist]] and environmentalist thinker [[Murray Bookchin]] wrote that "The Greek ideal of the rounded citizen in a rounded environment—one that reappeared in Charles Fourier’s utopian works—was long cherished by the anarchists and socialists of the last century...The opportunity of the individual to devote his or her productive activity to many different tasks over an attenuated work week (or in Fourier’s ideal society, over a given day) was seen as a vital factor in overcoming the division between manual and intellectual activity, in transcending status differences that this major division of work created, and in enhancing the wealth of experiences that came with a free movement from industry through crafts to food cultivation."<ref>{{cite web| url= http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-the-meaning-of-confederalism| author-link= Murray Bookchin| first= Murray | last= Bookchin| title= The Meaning of Confederalism| year= 1990}}</ref>
*[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] in Chapter 7 of his novel ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]'' gently mocks Fourier, writing: {{quote|"When, as a consequence of human improvement", said I, "the globe shall arrive at its final perfection, the great ocean is to be converted into a particular kind of lemonade, such as was fashionable at Paris in Fourier's time. He calls it limonade a cedre. It is positively a fact!

*Writers of the [[post-left anarchy]] tendency have praised Fourier's work. Bob Black in his work ''[[The Abolition of Work]]'' advocates Fourier's idea of attractive work as a solution to his criticisms of work conditions in contemporary society.<ref name="Black 2002">{{cite web |last=Black |first=Bob |title=The Abolition of Work |website=primitivism.com |date=2002-04-15 |url=http://primitivism.com/abolition.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126142422/http://primitivism.com/abolition.htm |archive-date=2010-11-26 |url-status=dead |quote= The secret of turning work into play, as Charles Fourier demonstrated, is to arrange useful activities to take advantage of whatever it is that various people at various times in fact enjoy doing.

Those other two apostles of freedom & desire had no political disciples, but in the middle of the 19th century literally hundreds of communes (phalansteries) were founded on fourierist principles".<ref name= Lemonade />
