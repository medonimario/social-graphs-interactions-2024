'''Charles Blount''' (27 April 1654 – August 1693) was an [[England|English]] [[deism|deist]] and [[philosopher]] who published several anonymous essays critical of the existing English order.

==Life==
Blount was born in [[Upper Holloway]],<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Blount, Charles}}</ref> Islington, Middlesex, the fourth son of Sir [[Henry Blount (knight)|Henry Blount]].  His father educated him at home and exposed him to freethinking philosophy.  In 1672 Charles inherited lands in Islington and the estate of Blount's Hall in [[Staffordshire]].  He married Eleanor Tyrrell in [[Westminster Abbey]] at the end of 1672; they had three sons and a daughter.  Throughout his life he remained at Blount's Hall as a leisured gentleman, although he also travelled to [[London]] to participate in courtly life.

Blount's publications were consistently anonymous or written under a pseudonym, and with a radical or [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] slant. In 1673 he wrote ''Mr Dreyden Vindicated'', defending [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' from [[Richard Leigh (poet)|Richard Leigh]]'s attacks.  In 1673 he also penned the anonymous ''The Friendly Vindication.''

In 1678 Blount became a member of the [[Green Ribbon Club]], a group of radical Whig advocates and activists. In 1679 he published ''An Appeal from the Country to the City'' under the name of "Junius Brutus".  It was a strongly Whig piece that suggested that the [[Popish Plot]] was entirely real.  It painted a lurid picture of what life in London would be like under [[James II of England|James II]] and [[Roman Catholicism]].  In this case, the printer was seized and fined, and the pamphlet was burned by the common hangman (i.e. a symbolic execution of the book for treason).  The same year, he assumed the name of Philopatris ("lover of his country") to write ''A Just Vindication of Learning,'' which was an argument against the [[Licensing Act 1662|act licensing printers]].  He mimicked [[John Milton]]'s previous ''[[Areopagitica]].''  After the death of [[Thomas Hobbes]] Blount produced an anonymous broadsheet of "sayings" from Hobbes' book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]].''<ref>''The last sayings, or, Dying legacy of Mr. Thomas Hobbs of Malmesbury who departed this life on Thursday, Decemb. 4, 1679'', London, 1680.</ref>

In 1693 Blount used his ironic approach to argue for the validity of [[William III of England|William and Mary]].  His ''King William and Queen Mary Conquerors'' argued that they were, in fact, conquerors of England, since they landed with force; therefore the people should support them as able protectors, as Hobbes had argued that the people should obey anyone who represented such force.  This pamphlet was licensed by the [[Tory]] licensor [[Edmund Bohun]].  In 1695 [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] debated the fate of the work and had it, too, burned by the common hangman; and Bohun lost his position.<ref>Dorothy Auchter, ''Dictionary of Literary and Dramatic Censorship in Tudor and Stuart England'' (2001), pp. 179–183</ref> The Act for the licensing of the press was allowed to expire, as well.<ref>The 1662 Licensing Act was not renewed when it expired in May 1695.</ref>

In 1689 Blount's wife had died, and he wanted to marry her sister, but such marriages were illegal at that time in England. He wrote to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1693 and requested permission, but was denied. In August 1693 he committed suicide.<ref name=EB1911/> [[Alexander Pope]] wrote in a footnote to his 'Epilogue to the Satires: Dialogue I' that Blount, 'being in love with a near kinswoman of his, and rejected, gave himself a stab in the arm, as pretending to kill himself, of the consequence of which he really died'.<ref>Footnote to line 123; Alexander Pope, 'Epilogue to the Satires Dialogue I', ''Alexander Pope: The Major Works'', ed. Pat Rogers (2008), p. 398.</ref>

==Works on religion and deism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2020}}
In 1679 Blount published, anonymously, ''Anima Mundi'', an essay that appeared to review pagan theories of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[afterlife]].  Throughout, Blount says that it is perfectly clear that the soul is immortal and that there is an afterlife, but his statements are made in a way that makes them absurd, and lengthy descriptions of other views are then juxtaposed with patently insincere claims that the [[Christian Church|Church]] must be correct. [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]], then [[bishop of London]], argued that the book should be suppressed, but while Compton was out of the city, enthusiastic opponents of the work had it publicly burned. The same year, Blount sent a copy of the work to [[Thomas Hobbes]], whose philosophy Blount admired, with a letter in praise of [[Arianism]], which was then published.

Blount's deist publications came in 1680, with ''Great Diana of the Ephesians'' and ''The Two First Books of Philostratus concerning the Life of Apollonius Tyaneus''. The two works appear to be translations and history. However, the notes in the work attacked [[Christianity]] directly. First, Blount suggested that rational religion was destroyed by the Church. Second, his decrying of pagan sacrifices was a coded attack on [[eucharist]]ic doctrine and Church practice. He attached extensive notes which mocked "priestcraft" and corrupt priests.

He followed this with a smaller work, ''Miracles, No Violations of the Laws of Nature'' (1683), which contained only quotations from [[Thomas Burnet (theologian)|Thomas Burnet]], Hobbes, and [[Baruch Spinoza]], combined to say that accounts of miracles are without any empirical basis.

He also wrote his own ''Religio laici'' (1683) to answer [[John Dryden]]'s ''Religio Laici'' (1682) and its attacks on deism.

In 1693, [[Charles Gildon]] edited and published ''The Oracles of Reason''.<ref>On the title page of his ''The Deist's Manual'', Gildon acknowledged that he was the publisher of ''The Oracles of Reason''. See: {{cite book |last1= Gildon |first1= Charles |title= The Deist's Manual: or, A Rational Enquiry into the Christian Religion |date= 1705 |publisher= A. Roper; Fran. Coggan; and Geo. Strahan |location= London }}</ref> This book is a collection of Deist writings supplied by Blount. It comprises a "Preface" by Gildon, Blount's "Vindication of Dr. Burnet", an English translation by "H. B." of three sections of [[Thomas Burnet (theologian)|Thomas Burnet]]'s ''Archaeologiae Philosophicae'', Blount's "Summary Account of the Deists Religion", and several letters (tracts) prepared by Blount, Gildon, and others.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Blount |first1= Charles |editor1-last= Gildon |editor1-first= Charles |title= The Oracles of Reason |date= 1693 |publisher= by the editor |location= London }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1= Burnet |first1= Thomas |title= Archaeologiae Philosophicae: sive Doctrina antiqua de rerum originibus |date= 1692 |publisher= Walter Kettilby |location= London |language= Latin}}</ref> These pieces express doubts about the [[Book of Genesis]], deny the possibility of [[revelation]], deny miracles, and suggest that there might be many worlds with life on them. In 1695, Gildon republished ''The Oracles of Reason'' in his collection of ''The Miscellaneous Works of Charles Blount''. As well as ''The Oracles of Reason'', this book contains ''Anima Mundi'', ''Diana of the Ephesians'', ''An Appeal from the Country to the City, for the Preservation of His Majesty's Person, Liberty, Property, and the Protestant Religion'', ''A Just Vindication of Learning, and the Liberty of the Press'', and "A Dialogue between K. W. and the late K. J. on the Banks of the Boyn, the Day before the Battel". Writing as "Lindamour", Gildon prefaced these works with an invented letter "To the Honorable and Divine Hermione. Giving an account of the Life and Death of the Author.", also known as Gildon's hagiographic "Life of Blount".<ref>{{cite book |last1= Blount |first1= Charles |editor1-last= Gildon |editor1-first= Charles |title= The Miscellaneous Works of Charles Blount, Esq; |date= 1695 |publisher= by the editor |location= London }}</ref><ref>See also Ernest Mossner's article on "Blount, Charles" at https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/blount-charles-1654-1693 and Leslie Stevens's article on "Blount, Charles (1654–1693)" in the second edition of the ''Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref>
