'''Alfred Sohn-Rethel''' (4 January 1899 – 6 April 1990) was a French-born German [[Marxian economist]] and [[philosopher]] especially interested in [[epistemology]]. His main intellectual achievement was the publication of ''Intellectual and Manual Labour: A Critique of Epistemology''. He also wrote about the relationship between German industry and [[Nazism|National Socialism]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] near Paris, Sohn-Rethel came from a family of painters, his father was painter, [[Alfred Sohn-Rethel (painter)|Alfred Sohn-Rethel]] (1875–1958) and his mother was Anna Julie, née Michels. His mother was a descendant from the noble [[Oppenheim family]] and had influential relations with big business. His paternal grandfather was painter, [[Karl Rudolf Sohn]] and his paternal grandmother was painter and singer, [[Else Sohn-Rethel]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Böttcher|first=Kirsten|date=2016-06-01|title=Else Sohn-Rethels Memoiren, Das Turbulente Leben einer Künstlergattin|trans-title=Else Sohn-Rethel's Memoirs, The Turbulent Life of an Artist's Wife|url=https://www.br.de/radio/bayern2/kultur/radiotexte/else-sohn-rethels-lebenserinnerungen-100.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818021213/https://www.br.de/radio/bayern2/kultur/radiotexte/else-sohn-rethels-lebenserinnerungen-100.html|archive-date=2016-08-18|access-date=2020-08-09|website=Radio Bayern 2, Kultur}}</ref> As his family did not want him also to become a painter, he was brought up by his uncle, the steel industrialist [[Ernst Poensgen]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Banaji|first=Jairus|title=Alfred Sohn-Rethel|url=http://www.historicalmaterialism.org/node/1183|access-date=2020-08-10|website=Historical Materialism}}</ref> On Christmas 1915, he expressed a wish for a copy of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'' as a present. He received one and studied it intensively. Thrown out of home, he participated in the anti-war student protest in his first year at [[Heidelberg University]] in 1917.<ref name="IML-Preface">Alfred Sohn-Rethel, 'Preface', ''Intellectual and Manual Labour''</ref>

From 1920 Sohn-Rethel was a friend of the philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]], and he met [[Walter Benjamin]] in 1921. He came to live in [[Positano]] in 1923–24, and ''Naples: philosophy of the broken'' recorded his fascination with the relaxed Neapolitan attitude to technology.<ref>[http://www.formundzweck.com/eng/themen.php?E+Reparatur+100+das_idea The Ideal of the Broken-Down: On the Neapolitan Approach to Things Technical]</ref> Between 1924 and 1927 he remained in Italy, "mainly in [[Capri]], where Benjamin and Bloch were staying",<ref name=IML-Preface/> meeting [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Siegfried Kracauer|Kracauer]] also at Capri in 1924. Additionally his paternal uncle, [[Otto Sohn-Rethel]] lived in [[Anacapri]] a city in Capri, whom he visited with.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Orme|first=Robert|date=Summer 2007|title=A Rediscovered Gay Artist|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/574336ff8a65e2f89075de40/t/574e101e4c2f850c8f5f20a7/1464733728310/llgaf_summer2007.pdf|journal=The Journal of Leslie/Lohman Gay Art Foundation|number=24|pages=20–21}}</ref> He stayed in contact with different members of the [[Frankfurt School]], to whom his theoretical concerns were close; however, they never established a close working relationship.

Sohn-Rethel received his doctorate with the Austrian economist [[Emil Lederer]] in 1928.<ref>''Von der Analytik des Wirtschaftcns zur Theorie der Volkswirtschaft: Methodologische Untersuchung mit besonderem Bezug auf die Theorie Schumpeters'', 1928. Published 1936.</ref> In his thesis he criticized the theory of [[marginal utility]] as a [[petitio principii]] because it implies the notion of number implicitly. 
Thanks to Poensgen he found a job as research assistant at the Mitteleuropäischer Wirtschaftstag (MWT). The MWT was a lobbying organization of the leading export industries. From 1931 to 1936 he worked 'in the cave of the lion' and watched and analyzed power politics from a very close distance. At the same time he had contacts with socialist resistance groups like ''Neu beginnen'' or ''Der rote Stosstrupp''. In 1937 he emigrated via [[Switzerland]] and [[Paris]] to [[England]]. He wrote economic analyses for a circle close to [[Winston Churchill]] which were used against [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s appeasement policy.

For a long time after the Second World War Sohn-Rethel was not really able to continue his theoretical work. He made a living teaching French. He joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] and despite his disillusionment he was a member until 1972. The [[May 1968|1968 movement]] created a new interest in his work. At the funeral of Adorno he met the editor Siegfried Unseld who encouraged him to crystallize his ideas in his major work ''Intellectual and manual labor''. In 1978 Sohn-Rethel was appointed Professor for Social Philosophy at [[University of Bremen|Bremen University]].  He died in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] in 1990.

==Work==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2021}}
Sohn-Rethel's lifelong project was the critique of Kantian epistemology through Marx's critique of political economy. Even though individuals exchange commodities in order to gain access to their use-value, the act of exchange is possible only through the abstraction from the use-value that permits to draw an equivalence of value between disparate sensible objects. Only the value of these goods is important. This abstraction is called 'real abstraction' because it is not operated by the consciousness of the property owners, but is nevertheless necessarily presupposed by the real act of exchange. Sohn-Rethel believed this abstraction to be the real basis of formal and abstract thinking. All of Kant's categories such as space, time, quality, substance, accident, movement and so forth are present in the act of exchange. Readers of Marx will not be entirely surprised by such a genealogy, since Marx himself suggested that the ideas of freedom and equality, at least as we know them so far, are rooted in the exchange of commodities. Sohn-Rethel's work on the nature of 'real abstraction' has been amplified and extended by the writers of [[Arena (Australian publishing co-operative)]], especially the notion that a [[Post-Marxism|post-Marxist]] social and historical analysis can be founded on the 'real abstraction' principle.  An example of using Sohn-Rethel's idea of commodity occurs in Slavoj Zizek's work ''[[The Sublime Object of Ideology]]''.

The second domain where Sohn-Rethel made important contributions was the study of the economic policies that favoured the rise of German fascism, much of which is based on first-hand knowledge gained from his time at the MWT. He insisted on the difference between different factions of capitalists, the more prospering industries close to [[Heinrich Brüning|Brüning]] and the less successful industries close to the [[Harzburger Front]] (Hugenberg, Hitler) namely coal, construction and steel - with the exception of [[Krupp]]. The endorsement of the compromise between industry and big agrarians  at the shareholders' meeting of the [[IG Farben]] in 1932 paved the way for the dictatorship, according to Sohn-Rethel.
