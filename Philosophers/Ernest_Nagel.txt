'''Ernest Nagel''' (November 16, 1901 – September 20, 1985) was an American [[philosopher of science]].<ref name=":0">[[Patrick Suppes|Suppes, Patrick]] (1999).

His 1961 book ''[[The Structure of Science]]'' is considered a foundational work in the logic of [[scientific explanation]].

==Life and career==
Nagel was born in [[Nové Mesto nad Váhom]] (now in [[Slovakia]], then [[Vágújhely]] and part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]) to Jewish parents.<ref name=":0" /> His mother, Frida Weiss, was from the nearby town of [[Vrbové]] (or Verbo).<ref>Nagel, Y. (2022). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rElEEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA29 "Ernest Nagel: A Biography."] In: Neuber, M., Tuboly, A.T. (eds) [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-81010-8#toc ''Ernest Nagel: Philosophy of Science and the Fight for Clarity''. ''Logic'']'', Epistemology, and the Unity of Science'', vol 53. Springer, Cham.</ref>

He emigrated to the United States at the age of 10 and became a U.S. citizen in 1919. He received a BSc from the [[City College of New York]] in 1923, and earned his PhD from [[Columbia University]] in 1931,<ref name="MathGenealogy-1931">{{MathGenealogy|id=49987}}</ref> with a dissertation on the concept of measurement.

Through the award of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggeheim Fellowship]] he was able to spend a year in Europe (from August 1934 to July 1935) to learn about the new trends in philosophy on the continent.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Neuber |first1=Matthias |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rElEEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA53 |title=Ernest Nagel: Philosophy of Science and the Fight for Clarity |last2=Tuboly |first2=Adam Tamas |date=2021-09-21 |publisher=Springer Nature |isbn=978-3-030-81010-8 |pages=53–56 |language=en}}</ref>

Except for one year (1966-1967) at [[Rockefeller University]], Nagel spent his entire academic career at Columbia. He became the first John Dewey Professor of Philosophy there in 1955.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs19551209-01.2.4|title=Columbia Daily Spectator 9 December 1955 — Columbia Spectator|website=spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> And then University Professor from 1967 until his retirement in 1970, after which he continued to teach. In 1977, he was one of the few philosophers elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].

His work concerned the philosophy of mathematical fields such as [[geometry]] and [[probability]], [[quantum mechanics]], and the status of [[Reductionism#In science|reductive]] and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] [[Philosophy of science|theories of science]]. His book ''[[The Structure of Science]]'' (1961) practically inaugurated the field of [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] [[philosophy of science]]. He expounded the different kinds of explanation in different fields, and was sceptical about attempts to unify the nature of scientific laws or explanations. He was the first to propose that by positing analytic equivalencies (or "bridge laws") between the terms of different sciences, one could eliminate all [[ontological commitment]]s except those required by the most basic science. He also upheld the view that [[social sciences]] are scientific, and should adopt the same standards as [[natural sciences]].

Nagel wrote ''An Introduction to Logic and the Scientific Method'' with [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], his CCNY teacher<ref name="MathGenealogy-1931"/> in 1934. In 1958, he published with [[James R. Newman]] ''Gödel's proof'', a short book explicating [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] to those not well trained in [[mathematical logic]]. He edited the ''[[Journal of Philosophy]]'' (1939–1956) and the ''[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]'' (1940-1946).

As a public intellectual, he supported a skeptical approach to claims of the [[paranormal]], becoming one of the first sponsors and fellows of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] in 1976, along with 24 other notable philosophers like [[W. V. Quine]]. The committee posthumously inducted him into their "Pantheon of Skeptics" in recognition of Nagel's contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pantheon of Skeptics|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|website=CSI|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|access-date=30 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131054129/http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|archive-date=31 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Kurtz |first1=Paul |title=Skeptical Inquirer: W.V.

Nagel was an elected member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] (1962)<ref>{{Cite web |title=APS Member History |url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Ernest+Nagel&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced |access-date=2022-11-18 |website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref> and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1981).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ernest Nagel |url=https://www.amacad.org/person/ernest-nagel |access-date=2022-11-18 |website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences |language=en}}</ref>

He died in [[New York City|New York]]. He had two sons, [[Alexander Nagel]] (professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin) and [[Sidney Nagel]] (professor of physics at the University of Chicago).

Nagel's doctoral students include [[Morton White]], [[Patrick Suppes]], [[Henry Kyburg]], [[Isaac Levi]], and [[Kenneth Schaffner]].
