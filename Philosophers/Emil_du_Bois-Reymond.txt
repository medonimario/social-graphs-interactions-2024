'''Emil Heinrich du Bois-Reymond''' (7 November 1818 – 26 December 1896) was a German [[physiologist]], the co-discoverer of [[nerve]] [[action potential]], and the developer of experimental [[electrophysiology]]. His lectures on science and culture earned him great esteem during the latter half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |last1= |first1=|title=The Greatest Unknown Intellectual of the 19th Century |date=7 November 2019|url=https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-greatest-unknown-intellectual-of-the-19th-century/ |publisher=MIT Press |access-date=10 September 2023}}</ref>

==Life==
Du Bois-Reymond was born in [[Berlin]] and spent his life there. His younger brother was the mathematician [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]] (1831–1889). His father was a poor immigrant from [[Neuchâtel]], and his mother was a Berliner of prominent [[Huguenot]] origin.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=625}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Finkelstein |first=Gabriel |title=Emil du Bois-Reymond: neuroscience, self, and society in nineteenth-century Germany |publisher=The MIT Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4619-5032-5 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts; London, England |pages=230 |oclc=864592470}}</ref>

Educated first at the [[Französisches Gymnasium Berlin|French College]] in Berlin, du Bois-Reymond enrolled in the [[Humboldt University|University of Berlin]] in 1838. He seems to have been uncertain at first as to the topic of his studies, for he was a student of the renowned [[ecclesiastical]] [[historian]] [[Johann August Wilhelm Neander|August Neander]], and dallied with [[Naturphilosophie]], [[geology]], and physics, but eventually began to study [[medicine]] with such zeal and success as to attract the notice of [[Johannes Peter Müller]] (1801–1858), a well-known professor of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=625}}

Müller's earlier studies had been distinctly physiological, but his preferences caused him later to study comparative anatomy. He had, about the time when the young du Bois-Reymond came to his lectures, published his ''Elements of Physiology'', which contains the following statement:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=626}}
<blockquote>
Though there appears to be something in the phenomena of living beings which cannot be explained by ordinary mechanical, physical or chemical laws, much may be so explained, and we may without fear push these explanations as far as we can, so long as we keep to the solid ground of observation and experiment.
</blockquote>
In 1840 Müller made du Bois-Reymond his assistant in physiology, and as the beginning of an inquiry gave him a copy of the essay which the Italian physicist [[Carlo Matteucci]] had just published on the [[bioelectricity|electric phenomena of animals]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Edwin|title=Nineteenth-century origins of neuroscientific concepts|last2=Jacyna|first2=L.

He chose as the subject of his graduation thesis ''[[Electric fish]]es,'' and so commenced a long series of investigations on bioelectricity. The results of these inquiries were made known partly in papers communicated to scientific journals, but also and chiefly by his work ''Investigations of Animal Electricity'',<ref name="Rothsc-EC">{{cite web |last1=Rothschuh |first1=K.

In 1852 while living alone and unable to get a professorship he traveled to England and met his second cousin Jeannette Claude, whom he courted and married in 1853.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Finkelstein |first=Gabriel |title=Emil du Bois-Reymond: neuroscience, self, and society in nineteenth-century Germany. |publisher=The MIT Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-262-01950-7 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts; London, England |pages=117–170}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDBcEAAAQBAJ |title=Unraveling the Seven Riddles of the Universe|date=2022|publisher=Hamilton Books|isbn=9780761872900 }}</ref> The couple had ten children, one of whom died in infancy.

Concerning his religious opinions, du Bois-Reymond was an atheist or at best agnostic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Meulders|first=Michel|title=Helmholtz: From Enlightenment to Neuroscience|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2010|isbn=9780262014489|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts; London, England|page=74|translator-last=Garey|translator-first=Laurence|chapter=5: Helmholtz and the Understanding of Nature|quote=Du Bois-Reymond was a self-proclaimed atheist but more through intimate conviction than logical necessity.}}</ref>

''Investigations of Animal Electricity'' may be seen in two ways. On the one hand, it is a record of the exact determination and approximative analysis of the electric phenomena presented by living beings. Viewed from this standpoint, it represents a significant advance in biological knowledge. Du Bois-Reymond built up this branch of science, by inventing or improving methods, by devising new instruments of observation, or by adapting old ones. On the other hand, the volumes in question contain an exposition of a theory of bioelectricity. In them Du Bois-Reymond put forward a general conception that a living tissue, such as [[muscle]], might be regarded as composed of a number of electric molecules, and that the electric behavior of the muscle was the product of these elementary units.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=626}} We now know that these are [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and other [[ion]]s, the gradients of which are responsible for maintaining [[membrane potentials]] in excitable cells.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

His theory was soon criticized by several contemporary physiologists, such as [[Ludimar Hermann]], who maintained that intact living tissue such as [[muscle]] does not generate electric currents unless it has suffered injury.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel|date=1 May 2006|title=Emil du Bois-Reymond vs Ludimar Hermann|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631069106000400|journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies|series=Aspects de l'histoire des neurosciences|language=en|volume=329|issue=5|pages=340–347|doi=10.1016/j.crvi.2006.03.005|pmid=16731491|issn=1631-0691}}</ref> The subsequent controversy was ultimately resolved in 1902 by du Bois-Reymond's student [[Julius Bernstein]], who incorporated parts of both theories into an ionic model of action potential.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seyfarth|first=Ernst-August|date=January 2006|title=Julius Bernstein (1839–1917): pioneer neurobiologist and biophysicist|journal=Biological Cybernetics|language=en|volume=94|issue=1|pages=2–8|doi=10.1007/s00422-005-0031-y|pmid=16341542|s2cid=2842501|issn=0340-1200}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=De Palma|first1=Armando|last2=Pareti|first2=Germana|date=October 2011|title=Bernstein's Long Path to Membrane Theory: Radical Change and Conservation in Nineteenth-Century German Electrophysiology|journal=Journal of the History of the Neurosciences|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=306–337|doi=10.1080/0964704X.2010.532024|pmid=22003859|s2cid=12982742|issn=0964-704X}}</ref> Thus, du Bois-Reymond's work focused on animal electricity, although he made other physiological inquiries — such as could be studied by physical methods — concerning the phenomena of [[diffusion]], the muscular production of lactic acid, and the development of shocks by electric fishes.

Du Bois-Reymond exerted great influence as a teacher.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel|title=Emil du Bois-Reymond: neuroscience, self, and society in nineteenth-century Germany|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4619-5032-5|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts; London, England|pages=174–179|oclc=864592470}}</ref> In 1858, upon the death of Johannes Müller, the professorship of anatomy and physiology at the University of Berlin was divided into a professorship of human and [[comparative anatomy]], which was given to [[Karl Bogislaus Reichert]] (1811–1883), and a professorship of physiology, which was given to du Bois-Reymond. This he held until his death, performing research for many years without adequate accommodation. In 1877, the Prussian government granted his wish and provided the university with a modern physiological laboratory.

In 1851 du Bois-Reymond was admitted to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of Berlin]], and in 1876 he became its perpetual secretary.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=626}} Like his friend [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], who had also studied under [[Johannes Peter Müller]], du Bois-Reymond was known throughout Germany. He used his influence for the advancement of science, introducing the theories of thermodynamics and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] to students at the University of Berlin.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=626}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel|date=May 2019|title=Haeckel and du Bois-Reymond: rival German Darwinists|journal=Theory in Biosciences|language=en|volume=138|issue=1|pages=105–112|doi=10.1007/s12064-019-00282-6|issn=1431-7613|pmid=30868434|s2cid=76663563}}</ref> He owed the largest part of his fame, however, to occasional discourses on literature, history, and [[philosophy]].

==Oratory==
===On nationalism===
Following [[Franco-Prussian War|France's declaration of war on Prussia]] on 3 August 1870, du Bois-Reymond proclaimed that "the University of Berlin, quartered opposite the [[Berlin Palace|King's palace]], is, by the deed of its foundation, the intellectual bodyguard (geistige Leibregiment) of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]."<ref name="fah">{{cite web|last1=du Bois-Reymond|first1=Emil|title=Über den Deutschen Krieg.

=== On history ===
In 1877 du Bois-Reymond presented a view of the past that highlighted science as the sole endeavor that demonstrated any improvement. "Science is the chief instrument of civilization," he wrote, "and the history of science the essential history of humanity.”<ref>Emil du Bois-Reymond, "Kulturgeschichte und Naturwissenschaft. Im Verein für wissenschaftliche Vorlesungen zu Köln am 24. März 1877 gehaltener Vortrag," in Reden, 2 vols. (Leipzig: Veit, 1912), 1: 567–629, on 596.</ref> In 1936 his argument was repeated by [[George Sarton]] in a lecture inaugurating a seminary in the history of science at Harvard University:<blockquote>''Definition''. Science is systematized positive knowledge, or what has been taken as such at different ages and in different places.

''Theorem''. The acquisition and systematization of positive knowledge are the only human activities which are truly cumulative and progressive.

''Corollary''. The history of science is the only history which can illustrate the progress of mankind. In fact, progress has no definite and unquestionable meaning in other fields than the field of science.<ref>George Sarton, ''The Study of the History of Science'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1936), 5.</ref></blockquote>One historiographer described du Bois-Reymond's attention to the history of science as "the first and indeed the most decisive attack on established historical scholarship" in the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fuchs |first=Eckhardt |title=Henry Thomas Buckle.

=== On Darwinism ===
Du Bois-Reymond was the first German professor to convert to Darwinism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel|date=May 2019|title=Haeckel and du Bois-Reymond: rival German Darwinists|url=https://hcommons.org/deposits/download/hc:23806/CONTENT/rival-german-darwinists.pdf/|journal=Theory in Biosciences|language=en|volume=138|issue=1|pages=105–112|doi=10.1007/s12064-019-00282-6|issn=1431-7613|pmid=30868434|s2cid=76663563 }}</ref> He expounded the theory in popular classes at the University of Berlin, in itinerant lectures in the [[Ruhr]] and the [[Rhineland]], and in formal addresses translated and reprinted across Europe and North America. Unlike his rival [[Ernst Haeckel]], du Bois-Reymond espoused a mechanistic interpretation of natural selection that anticipated modern views.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=du Bois-Reymond|first=Emil|date=February 1879|title=Darwin vs. Galiani|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_14/February_1879/Darwin_vs_Galiani|journal=Popular Science Monthly|volume=14|pages=409–425|via=Wikisource}}</ref> Few in Germany took offense at his teachings until 1883, when his obituary to Darwin outraged conservatives and Catholics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=du Bois-Reymond|first=Emil|date=1883-04-01|title=Darwin and Copernicus|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=27|issue=702|pages=557–558|doi=10.1038/027557a0|bibcode=1883Natur..27..557. |issn=1476-4687|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===On epistemology===
In 1880 du Bois-Reymond delivered a speech to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] enumerating seven "[[world riddle]]s" or "shortcomings" of science:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel|title=Emil du Bois-Reymond: neuroscience, self, and society in nineteenth-century Germany|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4619-5032-5|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts; London, England|pages=272–273|oclc=864592470}}</ref>

# the ultimate nature of [[matter]] and force;
# the origin of motion;
# the [[origin of life]];
# the "apparently [[teleological]] arrangements of nature" (not an "absolutely transcendent riddle");
# the [[Hard problem of consciousness|origin of simple sensations]] ("a quite transcendent" question);
# the [[Mind–body problem|origin of intelligent thought and language]] (which might be known if the origin of sensations could be known); and
# the question of [[free will]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=William E. |last=Leverette Jr.|title=E. L. Youmans' Crusade for Scientific Autonomy and Respectability|journal= American Quarterly|volume=17|issue=1|year=1965|pages=21|doi=10.2307/2711334 |jstor=2711334 }}</ref>
Concerning numbers 1, 2 and 5 he proclaimed "[[ignoramus et ignorabimus|Ignorabimus]]" ("we will never know"). Concerning number 7 he proclaimed "Dubitemus" ("we doubt it').
