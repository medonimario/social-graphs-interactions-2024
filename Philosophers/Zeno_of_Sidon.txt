'''Zeno of Sidon''' ({{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Ζήνων|Ζήνων]] ὁ Σιδώνιος}}; c. 150 – c. 75 BC{{sfn|Dorandi|1999|p=52}}) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Epicureanism|Epicurean philosopher]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zeno of Sidon {{!}} Greek philosopher|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Zeno-of-Sidon|access-date=2021-09-15|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|language=en}}</ref> from the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] city of [[Sidon]]. His writings have not survived, but there are some epitomes of his lectures preserved among the writings of his pupil [[Philodemus]].

==Life==
Zeno was born in the city of [[Sidon]]. He was a contemporary of [[Cicero]], who heard him when at [[Athens]].<ref name="cicero1">Cicero, ''[[de Natura Deorum]]'', i. 59 .</ref><ref name="cicero2">Cicero, ''Tusculan Disputations'', iii. 17.</ref>

He was sometimes termed the "leading Epicurean." ({{langx|la|Coryphaeus Epicureorum}})<ref name="cicero1"/> [[Cicero]] states that Zeno was contemptuous of other philosophers, and even called [[Socrates]] "the [[Attica|Attic]] Buffoon (''scurram Atticum'')."<ref>Cicero, ''de Natura Deorum'', i. 93.</ref>  He was a disciple of [[Apollodorus the Epicurean|Apollodorus]],<ref name="diogx26">{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925b|loc=§ 26}}</ref> and Cicero and [[Diogenes Laërtius]] both  describe him as an accurate and polished thinker.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Zeno of Sidon|volume=28|page=972}}</ref><ref name="cicero1"/><ref name="diogvii35">{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 35}}</ref>

==Philosophy==
Zeno held that happiness is not merely dependent upon present enjoyment and prosperity, but also on a reasonable expectation of their continuance and appreciation.<ref name="EB1911"/><ref name="cicero2"/>

Zeno's writings have not survived, but among the charred [[papyrus]] remains at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], there is an ''Epitome of Conduct and Character from the Lectures of Zeno'' written by his pupil [[Philodemus]]. It contains the essays ''On Frank Criticism''<ref>PHerc. 1471</ref> and ''On Anger''.<ref>PHerc. 182</ref>

Zeno also studied the philosophy of [[mathematics]] based on the derivation of all knowledge from experience.  He criticized [[Euclid]], seeking to show that deductions from the fundamental principles ({{langx|grc-x-koine|ἀρχαί}}) of geometry cannot, on their own, be proved:
{{blockquote|[Some] admit the principles but deny that the propositions coming after the principles can be demonstrated unless they grant something that is not contained in the principles.  This method of controversy was followed by Zeno of Sidon, who belonged to the school of [[Epicurus]], and against whom [[Posidonius]] has written a whole book.<ref>[[Proclus]], ''ad I. Euclid.'' iii.</ref>}}
