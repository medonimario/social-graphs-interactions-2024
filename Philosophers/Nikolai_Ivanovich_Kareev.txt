==Life==

Like many other intellectuals in Russia, Kareev was deeply influenced by the liberal, progressive, constitutional, and Socialist movements developing in Russia in the late nineteenth century.  [[Peter Kropotkin]], the Russian Anarchist, describes him as one of the few who correctly understood the [[French Revolution]], because he had studied "movements preceding the revolution of July 14".<ref>{{cite web
