'''Friedrich Jodl''' (23 August 1849 – 26 January 1914) was a German philosopher and psychologist. 

== Biography ==
Friedrich Jodl grew up in a Munich family association which, due to its proximity to the royal court, had provided numerous senior civil servants in Bavaria. The painter [[Heinrich Bürkel]], a family friend, introduced him to the fine arts at an early age.

Jodl began studying history and art history in Munich in 1867, but above all philosophy. His academic teachers included the philosophers [[Karl von Prantl]], [[Johann Nepomuk Huber|Johann Huber]] and [[Moriz Carrière]]. He received his PhD in 1872 with a thesis on [[David Hume]].<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=Jodl, Friedrich |url=https://austria-forum.org/af/AEIOU/Jodl%2C_Friedrich |access-date=2023-05-15 |website=Austria-Forum |language=de}}</ref> Jodl was then a lecturer at the Bavarian War Academy in Munich. After qualifying as a professor in philosophy, he accepted a professorship at the German University in Prague in 1885. In 1896 he took over a chair in philosophy at the [[University of Vienna]] and also taught aesthetics at the [[TU Wien|Technical University of Vienna]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Biographie |first=Deutsche |title=Jodl, Friedrich - Deutsche Biographie |url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd119305429.html#ndbcontent |access-date=2023-05-15 |website=www.deutsche-biographie.de |language=de}}</ref> He was also a member of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]]. 
In addition to his academic work, Jodl worked as head of the Viennese People's Education Association and as a sought-after speaker for the popularization and dissemination of scientific knowledge. As a representative of a [[positivism]] following [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], he was against [[ultramontanism]], which was very influential in Austria at the time, and campaigned for the freedom of science and against the influence of denominations, in Austria especially the Roman Catholic Church, in the public school system. He was a co-founder of the free-religious "German Society for Ethical Culture" and promoted e.g., for a state compulsory school in which non-denominational morals instruction is given instead of religious instruction.<ref name=":0" />

Friedrich Jodl had been married to the women's rights activist [[Margarethe Jodl|Margarete]] (née Förster) from 1882 and had no children.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Friedrich Jodl |url=https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at/Friedrich_Jodl |access-date=2023-05-15 |website=www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at}}</ref> he was an uncle of senior Nazi general [[Alfred Jodl]].

Jodl died from a long illness in 1914. At the time of "[[Red Vienna]]", Jodlgasse in Hietzing in 1919 and the Professor-Jodl-Hof residential complex in Döbling in 1926 were named after him in recognition of his services to popular education. Jodl's activities contributed significantly to the intellectual climate in Vienna in the early 20th century, from which the [[Logical positivism|Neopositivism]] of the [[Vienna Circle]] and thinkers related to it were heavily influenced.<ref>{{Citation |last=Belke |first=Ingrid |title=Friedrich Jodl (1849–1914) – ein Vorausgänger des Wiener Kreises |date=2022 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-84887-3_3 |work=Logischer Empirismus, Lebensreform und die deutsche Jugendbewegung: Logical Empiricism, Life Reform, and the German Youth Movement |pages=41–53 |editor-last=Damböck |editor-first=Christian |access-date=2023-05-16 |series=Veröffentlichungen des Instituts Wiener Kreis |place=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |language=de |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-84887-3_3 |isbn=978-3-030-84887-3 |editor2-last=Sandner |editor2-first=Günther |editor3-last=Werner |editor3-first=Meike G.|doi-access=free }}</ref>

A portrait bust by the Viennese sculptor Hans Mauer was placed in honor of Friedrich Jodl in the main courtyard of the University of Vienna.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Robert Schurz |first=Bayerischer Rundfunk |date=2012-02-10 |title=Der Volksaufklärer Friedrich Jodl: "In Bayern ist kein Platz mehr für mich ..." |url=https://www.br.de/radio/bayern2/sendungen/land-und-leute/volksaufklaerer-friedrich-lodl-schurz106.html |language=de}}</ref>
