==Research==
Greaves' current work is on issues related to [[effective altruism]], particularly in connection to [[Effective altruism#Cause prioritization|global prioritisation]]. Her research interests include [[moral philosophy]] (including foundational issues in [[consequentialism]], [[utilitarianism#Aggregating utility|interpersonal aggregation]], [[population ethics]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/british-academy-announces-rising-star-engagement-winners/2019375.article |title=British Academy announces Rising Star Engagement winners |website=[[Times Higher Education]] |first=Matthew |last=Riesz |date=2015-03-28 |access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> and moral uncertainty), [[formal epistemology]], and the [[philosophy of physics]],<ref>{{cite web | title = Hilary Greaves' home page | url = http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mert2255/ | access-date = 2019-09-10}}</ref> particularly [[quantum mechanics]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3886/1/Everett-at-50.pdf |first=Huw |last=Price |author-link=Huw Price |title=Decisions, Decisions, Decisions: Can Savage Salvage Everettian Probability? |encyclopedia=Many Worlds?

In October 2022, she was featured in [[Vox Media|Vox's]] ''Future Perfect 50'' for her work on [[longtermism]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Matthews |first=Dylan |date=2022-10-20 |title=Hilary Greaves is the world’s leading philosopher of the long-term future |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23357140/future-perfect-50-hilary-greaves-professor-philosophy-oxford |access-date=2023-04-26 |website=Vox |language=en}}</ref> She has argued that, just as [[Drowning child analogy|geographical distance]] should make no difference to how important it is to alleviate a person's suffering (to the extent that one is able to), temporal distance is likewise morally irrelevant. Greaves has defended her longtermist position in terms of both [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] outcomes and [[Intergenerational equity|intergenerational justice]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Samuel |first=Sigal |date=2021-07-02 |title=What we owe to future generations |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22552963/how-to-be-a-good-ancestor-longtermism-climate-change |access-date=2023-11-17 |website=Vox |language=en}}</ref>
