'''Simone Adolphine Weil''' ({{IPAc-en|'|v|eɪ}} {{respell|VAY}};<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dictionary.com {{!}} Meanings & Definitions of English Words |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/weil |access-date=13 December 2023 |website=Dictionary.com |language=en}}</ref> {{IPA|fr|simɔn adɔlfin vɛj|lang}}; 3 February 1909 – 24 August 1943) was a French [[philosopher]], [[Mysticism|mystic]], and [[political activist]]. Since 1995, more than 5,000 scholarly works have been published about her, including close analyses and readings of her work.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://simoneweil.library.ucalgary.ca/ |access-date=2024-09-20 |website=Simone Weil Bibliography |language=en-US}}</ref>

After her graduation from formal education, Weil became a teacher. She taught intermittently throughout the 1930s, taking several breaks because of poor health and in order to devote herself to [[political activism]]. Such work saw her assisting in the [[trade union]] movement, taking the side of the [[Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War|anarchists]] known as the [[Durruti Column]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and spending more than a year working as a labourer, mostly in car factories, so that she could better understand the [[working class]].

Weil became increasingly religious and inclined towards [[mysticism]] as her life progressed.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Sheldrake|first=Philip|title=A Brief History of Spirituality|publisher=Blackwell|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4051-1770-8|location=Oxford|pages=180–182}}</ref> She wrote throughout her life, although most of her writings did not attract much attention until after her death. In the 1950s and '60s, her work became famous in [[continental Europe]] and throughout the [[English-speaking world]]. Her thought has continued to be the subject of extensive scholarship across a wide range of fields.<ref>Especially philosophy and theology—also political and social science, feminism, science, education, and classical studies.</ref>

The mathematician [[André Weil]] was her brother.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Weil}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{MacTutor Biography|id=Weil_family|class=HistTopics|title=Weil family}}</ref>

==Early life==
[[File:Simone Weil 14.jpg|thumb|150px| Weil with her father]]

[[File:Simone Weil 1922.jpg|thumb|upright|Weil at age 13. The photograph was taken during a family holiday to Belgium, where she was laughing with her brother [[André Weil|André]].]]

Weil was born in her parents' apartment in [[Paris]] on 3 February 1909, the daughter of Bernard Weil (1872–1955), a medical doctor from an [[agnostic]] [[History of the Jews in Alsace|Alsatian Jewish]] background, who moved to Paris after the [[Franco-Prussian War|German]] annexation of [[Alsace–Lorraine]], and  Salomea "Selma" Reinherz (1879–1965), who was born into a Jewish family in [[Rostov-on-Don]] and raised in [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbNwXrQPs7kC|title = Simone Weil: Portrait of a Self-exiled Jew|isbn = 0-8078-1999-9|last1 = Nevin|first1 = Thomas R.|year = 1991| publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press }}</ref> According to [[Osmo Pekonen]], "the family name Weil came to be when many [[Levi (surname)|Levi]]s in the Napoleonic era changed their names this way, by anagram."<ref name=":2">Pekonen, O.

Her brother was mathematician [[André Weil]] (1906–1998), with whom she would always enjoy a close relationship.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|date=2 August 2019|title=The Weil Conjectures by Karen Olsson review – maths and mysticism|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/02/weil-conjectures-maths-pursuit-of-unknown-karen-olsson-review|access-date=11 March 2021|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

Weil was distressed by her father having to leave home for several years after being drafted to serve in the [[First World War]]. [[Eva Fogelman]], [[Robert Coles (psychiatrist)|Robert Coles]] and several other scholars believe that this experience may have contributed to the exceptionally strong [[altruism]] which Weil displayed throughout her life.<ref name=":5">According to Fogelman, Cole and others, various studies have found that a common formative experience for marked altruists is to suffer a hurtful loss and then to receive strong support from loving carers.</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/153791/friday-film-simone-weil-s-mission-of-empathy/|title= Friday Film: Simone Weil's Mission of Empathy|newspaper=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]] |author= [[Eva Fogelman]]|date= 23 March 2012|access-date= 6 September 2012|archive-date= 9 July 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130709081920/http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/153791/friday-film-simone-weil-s-mission-of-empathy/}}</ref><ref name="Coles">{{cite book|author=[[Robert Coles (psychiatrist)|Robert Coles]] |title= Simone Weil: A Modern Pilgrimage (Skylight Lives)|year=2001|isbn=1-893361-34-9|publisher = SkyLight Paths}}</ref> For example, a young Weil sent her share of sugar and chocolate to soldiers fighting at the front.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |title=The subversive Simone Weil: a life in five ideas |date=2021 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |location=Chicago |pages=4–7}}</ref> When Weil was 10 she joined striking workers chanting [[The Internationale|L'Internationale]] marching on the street below her apartment.<ref name=":7" /> When visiting a resort with her family and learning of the wages of the workers she encouraged the workers to unionize.<ref name=":7" />

From her childhood home, Weil acquired an obsession with cleanliness; in her later life she would sometimes speak of her "disgustingness" and think that others would see her this way, even though in her youth she had been considered highly attractive.<ref name=":6">According to Pétrement (1988), p. 14, family friends would refer to Simone and André as "the genius and the beauty".</ref> Weil was generally highly affectionate, but she almost always avoided any form of physical contact, even with female friends.<ref>Simone Pétrement (1988); pp. 4–7, 194</ref>

Weil's mother stated that her daughter much preferred boys to girls, and that she always did her best to teach her daughter what she believed were masculine virtues.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bourgault |first=Sophie |date=2014 |title=Beyond the Saint and the Red Virgin: Simone Weil as Feminist Theorist of Care |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/fro.2014.a552623 |journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=1–27 |doi=10.1353/fro.2014.a552623 |issn=1536-0334}}</ref> According to her friend and biographer, Simone Pétrement, Weil decided early in life that she would need to adopt masculine qualities and sacrifice opportunities for love affairs in order to fully pursue her vocation to improve social conditions for the disadvantaged. From her late teenage years, Weil would generally disguise her "fragile beauty" by adopting a masculine appearance, hardly ever using makeup and often wearing men's clothes.<ref name="Hellman">{{cite book|author=John Hellman|title=Simone Weil: An Introduction to Her Thought|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-88920-121-8|pages=1–23}}</ref><ref>Simone Pétrement (1988); pp. 27–29</ref> Both Weil's parents referred to her as “our son number two,” at the request of Weil, and in letters to her parents while a student, she used the masculine form of French participles and signed her name the masculine "Simon".<ref name=thurman>{{Cite magazine |last=Thurman |first=Judith |date=2024-09-02 |title=The Supreme Contradictions of Simone Weil |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/09/09/simone-weil-a-life-in-letters-robert-chenavier-andre-a-devaux-book-review |access-date=2024-09-20 |magazine=The New Yorker |language=en-US |issn=0028-792X}}</ref>

==Academic studies==
Weil was a precocious student and was proficient in [[Ancient Greek]] by age 12. She later learned [[Sanskrit]] so that she could read the [[Bhagavad Gita]] in the original.<ref name=":0"/>

As a teenager, Weil studied at the Lycée Henri IV under the tutelage of her admired teacher [[Émile Chartier]], more commonly known as "Alain".<ref>{{cite book | last=Hellman | first=John | title=Simone Weil: An Introduction to her Thought | publisher=Wilrid Laurier University Press | year=1982}}</ref>

Weil attracted much attention at the Lycée Henri IV with her radical opinions and actions such as organising against the military draft.<ref name=":7" /> For these reasons she was called the "Red Virgin", and even "The Martian" by her mentor.<ref name="bandw">{{cite web |last=Liukkonen |first=Petri |title=Simone Weil |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/weil.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424181411/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/weil.htm |archive-date=24 April 2007 |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland}}</ref><ref>Alain, "Journal" (unpublished). Cited in Petrement, ''Weil'', 1:6.</ref> Weil gained a reputation for her strict devotion to ethics, with classmates referring to her as the "[[categorical imperative]] in skirts".<ref name=":7" /> Officials at the school were outraged by her indifference to clothing, her refusal to participate in their traditions, and her ignoring a rule banning women from smoking with male students, for which she was suspended.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |page=67|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref>

At ENS, Weil briefly met [[Simone de Beauvoir]], and their meeting led to disagreement. Weil stated that, "one thing alone mattered in the world today: the revolution that would feed all people on earth," with a young Beauvoir replying that the point of life was to find meaning, not happiness. Weil cut her off, stating that, "it's easy to see you've never gone hungry".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |page=68|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref> 

Weil finished first in the exam for the certificate of "General Philosophy and Logic" with Simone de Beauvoir finishing second.<ref name="bandw" /> In 1931 Weil earned her DES (''{{Interlanguage link|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]]), with a thesis titled, "Science et perception dans Descartes" ("Science and Perception in Descartes").<ref name="Schrift">{{cite book |title=Simone Weil: Complete Works I "Premieres Écrits Philosophiques" |publisher=Gallimard |year=1988 |page=161}}</ref> She received her ''[[agrégation]]'' that same year.<ref>{{cite web |author=André Chervel |title=Les agrégés de l'enseignement secondaire.

==Work and political activism==
[[File:Lev Trotsky.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leon Trotsky]], for whom Weil arranged a period of residence at her parents' apartment in Paris in December 1933. Weil was one of the rare few who appeared to hold her own with the [[Red Army]] founder.<ref>Simone Pétrement (1988); pp. 189–191</ref>]]

She often became involved in political action out of sympathy with the [[working class]]. In 1915, when she was only six years old, she refused sugar in solidarity with the troops entrenched along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1919, at 10 years of age, she declared herself a [[Bolshevik]]. In her late teens, she became involved in the workers' movement. She wrote political tracts, marched in demonstrations and advocated workers' rights. At this time, she was a [[Marxist]], [[pacifist]] and [[trade union]]ist.

=== Teaching in Le Puy ===
While teaching in [[Le Puy-en-Velay|Le Puy]], she became involved in local political activity, supporting local striking workers underpaid by the City Council. Weil joined protest marches with them and even shared wine with them facing criticism from local elites and facing an [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] attack in a local paper.'''<ref name=":7" />''' When the school director called Weil in for questioning, students and coworkers rallied behind her and ultimately the city council raised the pay of the workers.<ref name=":7" /> Weil often held classes outdoors, often refused to share grades with school leadership, and is said to have created a "family atmosphere".<ref name=":9">{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |page=16|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref> She also took weekly visits to [[Saint-Étienne]] to teach workers [[French literature]], believing literature could be a tool for revolution and give workers ownership over their heritage and revolution.<ref name=":9" />

=== Factory work and travels ===
Weil began to feel her work was too narrow and elite telling her students it was an error to "reason in place of finding out" and that philosophy was a matter of action based in truth and that truth must be based in something (something lived or experienced).<ref name=":7" /> This led Weil to leave Le Puy to work in factories and experience the repetitive machine like work began her definition of ''le malheur'' (affliction) with workers reduced to a machine-like existence where they could not consider rebellion.<ref name=":7" />

Weil never formally joined the [[French Communist Party]], and in her twenties she became increasingly critical of Marxism. According to Pétrement, she was one of the first to identify a new form of oppression not anticipated by Marx, where élite bureaucrats could make life just as miserable for ordinary people as did the most exploitative capitalists.<ref name="Simone Pétrement 1988; p. 176">Simone Pétrement (1988); p. 176</ref> Weil critiqued [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theorists]] stating "they themselves have never been cogs in the machinery of factory".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |page=69|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref> Weil also doubted aspects of revolution stating revolution is a word for "which you kill, for which you die, for which you send the laboring masses to their death, but which does not possess any content".<ref name=":9" /> Weil felt oppression was not limited to any particular division of labor but flows from ''la puissance'' or [[Power (social and political)|power]] which affects all people.<ref name=":9" />

In 1932, Weil visited Germany to help Marxist activists who were at the time considered to be the strongest and best organised communists in Western Europe, but Weil considered them no match for the then up-and-coming fascists. When she returned to France, her political friends there dismissed her fears, thinking Germany would continue to be controlled by the centrists or by those to the left. After Hitler rose to power in 1933, Weil spent much of her time trying to help German communists fleeing his regime.<ref name="Simone Pétrement 1988; p. 176"/> Weil would sometimes publish articles about social and economic issues, including "Oppression and Liberty," as well as numerous short articles for trade union journals. This work criticised popular Marxist thought and gave a pessimistic account of the limits of both [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. The work however uses a Marxist method of analysis paying attention to oppression, critiquing Weil's own position as an intellectual, advances manual labor, and advances theory and practice.<ref name=":12" /> [[Leon Trotsky]] himself personally responded to several of her articles, attacking both her ideas and her as a person. However, according to Pétrement, he was influenced by some of Weil's thought.<ref>Simone Pétrement (1988); p. 178</ref>

In 1933, Weil was dismissed from a teaching job in [[Auxerre]] and transferred to [[Roanne]].<ref name=":13">{{Cite web |title=American Weil Society - Simone Weil |url=https://www.americanweilsociety.org/about_weil |access-date=2024-08-09 |website=www.americanweilsociety.org}}</ref> Weil participated in the French [[general strike]] of 1933, called to protest against unemployment and [[Wage labour|wage]] cuts. The following year, she took a 12-month [[leave of absence]] from her teaching position to work incognito as a labourer in two factories, one owned by [[Alstom]] and one by [[Renault]], believing that this experience would allow her to connect with the working class. In 1935, she began teaching in [[Bourges]] and started ''Entre Nous'', a journal that was produced and authored by factory workers.<ref name=":13" /> Weil donated most of her income to political causes and charitable endeavours.

=== Participation in Spanish Civil War ===
Weil participated in the 1936 Paris factory occupations and planned on returning to factory work In 1936 but became focused on the Spanish Civil War. Despite her professed [[pacifism]], she travelled to the [[Spanish Civil War]] to join the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]]. She identified as an [[anarchist]],<ref>{{cite book | author=McLellan, David | title=Utopian Pessimist: The Life and Thought of Simone Weil | url=https://archive.org/details/utopianpessimist00mclerich | url-access=registration | publisher=Poseidon Press | year=1990| isbn=0-671-68521-X}} p121</ref> and sought out the [[anti-fascist]] commander [[Julián Gorkin]], asking to be sent on a mission as a covert agent to rescue the prisoner [[Joaquín Maurín]]. Gorkin refused, saying Weil would be sacrificing herself for nothing since it was highly unlikely that she could pass as a Spaniard. Weil replied that she had "every right"<ref>Simone Pétrement (1988); p. 271</ref> to sacrifice herself if she chose, but after arguing for more than an hour, she was unable to convince Gorkin to give her the assignment. Instead she joined the anarchist [[Durruti Column]] of the French-speaking [[Sébastien Faure Century]], which specialised in high-risk "commando"-style engagements.<ref>Simone Pétrement (1988); p. 272</ref> 

As she was extremely nearsighted, Weil was a very poor shot, and her comrades tried to avoid taking her on missions, though she did sometimes insist. Her only direct participation in combat was to shoot with her rifle at a bomber during an air raid; in a second raid, she tried to operate the group's [[heavy machine gun]], but her comrades prevented her, as they thought it would be best for someone less clumsy and near-sighted to use the weapon. After being with the group for a few weeks, she burnt herself over a cooking fire. She was forced to leave the unit, and was met by her parents who had followed her to Spain. They helped her leave the country, to recuperate in [[Assisi]]. About a month after her departure, Weil's unit was nearly wiped out at an engagement in [[Perdiguera]] in October 1936, with every woman in the group being killed.<ref>Simone Pétrement (1988); p. 278</ref> During her stay in the [[Aragon]] front, Weil sent some chronicles to the French publication ''[[Le Libertaire]]'', and on returning to Paris, she continued to write essays on [[Labour relations|labour]], on [[management]], [[war]], and [[peace]].<ref>Simone Pétrement (1988); pp. 280–330</ref> 

Weil was distressed by the Republican killings in eastern Spain, particularly when a fifteen-year-old [[Falangist]] was executed after he had been taken prisoner and Durruti had spent an hour trying to persuade him to change his political position before giving him until the next day to decide.<ref>Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939. Hachette UK, 2012.</ref> Weil was deeply concerned by the intoxication of war where humans learn they can kill without punishment stating "I was horrified, but not surprised by the war crimes. I felt the possibility of doing the same - and it's precisely because I felt I had that potential that I was horrified."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |page=63|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref>

=== Marseilles ===
After the rise of Nazi Germany Weil renounced pacifism. Weil stated that, "non-violence is good only if it's effective," and she became committed to fighting the Nazi regime, even if it required force.<ref name=":14" /> After German attacks on France, Weil left Paris with her family and fled to Marseilles.<ref name=":12">{{Citation |last1=Rozelle-Stone |first1=A.

With the editorial help of Weil’s spiritual consultant (and sparring partner) Fr. Perrin, selections of these writings first made Weil widely known in the Anglo-American world."}}</ref> Weil encouraged her parents to buy a farm in the [[Ardèche]] where they could sustain themselves and work but Weil's family thought it safer to plan to move to America.<ref name=thurman/>

==Encounters with mysticism==
[[File:Bazylika Santa Maria degli Angeli Asyż.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli]] in Assisi where Simone had one of three spiritual "encounters that really counted," leading to her conversion to Christianity<ref>S. Weil, ''Spiritual Autobiography''</ref>]]

Weil was born into a secular household and raised in "complete agnosticism".<ref>S.

In her ''Spiritual Autobiography'', however, Weil records that she always had a Christian outlook, taking to heart from her earliest childhood the idea of loving one's neighbour. 

Weil was attracted to the Christian faith beginning in 1935, when she had the first of three pivotal religious experiences: being moved by the beauty of villagers singing hymns in a [[procession]] she stumbled across while on holiday to Portugal (in [[Póvoa de Varzim]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=George A Panichas|title=Simone Weil Reader|pages = xxxviii|year=1977|isbn=0-918825-01-6|publisher = Moyer Bell}}</ref><ref name="Sian">{{cite book|author=Simone Weil|editor= Sian Miles|pages = 28–29|title = An Anthology|year = 2005|isbn = 0-14-118819-7|publisher = Penguin Book}}</ref> Weil the later wrote "the conviction was suddenly borne in upon her that Christianity is pre-eminently the religion of slaves, that slaves cannot help belonging to it, and she among others."<ref name=":12" /> 

While in Assisi during the spring of 1937, Weil experienced a [[religious ecstasy]] in the [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli]]—the same church in which [[Saint]] [[Francis of Assisi]] had prayed. She was led to pray for the first time in her life as [[Lawrence S. Cunningham]] relates:
<blockquote>Below the town is the beautiful church and convent of San Damiano where [[Clare of Assisi|Saint Clare]] once lived. Near that spot is the place purported to be where Saint Francis composed the larger part of his "Canticle of Brother Sun". Below the town in the valley is the ugliest church in the entire environs: the massive baroque basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels, finished in the seventeenth century and rebuilt in the nineteenth century, which houses a rare treasure: a tiny Romanesque chapel that stood in the days of Saint Francis—the "Little Portion" where he would gather his brethren. It was in that tiny chapel that the great mystic Simone Weil first felt compelled to kneel down and pray.<ref>Cunningham, Lawrence S. (2004). ''Francis of Assisi: performing the Gospel life''.

Weil had a third, more powerful, [[revelation]] a year later while reciting [[George Herbert]]'s poem ''Love III'', after which "Christ himself came down and took possession of me",<ref>cited by Panichas and other Weil scholars,</ref> and, from 1938 on, her writings became more [[mystical]] and [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual]], while retaining their focus on [[social relation|social]] and [[political]] issues. In 1938 Weil visited the Benedictine Solesmes Abbey and while suffering from headaches she found pure joy in Gregorian chant that she felt the "possibility of living divine love in the midst of affliction".<ref name=":12" />

She was attracted to [[Catholicism]], but declined to be [[baptized]] at that time, preferring to remain outside due to "the love of those things that are outside Christianity".<ref>S.

Weil did not limit her curiosity to Christianity. She was interested in other religious traditions—especially the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]]; [[Hinduism]] (especially the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]]); and [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. She believed that all these and other traditions contained elements of genuine revelation,<ref name="Eliot">{{cite book|author=Simone Weil|title=The Need for Roots|page = xi, preface by [[T. S.

Nevertheless, Weil was opposed to religious [[syncretism]], claiming that it effaced the particularity of the individual traditions:
<blockquote>Each religion is alone true, that is to say, that at the moment we are thinking of it we must bring as much attention to bear on it as if there were nothing else ... A "synthesis" of religion implies a lower quality of attention.<ref>''Notebooks of Simone Weil'', volume 1</ref></blockquote>

==Later years==
[[File:Simone Weil plaque - NYC home.jpg|thumb|221x221px|A commemorative plaque on the exterior of the apartment building on [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] in [[New York City]] where Weil lived in 1942]]
In 1942, Weil travelled to the United States with her family. She had been reluctant to leave France, but agreed to do so as she wanted to see her parents to safety and knew they would not leave without her. She was also encouraged by the fact that it would be relatively easy for her to reach Britain from the United States, where she could join the [[French Resistance]]. She had hopes of being sent back to France as a covert agent.<ref>Simone Pétrement (1988); chpt. 15 'Marseilles II', see esp. pp. 462-463.</ref>

Older biographies suggest Weil made no further progress in achieving her desire to return to France as an agent—she was limited to desk work in London analyzing reports from resistance movements, although this did give her time to write one of her largest and best known works: ''[[The Need for Roots]]''.<ref>This was originally a lengthy report on options for regenerating France after an allied victory, though it was later published as a book.</ref> During this time Weil would also write ''Draft for a Statement of Human Obligations'' and ''Note on the General Suppression of Political Parties.''<ref name=":12" />

Yet there is now evidence that Weil was recruited by the [[Special Operations Executive]], with a view to sending her back to France as a clandestine wireless operator. In May 1943, preparations were underway to send her to [[Thame Park]] in Oxfordshire for training, but the plan was cancelled soon after, as her failing health became known.<ref>[http://blog.seteuropeablaze.com/2012/11/simone-weil.html "Simone Weil" by Nigel Perrin]. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20121210045454/http://blog.seteuropeablaze.com/2012/11/simone-weil.html |date=10 December 2012 }}</ref><ref>Simone Weil Personal File, ref.

[[File:SimoneWeilGraveAug2012.jpg|thumb|right|Weil's grave in Bybrook Cemetery, [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], [[Kent]], August 2012]]
Weil wrote furiously during this period sending a plethora of proposals though she was frustrated by feeling she was too safe and not doing enough to address the suffering.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |page=11|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref> De Gaulle rejected her plans and forces were not willing to send her back to France to join the resistance more directly.<ref name=":8" />

The rigorous work routine she assumed soon took a heavy toll.

However, she refused special treatment because of her long-standing [[political idealism]] and her detachment from material things. Instead, she limited her intake to what she believed residents of [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German-occupied France]] ate. She most likely ate even less, as she refused on most occasions. It is possible that she was baptized during this period.<ref>Eric O.

==Death==
After a lifetime of battling illness and frailty, Weil died in August 1943 from [[cardiac failure]] at the age of 34. The coroner's report said that "the deceased did kill and slay herself by refusing to eat whilst the balance of her mind was disturbed".<ref>{{cite book | author=McLellan, David | title=Utopian Pessimist: The Life and Thought of Simone Weil | url=https://archive.org/details/utopianpessimist00mclerich | url-access=registration | publisher=Poseidon Press | year=1990| isbn=0-671-68521-X }}, Inquest verdict quoted on p. 266.</ref>

The exact cause of her death remains a subject of debate. Some claim that her refusal to eat came from her desire to express some form of solidarity toward the victims of the war. Others think that Weil's self-starvation occurred after her study of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].<ref>McLellan, David (1990). ''Utopian Pessimist: The Life and Thought of Simone Weil''. Poseidon Press., p. 30</ref> In his chapters on Christian saintly asceticism and salvation, Schopenhauer had described self-starvation as a preferred method of self-denial. However, Simone Pétrement,<ref>Pétrement, Simone (1988). Simone Weil: A life. Schocken, 592 pp.</ref> one of Weil's first and most significant biographers, regards the coroner's report as simply mistaken. Basing her opinion on letters written by the personnel of the sanatorium at which Simone Weil was treated, Pétrement affirms that Weil asked for food on different occasions while she was hospitalized and even ate a little bit a few days before her death; according to her, it was, in fact, Weil's poor health condition that eventually made her unable to eat.<ref>Simone Pétrement (1988); chpt. 17 'London', see esp. pp. 530-539.</ref>

Weil's first English biographer, [[Sir Richard Rees, 2nd Baronet|Richard Rees]], offers several possible explanations for her death, citing her compassion for the suffering of her countrymen in occupied France and her love for and close imitation of Christ. Rees sums up by saying: "As for her death, whatever explanation one may give of it will amount in the end to saying that she died of love."<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Sir Richard Rees, 2nd Baronet|Richard Rees]]|title=Simone Weil: A Sketch for a Portrait|url=https://archive.org/details/simoneweilsketch0000rees|url-access=registration|page = [https://archive.org/details/simoneweilsketch0000rees/page/191 191]|year=1966|isbn=0-19-211163-9|publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>

==Philosophy==
{{Christian mysticism}}

=== Absence ===
Absence is the key image for her [[metaphysics]], [[Religious cosmology|cosmology]], [[cosmogony]], and [[theodicy]]. She believed that God created by an act of self-delimitation—in other words, she argued that because God is conceived as utter fullness, a perfect being, no creature can exist except where God is not. Thus, creation occurred only when God withdrew in part. This idea mirrors [[tzimtzum]], a central notion in the Jewish [[Kabbalah]] creation narrative.

This is, for Weil, an original ''[[kenosis]]'' ("emptiness") preceding the corrective ''kenosis'' of [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Christ's incarnation]]. Thus, according to her, humans are born in a damned position, not because of [[original sin]], but because to be created at all they must be what God is not; in other words, they must be inherently "unholy" in some sense. This idea fits more broadly into [[apophatic theology]]. 

This notion of creation is a cornerstone of her [[theodicy]], for if creation is conceived this way{{Em dash}}as necessarily entailing [[evil]]{{Em dash}}then there is no [[problem of evil|problem of the entrance of evil]] into a perfect world. Nor does the presence of evil constitute a limitation of God's [[omnipotence]] under Weil's notion; according to her, evil is present not because God could not create a perfect world, but because the act of "creation" in its very [[essence]] implies the impossibility of perfection.

However, this explanation of the essentiality of evil does not imply that humans are simply, originally, and continually doomed; on the contrary, Weil claims that "evil is the form which God's [[mercy]] takes in this world".<ref>''Gravity and Grace'', Metaxu, page 132</ref> Weil believed that evil, and its consequent affliction, serve the role of driving humans towards God, writing, "The extreme affliction which overtakes human beings does not create human misery, it merely reveals it."<ref name=":14">Weil, Simone. ''Gravity and Grace''. Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1952.</ref>

=== Affliction ===

Weil developed the concept of "affliction" ({{Langx|fr|malheur}}) while working in factories with workers reduced to a machine-like existence where they could not consider real thought or rebellion with Weil stating "thought flies from affliction as promptly and irresistibly as an animal flees from death".<ref name=":7" /> Weil found this force too inhumane stating "affliction constrains a man to ask continually 'why' - the question to which there is essentially no reply" and nothing in the world can rob us of the power to say 'I' except for extreme affliction".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |pages=33, 37|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref>

According to her, only some souls are capable of experiencing the full depth of affliction{{Em dash}}the same souls that are also most able to experience spiritual joy. Weil's notion of affliction is a sort of "suffering plus" which transcends both body and mind, a physical and mental anguish that scourges the very soul.<ref>This notion of Weil's bears a strong resemblance to the Asian notion of ''han'', which has received attention in recent Korean theology, for instance in the work of Andrew Park. Like "affliction", ''han'' is more destructive to the whole person than ordinary suffering.</ref>

{{blockquote|The better we are able to conceive of the fullness of joy, the purer and more intense will be our suffering in affliction and our compassion for others. ...

Suffering and enjoyment as sources of knowledge. The serpent offered knowledge to Adam and Eve. The sirens offered knowledge to Ulysses. These stories teach that the soul is lost through seeking knowledge in pleasure. Why? Pleasure is perhaps innocent on condition that we do not seek knowledge in it. It is permissible to seek that only in suffering.

|sign= Simone Weil
|source= ''Gravity and Grace'' (chpt 16 'Affliction')
}}

=== ''Decreation'' ===
In Waiting for God Weil outlines the concept of decreation. Weil believed that If humans are to imitate God they must renounce their power and their autonomy. Weil refers to this as decreation (''décréation)'' which she referred to as "passive activity" or based on her childhood readings of the ''Bhagavad Gita'', “non-active action”.<ref name=":12" /> 

Weil's concept of necessity related to decreation. Weil felt that necessity includes physical forces as well as social forces.<ref name=":12" /> Weil felt that when an individual is self-centred they deny necessity. Consent to necessity means the only choice is whether or not they desire the good. For Weil, this type of consent is obtained metaphysically through decreation rather than through effort.<ref name=":12" />

=== ''Metaxu'': "Every separation is a link" ===
''[[Metaxy|Metaxu]]'', a concept Weil borrowed from [[Plato]], is that which both separates and connects (e.g., as the word 'cleave' means both to cut and join). This idea of connecting distance was of the first importance for Weil's understanding of the created realm. The world as a whole, along with any of its components, including the physical [[Human body|body]], is to be regarded as serving the same function for people in relation to God that a blind man's stick serves for him in relation to the world about him. They do not afford direct insight, but can be used experimentally to bring the mind into practical contact with reality. This metaphor allows any absence to be interpreted as a presence, and is a further component in Weil's theodicy. 

In ''Gravity and Grace'' Weil provides a metaphor to explain this concept "Two prisoners whose cells adjoin communicate with each other by knocking on the wall. The wall is the thing which separates them but it is also their means of communication. It is the same with us and God. Every separation is a link."<ref name=":12" />

=== Beauty ===

For Weil, "The beautiful is the experiential proof that the incarnation is possible". The beauty that is inherent in the form of the world (this inherency is proven, for her, in [[geometry]], and expressed in all good [[art]]) is the proof that the world points to something beyond itself; it establishes the essentially [[teleology|telic]] character of all that exists. In Weil's concept, beauty extends throughout the universe: <blockquote>"[W]e must have faith that the universe is beautiful on all levels...and that it has a fullness of beauty in relation to the bodily and psychic structure of each of the thinking beings that actually do exist and of all those that are possible. It is this very agreement of an infinity of perfect beauties that gives a transcendent character to the beauty of the world...He (Christ) is really present in the universal beauty. The love of this beauty proceeds from God dwelling in our souls and goes out to God present in the universe".<ref name="pp164">Weil, Simone. ''Waiting For God''. Harper Torchbooks, 1973, pp. 164–165.</ref></blockquote> She also wrote that "The beauty of this world is Christ's tender smile coming to us through matter".<ref name="pp164"/>

[[Beauty]] also served a [[soteriological]] function for Weil: "Beauty captivates the flesh in order to obtain permission to pass right to the soul." It constitutes, then, another way in which the [[divine]] reality behind the world invades people's lives: where affliction conquers with brute force, beauty sneaks in and topples the empire of the self from within.

=== Philosophy in ''Waiting for God'' ===

==== Attention ====
As Weil explains in her book ''Waiting for God'', attention consists of suspending or emptying one's thought, such that one is ready to receive—to be penetrated by—the object to which one turns one's gaze, be that object one's neighbour, or ultimately, God.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weil, Simone |title=Waiting for God|date=1973|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0-06-090295-7|edition=1st Harper colophon|location=New York|pages=111–112|oclc=620927}}</ref> Weil states that "the capacity to give one's attention to a sufferer is a very rare and difficult thing: it is almost a miracle; it ''is'' a miracle".<ref name=":10">{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |pages=46|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref> Attention may be linked to compassion so that, with attention, one can identify with an afflicted individual letting go of ourselves and allowing the other person to have our attention. Weil contrasts this attention with pity describing pity as "it consists in helping someone in misfortune so as not to be obligated to think about him anymore, or for the pleasure of feeling distance between himself and oneself".<ref name=":10" />

As Weil explains, one can love God by praying to God, and attention is the very "substance of prayer": when one prays, one empties oneself, fixes one's whole gaze towards God, and becomes ready to receive God.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weil, Simone |title=Waiting for God|date=1973|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0-06-090295-7|edition=1st Harper colophon|location=New York|pages=105|oclc=620927}}</ref> Similarly, for Weil, people can love their neighbours by emptying themselves, becoming ready to receive one's neighbour in all their naked truth, asking one's neighbour: "What are you going through?"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weil, Simone |title=Waiting for God|date=1973|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0-06-090295-7|edition=1st Harper colophon|location=New York|pages=114–115|oclc=620927}}</ref> 

Weil further equates aspects of attention to love stating "To empty ourselves (French: ''Se vider)'' of our false divinity, to deny ourselves, to give up being the center of the world in imagination, to discern that all points in the world are equally centers and that the true center is outside the world, this is to consent to the rule of mechanical necessity in matter and of free choice at the center of each soul. Such consent is love. The face of this love, which is turned toward thinking persons, is the love of our neighbor."<ref name=":12" /> 

==== Three Forms of the Implicit Love of God ====
In ''Waiting for God'', Weil explains that the three forms of implicit love of God are (1) love of neighbour (2) love of the beauty of the world and (3) love of religious ceremonies.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weil, Simone |title=Waiting for God|date=1973|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0-06-090295-7|edition=1st Harper colophon|location=New York|pages=137–199|oclc=620927}}</ref> As Weil writes, by loving these three objects (neighbour, world's beauty and religious ceremonies), one indirectly loves God before "God comes in person to take the hand of his future bride," since prior to God's arrival, one's soul cannot yet ''directly'' love God as the object.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weil, Simone |title=Waiting for God|date=1973|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0-06-090295-7|edition=1st Harper colophon|location=New York|pages=137|oclc=620927}}</ref> Love of neighbour occurs (i) when the strong treat the weak ''as equals,''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weil, Simone |title=Waiting for God|date=1973|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0-06-090295-7|edition=1st Harper colophon|location=New York|pages=143–144|oclc=620927}}</ref> (ii) when people give personal attention to those that otherwise seem invisible, anonymous, or non-existent,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weil, Simone |title=Waiting for God|date=1973|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0-06-090295-7|edition=1st Harper colophon|location=New York|pages=149|oclc=620927}}</ref> and (iii) when people look at and listen to the afflicted ''as they are'', without explicitly thinking about God—i.e., Weil writes, when "God in us" loves the afflicted, ''rather'' than people loving them in God.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weil, Simone |title=Waiting for God|date=1973|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0-06-090295-7|edition=1st Harper colophon|location=New York|pages=150–151|oclc=620927}}</ref> Second, Weil explains, love of the world's beauty occurs when humans imitate God's love for the cosmos: just as God creatively renounced his command over the world—letting it be ruled by human autonomy and matter's "blind necessity"—humans give up their imaginary command over the world, seeing the world ''no longer'' as if they were the world's center.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weil, Simone |title=Waiting for God|date=1973|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0-06-090295-7|edition=1st Harper colophon|location=New York|pages=158–160|oclc=620927}}</ref> Finally, Weil explains, love of religious ceremonies occurs as an implicit love of God, when religious practices are pure.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weil, Simone |title=Waiting for God|date=1973|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0-06-090295-7|edition=1st Harper colophon|location=New York|pages=181|oclc=620927}}</ref> Weil writes that purity in religion is seen when "faith and love do not fail," and most absolutely, in the [[Eucharist]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weil, Simone |title=Waiting for God|date=1973|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0-06-090295-7|edition=1st Harper colophon|location=New York|pages=187|oclc=620927}}</ref>

==Works==
According to Lissa McCullough, Weil would likely have been "intensely displeased" by the attention paid to her life rather than her works. She believed it was her writings that embodied the best of her, not her actions and definitely not her personality. Weil had similar views about others, saying that if one looks at the lives of great figures in separation from their works, it "necessarily ends up revealing their pettiness above all", as it's in their works that they have put the best of themselves.<ref name="Lissa">{{cite book|author=Lissa McCullough|title=The Religious Philosophy of Simone Weil: An Introduction|pages = 1–3|year=2014|isbn=978-1-78076-796-3|publisher = [[I.B.

The essay focuses on the theme that Weil calls 'Force' in the ''[[Iliad]]'', which she defines as "that ''x'' which turns anyone subjected to it into a ''thing''."<ref name="Iliad Chicago">{{cite journal|last=Weil| first=Simone| year=1965| title=The ''Iliad'', or ''The Poem of Force''| journal=Chicago Review| volume=18| number=2| pages=5–30| doi=10.2307/25294008| jstor=25294008| translator=Mary McCarthy| url=http://biblio3.url.edu.gt/SinParedes/08/Weil-Poem-LM.pdf| access-date=10 April 2023}}</ref> In the opening sentences of the essay, she sets out her view of the role of Force in the poem:

<blockquote>
The true hero, the true subject, the centre of the ''Iliad'', is force. Force employed by man, force that enslaves man, force before which man's flesh shrinks away. In this work, at all times, the human spirit is shown as modified by its relations with force, as swept away, blinded, by the very force it imagined it could handle, as deformed by the weight of the force it submits to.{{R|Iliad Chicago|p=5}}
</blockquote>

''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' has described the essay as one of Weil's most celebrated works,<ref name = "SWanth"/> while it has also been described as among "the twentieth century's most beloved, tortured, and profound responses to the world's greatest and most disturbing poem."<ref>{{cite web

===''The Need for Roots''===
{{main|The Need for Roots}}

Weil's book ''The Need for Roots'' ({{langx|fr|L'Enracinement}}) was written in early 1943, immediately before her death later that year. In it Weil presents a morality based on compassion rather than the rule of law.<ref name=":12" /> At this time Weil was in London working for the [[French Resistance]] and trying to convince its leader, [[Charles de Gaulle]], to form a contingent of nurses, including Weil, who would parachute to the front lines.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |page=10|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref> Weil's intention was partially for these nurses to provide care, but also to offer an inspiring moral opposite to Nazism with Weil stating "it may be that our victory depends upon the presence among us of a corresponding inspiration, but authentic and pure".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |page=154|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref> 

''The Need for Roots'' has an ambitious plan. It sets out to address the past and to propose a road map for the future of France after World War&nbsp;II. She painstakingly analyzes the spiritual and ethical [[Social environment|milieu]] that led to France's defeat by the German army, and then addresses these issues with the prospect of eventual French victory.

==== Obligations vs Rights ====
Weil felt that "all human beings are bound by identical obligations, although they are performed in different ways according to particular circumstances." and that "duty to the human being as such - that alone is eternal".<ref name=":11">{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |pages=105, 129|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref> Weil differentiates between rights and obligations viewing the two as subject and object. "The actual relationship between the two is as between object and subject. A man, considered in isolation, only has duties, amongst which are certain duties towards himself. Other men, seen from his point of view, only have rights. He, in his turn, has rights, when seen from the point of view of other men, who recognize that they have obligations towards him. A man left alone in the universe would have no rights whatever, but he would have obligations."<ref name=":11" /> Weil elaborates supporting the idea that obligations alone are independent stating "rights are always found to be related to certain conditions. Obligations alone remain independent of conditions." with obligations being a universal condition "All human beings are bound by identical obligations, although these are performed in different ways according to particular circumstances." whereas rights are conditional "...a right is not effectual by itself, but only in relation to the obligation to which it corresponds".<ref name=":11" />  

==== Defining roots ====
In this work Weil makes the case for roots or the idea that the persistence of people is tied to the persistence of their culture, their way of life, as carried through generations''.'' For Weil roots involved obligations to participate in community life, feel connected to place, and maintain links through time. The "roots" Weil refers to are nourishment that enable humans to fully grow and that a rooted community allows the individual to develop with a view toward God or eternal values.<ref>{{Cite news |last=McRobie |first=Heather |date=2009-02-03 |title=Should we still read Simone Weil? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/feb/03/religion-simone-weil |access-date=2024-08-02 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref name=":12" />

In contrast, a threat to the human soul is uprootedness (''déracinement'') is the condition of people where the only binding forces in society are money and the imagined nation.<ref name=":12" /> For industrial working conditions Weil states "although they have remained geographically stationary, they have been morally uprooted, banished and the reinstated as  it were on sufferance, in the form of industrial brawn".<ref name="Zaretsky 2020 102">{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |page=102|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref> Weil states that "money destroys human roots wherever it is able to penetrate" and it "manages to outweigh all other motives because the effort it demands of the mind is so much less...".<ref name="Zaretsky 2020 102" /> 

Weil opposed behavior that uprooted people including colonialism (including the French empire), some forms of mass media, and poor industrial working conditions. Weil did not excuse moral issues within a place, stating countries are a vital medium but one with good and evil and justice and injustice. Weil wrote passionately against the French government's colonial policies including the [[Civilizing mission|''mission civilisatrice'']] stating "we can no longer say or think that we have received from on high the mission  to teach the universe how to live." though Weil also opposed the creation of new nations based on the European model stating "there are already too many nations in the world"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |pages=111, 115|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref> 

==== Patriotism of Compassion ====
Weil was also not opposed to patriotism but saw it rooted not in pride but instead in compassion and that this compassion, unlike pride, can be extended to other nations stating compassion is "able, without hindrance, to cross frontiers extend itself over all countries in misfortune, overall countries without exception for all peoples are subjected to the wretchedness of the human condition".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zaretsky |first=Robert |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 |title=The Subversive Simone Weil |date=2020 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-54933-0 |page=117|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226549477.001.0001 }}</ref>

===''Gravity and Grace''===
While ''Gravity and Grace'' ({{langx|fr|La Pesanteur et la Grâce}}) is one of the books most associated with Simone Weil, the work was not intended to be a book at all. Rather, the work consists of various passages selected from Weil's notebooks and arranged topically by her friend Gustave Thibon. Weil had given Thibon some of her notebooks written before May 1942, but not with any intent to publish them. Hence, the resulting selections, organization and editing of ''Gravity and Grace'' were much influenced by Thibon, a devout Catholic (see Thibon's introduction to ''Gravity and Grace'' ([[Routledge]] & Kegan Paul, 1952) for more details).

Weil felt gravity and grace were opposites believing that gravity signifies the ''force'' of the natural world of which all beings are physically, materially, and socially affected and that this "pulls" attention away from God and the afflicted whereas grace is a form of justice and a counter-balance, motivated by the goodness of God. Weil felt that this gravity (force) and grace (justice) are the two most fundamental aspects of the world and came together at the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]].<ref name=":12" />

==Legacy==
[[Image:SimoneWeilAvenue.jpg|thumb|right|''Simone Weil Avenue'', a section of the [[A28 road]] which runs close to her grave in Ashford, was named in honour of the philosopher in 1983.]]
During her lifetime, Weil was known only in relatively narrow circles and even in France her essays were mostly read only by those interested in radical politics. During the first decade after her death, Weil rapidly became famous, attracting attention throughout the West. For the third quarter of the 20th century, she was widely regarded as the most influential person in the world on new work concerning religious and spiritual matters.<ref>Even some of her critics conceded this, see Hellman (1982), p. 4-5</ref> Her philosophical,<ref>Note, however, that while Weil's philosophical work received much popular attention, including by intellectuals, she was relatively little studied by professional philosophers, especially in the English-speaking world, despite philosophy being the subject in which she was professionally trained. See, for example, the Introduction of ''Simone Weil: "The Just Balance"'' by [[Peter Winch]], which is an excellent source for a philosophical discussion of her ideas, especially for those interested in the overlap between her work and that of Wittgenstein.</ref> social and political thought also became popular, although not to the same degree as her religious work.<ref>Various scholars have listed her among the top five French political writers of the first half of the twentieth century, see Hellman (1982), p. 4-5.</ref>

Aside from influencing various fields of study, Weil deeply affected the personal lives of numerous individuals. [[Pope Paul VI]] said that Weil was one of his three greatest influences.<ref>The other two being [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Georges Bernanos]]; see Hellman (1982), p. 1</ref> Weil's popularity began to decline in the late 1960s and 1970s. However, more of her work was gradually published, leading to many thousands of new secondary works by Weil scholars, some of whom focused on achieving a deeper understanding of her religious, philosophical and political work. Others broadened the scope of Weil scholarship to investigate her applicability to fields like classical studies, cultural studies, education, and even technical fields like ergonomics.<ref name="Sian"/>

Many commentators have given highly positive assessments of Weil as a person; some describe her as a saint, even as the greatest saint of the twentieth century, including [[T.&nbsp;S. Eliot]], [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Leslie Fiedler]], and [[Robert Coles (psychiatrist)|Robert Coles]].<ref>See Hellman (1982) for a list her biographers who have portrayed her as a saint.</ref> After they met at age 18, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] wroteː "I envied her for having a heart that could beat right across the world."<ref name="compassion"/> Weil biographer Gabriella Fiori writes that Weil was "a moral genius in the orbit of ethics, a genius of immense revolutionary range."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110516165930/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1120206.html "The Lonely Pilgrimage of Simone Weil", ''The Washington Post'']</ref> [[Maurice Schumann]] said that since her death there was "hardly a day when the thought of her life did not positively influence his own and serve as a moral guide."<ref name="compassion">

Weil has been criticised, however, even by those who otherwise admired her deeply, such as T. S. Eliot, for being excessively prone to divide the world into good and evil, and for her sometimes intemperate judgments. Weil was a harsh critic of the influence of [[Judaism]] on Western civilisation.<ref name="Eliot"/> However, her niece Sylvie Weil and biographer Thomas R. Nevin argue that Weil did not reject Judaism and was heavily influenced by its precepts.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ivry|first=Benjamin|title=Simone Weil's Rediscovered Jewish Inspiration|date=30 March 2009|url=http://forward.com/articles/104410/simone-weil-s-rediscovered-jewish-inspiration/|publisher=The Jewish Daily Forward}}</ref> Weil was an even harsher critic of the [[Roman Empire]], in which she refused to see any value.<ref>She even disliked Romans who are normally admired by progressives, such as [[Virgil]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], and [[Tacitus]], reserving moderate praise only for the [[Gracchi]].</ref> On the other hand, according to Eliot, she held up the [[Cathar]]s as exemplars of goodness, despite there being in his view little concrete evidence on which to base such an assessment.<ref name="Eliot"/> According to Pétrement she idolised [[Lawrence of Arabia]], considering him to be a saint.<ref>Simone Pétrement (1988), p. 329, 334</ref> A few critics have taken an overall negative view.

== Weil in film, stage, and media ==
"Approaching Simone" is a play created by [[Megan Terry]]. Dramatizing the life, philosophy and death of Simone Weil, Terry's play won the 1969/1970 Obie Award for Best Off-Broadway Play.

Weil was the subject of a 2010 documentary by [[Julia Haslett]], ''An encounter with Simone Weil''. Haslett noted that Weil had become "a little-known figure, practically forgotten in her native France, and rarely taught in universities or secondary schools".<ref name="encounter">
{{cite magazine|author=Doris Toumarkine|date=23 March 2012|title=Film Review: An Encounter with Simone Weil|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/reviews/specialty-releases/e3i59680f3eef11d7a35cc72dadb3f24ff4|magazine=Film Journal International|access-date=31 August 2012}}

Weil was also the subject of Finnish composer [[Kaija Saariaho]]'s ''La Passion de Simone'' (2008), written with librettist [[Amin Maalouf]]. Of the piece, music critic [[Olivia Giovetti]] wrote:

<blockquote>Framing her soprano soloist as Simone's imaginary sister (Literal? Metaphorical? Does it matter?), the narrative arc becomes a struggle to understand the dichotomy of Simone. Wrapped in this dramatic mystery, Saariaho's musical textures, haunting and moribund, create a meditative state. To go back to Bach's St. Matthew Passion, if that work, written for his time, serves to reinforce the (then-revolutionary) system of the Protestant church, then "La Passion de Simone," written for our time, questions the mystery of faith to reinforce the inexplicable experience of being human.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-03-01|title=Deep Listen: Kaija Saariaho • VAN Magazine|url=https://van-us.atavist.com/deep-listen-kaija-saariaho|access-date=2020-09-20|website=VAN Magazine|language=en}}{{Dead link|date=November 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>

Chris Kraus' 1996 film ''Gravity and Grace'' alludes to the posthumous work of Simone Weil. Chris Kraus' 2000 novel ''Aliens & Anorexia'' chronicles her experience producing the film while also touching on Kraus' personal study and interaction with Simone Weil's philosophy and life.  

T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, Czeslaw Milosz, Seamus Heaney, Flannery O’Connor, Susan Sontag, and Anne Carson all cite Weil as an inspiration of their books and literature.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Rozelle-Stone |first1=A.

[[Clancy (album)|Clancy]], a character from [[Twenty One Pilots]]’ albums [[Trench (album)|Trench]], [[Scaled and Icy]], and [[Clancy (album)|Clancy]] reflects themes inspired by the French philosopher Simone Weil. Like Weil, who critiqued oppression and explored the quest for spiritual freedom, Clancy's journey through the oppressive city of Dema, ruled by tyrannical bishops, mirrors Weil's critiques of oppressive systems and her emphasis on the quest for spiritual freedom. The connection is further highlighted by the leader of Dema, Nico, a reference to [[Nicolas Bourbaki]], a pseudonym linked to Weil's brother, [[André Weil]]. Additionally, the bishops’ religion, Vialism, pronounced similarly to "Weilism," hints at a direct homage to Simone Weil, underscoring the album's exploration of suffering, awareness, and the search for truth, key themes in Weil's work.
