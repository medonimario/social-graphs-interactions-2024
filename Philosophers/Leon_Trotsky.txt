Born into a wealthy [[Jewish]] family in Ukraine, then part of the [[Russian Empire]], Trotsky joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] in 1898. He was arrested for revolutionary activities and exiled to [[Siberia]], but in 1902 escaped to London, where he met Lenin and wrote for the party's newspaper ''[[Iskra]]''. Trotsky sided with [[Julius Martov]]'s [[Mensheviks]] against Lenin's [[Bolsheviks]] after the party's 1903 schism, but declared himself non-factional in 1904. During the failed 1905 Revolution, Trotsky returned to Russia and was elected chairman of the [[Saint Petersburg Soviet]]. He was again exiled to Siberia, but escaped in 1907 and spent time in London, Vienna, Switzerland, Paris, and New York. After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 [[Abdication of Nicholas II|overthrew the tsar]], Trotsky returned to Russia and joined the Bolsheviks. As chairman of the [[Petrograd Soviet]], he played an important role in the October Revolution that overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]].

In [[Lenin's first government]], Trotsky was appointed as the [[People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs]] (Foreign Minister) and led negotiations for the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], by which Russia withdrew from [[World War I]]. From 1918 to 1925, he served as the [[People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs]] (Defence Minister); he founded the [[Red Army]] and led it to victory in the Russian Civil War.

He lived in Turkey, France, and Norway before settling in Mexico in 1937.

In exile, Trotsky wrote polemically against [[Stalinism]], supporting [[proletarian internationalism]] against Stalin's theory of "[[socialism in one country]]". Trotsky's theory of "[[permanent revolution]]" posited that the socialist revolution could only survive if spread to advanced capitalist countries. In ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]'' (1936), Trotsky argued that the Soviet Union had become a "[[degenerated workers' state]]" due to its isolation, and called for an end to Stalin's dictatorship. He founded the [[Fourth International]] in 1938 as an alternative to the [[Comintern]]. In 1936, Trotsky was sentenced to death ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' at the first of the [[Moscow show trials]], and in 1940, was assassinated at his home in Mexico City by Stalinist agent [[Ramón Mercader]].

[[Damnatio memoriae|Written out of Soviet history]] under Stalin, Trotsky was one of the few of Stalin's rivals who was never [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|politically rehabilitated]] by later leaders.

Leon Trotsky was born Lev Davidovich Bronstein to David Leontyevich Bronstein (1847–1922) and Anna Lvovna (née Zhivotovskaya, 1850–1910) on 7 November 1879, the fifth child of a wealthy Jewish family in Yanovka, [[Kherson Governorate|Kherson governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Bereslavka, Ukraine|Bereslavka]], Ukraine).<ref name=":0" /> His father, David Leontyevich, had lived in [[Poltava]] and later moved to Bereslavka, as it had a large Jewish community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://focus.ua/news/9045/|title=Наш Троцкий – ФОКУС|website=ФОКУС|date=14 September 2007|language=uk|access-date=26 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817203621/https://focus.ua/news/9045/|archive-date=17 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|pp=6–7}} Trotsky's younger sister, [[Olga Kameneva|Olga]], who also grew up to be a [[Bolshevik]] and a Soviet politician, married the prominent Bolshevik [[Lev Kamenev]].{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=69}}

Some authors, notably [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]], have claimed that Trotsky's childhood first name was [[Yiddish]] ''Leiba''.{{sfn|Service|2010|p=11}} The American [[Trotskyist]] [[David North (socialist)|David North]] said that this was an assumption based on Trotsky's Jewish birth, but, contrary to Service's claims, there is no documentary evidence to support his using a Yiddish name, when that language was not spoken by his family.{{sfn|North|2010|pp=144–146}} Both North and political historian [[Walter Laqueur]] wrote that Trotsky's childhood name was ''Lyova'', a standard [[Russian language|Russian]] diminutive of the name ''Lev''.{{sfn|Laqueur|1990|pp=59–60}} North has compared the speculation on Trotsky's given name to the undue emphasis given to his having a Jewish surname.{{sfn|North|2010|pp=144–146}}{{sfn|Laqueur|1990|pp=59–60}} The language spoken at home was not Yiddish<ref>{{Cite book |last=Троцкий |first=Лев |title=Моя жизнь |year=1930 |location=Berlin |pages=22,109 |language=Russian}}</ref> but a mixture of Russian and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], known as [[Surzhyk]].{{sfn|North|2010|p=145}} Although Trotsky spoke French, English, and German to a good standard, he said in his autobiography ''[[My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)|My Life]]'' that he was never fluent in any language but Russian.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=My Life – Chapter VIII, My First Prisons |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/mylife/ch08.htm |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=20 May 2021}}</ref> [[Raymond Molinier]] wrote that Trotsky spoke French fluently.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.revolutionary-history.co.uk/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604005522/http://.revolutionary-history.co.uk/supplem/bronstein.htm|url-status=usurped|title=On Meeting with Trotsky|first1=Raymond|last1=Molinier|translator-first1=Ted| translator-last1=Crawford|archive-date=4 June 2007|access-date=29 January 2022}}</ref>

== Early political activities and life (1896–1917) ==
=== Revolutionary activity and imprisonment (1896–1898) ===
[[File:LeonTrotsky1897.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|Lev Davidovich Bronstein, 1897]]

Trotsky became involved in revolutionary activities in 1896 after moving to the harbor town of [[Mykolaiv|Nikolayev]] on the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=36}} At first a ''[[narodnik]]'' (revolutionary [[agrarian socialist]] [[populist]]), he initially opposed [[Marxism]] but was won over by his future first wife, [[Aleksandra Sokolovskaya]]. That same year, he graduated from his high school with a first class honours.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=39}} According to his relative, Valery Bronstein, his father had intended for Trotsky to become a [[mechanical engineer]] after leaving modern school.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Brotherstone |editor1-first=Terence |editor2-last=Dukes |editor2-first=Paul |title=The Trotsky reappraisal |date=1992 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-7486-0317-6 |page=8}}</ref>

Trotsky briefly attended [[Odessa University]] studying [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]].{{sfn|Renton|2004|p=19}} He dropped out in early 1897 to help organize the South Russian Workers' Union in Nikolayev. Trotsky's university colleague and a prominent engineer who served as the Technical Director of the [[Baltic Shipyard]] had noted that he displayed an exceptional gift for mathematics.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=39}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eastman |first1=Max |title=Leon Trotsky: the Portrait of a Youth |date=1970 |publisher=AMS Press |isbn=978-0-404-02235-8 |page=68 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=koErAQAAMAAJ&q=Leon+Trotsky:+The+Portrait+of+a+Youth |language=en}}</ref> Using the name "Lvov",<ref name=":4">chapter XVII of his autobiography, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch07.htm ''My Life''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119141154/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch07.htm |date=19 November 2005}}, Marxist Internet Archive</ref> he wrote and printed leaflets and proclamations, distributed revolutionary pamphlets, and popularized socialist ideas among industrial workers and revolutionary students.{{sfn|Renton|2004|pp=22–24}}

In January 1898, more than 200 members of the union, including Trotsky, were arrested. He was held for the next two years in prison awaiting trial, first in Nikolayev, then [[Kherson]], then Odessa, and finally in Moscow.<ref>Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made Against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials,&nbsp;''The Case of Leon Trotsky''&nbsp;(1937, reprinted 1968).</ref> In the Moscow prison, he came into contact with other revolutionaries, heard about Lenin and read Lenin's book, ''[[The Development of Capitalism in Russia]]''.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=40}} Two months into his imprisonment, on 1–3 March 1898, the first Congress of the newly formed [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) was held.{{sfn|Schapiro|1970|p=645}} From then on Trotsky identified as a member of the party.

=== First marriage and Siberian exile (1899–1902) ===
{{Main|First exile of Trotsky}}
[[File:Leo Trotzki 1897.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Trotsky's first wife Aleksandra Sokolovskaya with her brother (left), Trotsky (right), Dr Ziv (bottom) in 1897]]
While imprisoned in Moscow, in the summer of 1899, Trotsky married Aleksandra Sokolovskaya (1872–1938), a fellow Marxist. The ceremony was performed by a Jewish chaplain.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=42}} In 1900, he was sentenced to four years  exile in [[Siberia]]. Because of their marriage, Trotsky and his wife were allowed to be exiled to the same location in Siberia: [[Ust-Kut]] and the Verkholensk in the [[Baikal Lake]] region. They had two daughters, [[Zinaida Volkova|Zinaida]] (1901–1933) and Nina (1902–1928), born in Siberia.

In Siberia, Trotsky studied philosophy.{{sfn|Warth|1978|p=22}} He became aware of the differences within the party, which had been decimated by arrests in 1898 and 1899. Some social democrats known in [[Soviet phraseology|Leninist phraseology]] as "[[Economism|economists]]" argued the party should focus on helping industrial workers improve their lot and were less concerned with changing the government.{{sfn|Schapiro|1970|pp=31–32}} They believed that societal reforms would grow out of the worker's struggle for higher pay and better working conditions. Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential. The latter position was expressed by the London-based newspaper ''[[Iskra]]'' (''The Spark''), founded in 1900. Trotsky quickly sided with the ''Iskra'' position and began writing for the paper.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=67}}

In the summer of 1902, at the urging of his wife, Aleksandra, Trotsky escaped from Siberia hidden in hay.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=55}} Aleksandra later escaped with their daughters.{{sfn|Warth|1978|p=22}} Both daughters married, and Zinaida had children, but the daughters died before their parents. Nina Nevelson died from [[tuberculosis]] in 1928, cared for in her last months by her older sister. Zinaida Volkova followed her father into exile in [[Berlin]], taking her son by her second marriage but leaving behind a daughter in Russia. Suffering also from tuberculosis and [[Mood disorder|depression]], Zinaida committed suicide in 1933. Aleksandra disappeared in 1935 during the [[Great Purge]]s under Stalin and was murdered by Soviet forces three years later.

=== First emigration and second marriage (1902–1903) ===
Until this point, Trotsky had used his birth name: Lev (Leon) Bronstein.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=7}} He changed his surname to "Trotsky", the name he would use for the rest of his life. It is said he adopted the name of a jailer of the Odessa prison in which he had earlier been held.<ref>cf, for instance, [http://www.bartleby.com/65/tr/Trotsky.html "Leon Trotsky"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314102048/http://www.bartleby.com/65/tr/Trotsky.html |date=14 March 2009}}, ''The Columbia Encyclopedia''</ref> This became his primary revolutionary pseudonym. After escape from Siberia, Trotsky moved to London, joining [[Georgi Plekhanov]], Vladimir Lenin, [[Julius Martov]], and other editors of ''Iskra''. Under the pen name ''Pero'' ("quill" or "pen"), Trotsky soon became one of the paper's leading writers.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|pp=6–7}}
[[File:Лев Троцкий после побега из первой ссылки (ок. 1902).jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Trotsky in 1902]]

Unknown to Trotsky, the six editors of ''Iskra'' were evenly split between the "old guard" led by Plekhanov and the "new guard" led by Lenin and Martov. Plekhanov's supporters were older, and had spent the previous 20 years together in exile in Europe. Members of the new guard were in their early 30s and only recently emigrated from Russia. Lenin, who was trying to establish a permanent majority against Plekhanov within ''Iskra,'' expected Trotsky, then 23, to side with the new guard. In March 1903 Lenin wrote:
{{Blockquote|I suggest to all the members of the editorial board that they co-opt 'Pero' as a member of the board on the same basis as other members. [...] We very much need a seventh member, both as a convenience in voting (six being an even number) and as an addition to our forces. 'Pero' has been contributing to every issue for several months now; he works, in general, most energetically for the Iskra; he gives lectures (in which he has been very successful). In the section of articles and notes on the events of the day, he will not only be very useful, but absolutely necessary. Unquestionably a man of rare abilities, he has conviction and energy, and he will go much farther.<ref>Quoted in chapter XII of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch12.htm 'My Life'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121230553/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch12.htm |date=21 November 2005}}, Marxist Internet Archive</ref>}} Because of Plekhanov's opposition, Trotsky did not become a full member of the board. But participated in its meetings in an advisory capacity, which earned him Plekhanov's enmity.

In late 1902, Trotsky met [[Natalia Sedova]] (1882–1962), who soon became his companion. They married in 1903, and she was with him until his death. They had two children together, [[Lev Sedov]] (1906–1938) and [[Sergei Sedov]] (1908–1937), both of whom would predecease their parents. Regarding his sons' surnames, Trotsky later explained that after the 1917 revolution:
{{Blockquote|In order not to oblige my sons to change their name, I, for "citizenship" requirements, took on the name of my wife.<ref>Trotsky's [http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6735/673549.html 'Thermidor and anti-Semitism' (1937)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129055537/http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6735/673549.html |date=29 November 2005}}</ref>}}

Trotsky never used the name "Sedov" either privately or publicly. Natalia Sedova sometimes signed her name "Sedova-Trotskaya".

=== Split with Lenin (1903–1904) ===
In the meantime, after a period of secret police repression and internal confusion that followed the [[1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] in 1898, ''Iskra'' succeeded in convening the party's [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Second Congress]] in London in August 1903. Trotsky and other ''Iskra'' editors attended. The first congress went as planned, with ''Iskra'' supporters handily defeating the few "economist" delegates. Then the congress discussed the position of the [[Jewish Bund]], which had co-founded the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) in 1898 but wanted to remain autonomous within the party.<ref name=":3">Trotsky, Leon.&nbsp;''My life: an attempt at an autobiography''. Courier Corporation, 2007.</ref>

Shortly afterwards, the pro-Iskra delegates unexpectedly split into two factions. The split was initially over an organisational issue. Lenin and his supporters, the Bolsheviks, argued for a smaller but highly organized party where only party members would be seen as members, while Martov and his supporters, the [[Mensheviks]], argued for a bigger and less disciplined party where people who assisted would also be seen as members. In a surprise development, Trotsky and most of the Iskra editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks, while Plekhanov supported Lenin and the [[Bolsheviks]]. During 1903 and 1904, many members changed sides in the factions. Trotsky left the Mensheviks in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cavendish|first=Richard|year=2003|title=The Bolshevik–Menshevik Split|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/bolshevik-menshevik-split|journal=History Today|volume=53|number=11|access-date=22 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022175007/http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/bolshevik-menshevik-split|archive-date=22 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

From 1904 until 1917, Trotsky described himself as a "non-factional social democrat". He tried to reconcile different groups within the party, which resulted in many clashes with Lenin and other prominent party members. Trotsky later maintained that he had been wrong in opposing Lenin on the issue of the party. Trotsky began developing his theory of [[permanent revolution]] and developed a close working relationship with [[Alexander Parvus]] in 1904–07.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8497.1975.tb01151.x|title=Parvus, Luxemburg and Kautsky on the 1905 Russian Revolution: The Relationship with Trotsky|last=Weber|first=Nicholas|date=1975|journal=Australian Journal of Politics and History|volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=39–53 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8497.1975.tb01151.x  |issn=0004-9522}}</ref> During their split, Lenin referred to Trotsky as "Little Judas" (''Iudushka'', based on the character from [[Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin]]'s novel ''[[The Golovlyov Family]]''),<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1911/jan/02.htm Lenin: "Judas Trotsky's Blush of Shame"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703011452/http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1911/jan/02.htm |date=3 July 2013}}, Marxists Internet Archive; retrieved 26 July 2013.</ref><ref>Goryachkina, [http://feb-web.ru/feb/irl/il0/il9/il9-159-.htm?cmd=2 М.S.

=== 1905 revolution and trial (1905–1906) ===
The unrest and agitation against the Russian government came to a head in [[Saint Petersburg]] on 3 January 1905 ([[Julian Calendar]]), when a strike broke out at the [[Putilov Works]] in the city. This single strike grew into a general strike, and by 7 January 1905, there were 140,000 strikers in Saint Petersburg.{{sfn|Trotsky|1971|p=73}}

On Sunday, 9 January 1905, Father [[Georgi Gapon]] knowingly led a procession of radicals mixed within larger groups of ordinary working citizens through the streets to the [[Winter Palace]] to supposedly beseech the Tsar for food and relief from the government. According to Gapon himself, he led the people into a Palace Guard already on the defensive due to the crowd instigating violence against them. They eventually fired on the demonstration, resulting in the deaths of an unknown number of violent radicals, peaceful demonstrators and police caught within the melee. Although Sunday, 9 January 1905, became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], Gapon's own biography points to a conspiracy. This was later confirmed by Russian police records listing the number of known militant radicals found among the dead.<ref>Gapon, Georgy. ''The Story of My Life''. Chapman & Hall; 1st THUS edition (January 1, 1905)</ref><ref>Smith, Edward Ellis. The Okhrana; The Russian Department of Police; A Bibliography. Hoover Institution, Stanford University, 1967.</ref>

[[File:Leon Trotsky Mugshot.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Police mugshots of Trotsky in 1905 after Soviet members were arrested during a meeting in the Free Economic Society building]]

Following the events of Bloody Sunday, Trotsky secretly returned to Russia in February 1905, by way of [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=117}} At first he wrote leaflets for an underground printing press in Kiev, but soon moved to the capital, Saint Petersburg. There he worked with both Bolsheviks, such as [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] member [[Leonid Krasin]], and the local Menshevik committee, which he pushed in a more radical direction. The latter, however, were betrayed by a secret police agent in May, and Trotsky had to flee to rural [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]]. There he worked on fleshing out his theory of permanent revolution.<ref>{{cite book | author = Leon Trotsky | title = Permanent Revolution | chapter = Results and Prospects | publisher = Pathfinder Press | location = New York | year = 1969 | orig-year = 1929 | pages = 27, 122}}</ref>

On 19 September 1905, the typesetters at the [[Ivan Sytin]]'s printing house in Moscow went out on strike for shorter hours and higher pay. By the evening of 24 September, the workers at 50 other printing shops in Moscow were also on strike. On 2 October 1905, the typesetters in printing shops in Saint Petersburg decided to strike in support of the Moscow strikers. On 7 October 1905, the railway workers of the [[Moscow–Kazan Railway]] went out on strike.{{sfn|Trotsky|1971|pp=85–88}} Amid the resulting confusion, Trotsky returned from Finland to Saint Petersburg on 15 October 1905. On that day, Trotsky spoke before the Saint Petersburg Soviet Council of Workers Deputies, which was meeting at the Technological Institute in the city. Also attending were some 200,000 people crowded outside to hear the speeches—about half of all workers in Saint Petersburg.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=126}}

[[File:TrotskiEnLaFortalezaDePedroYPabloEn1906.png|thumb|upright=.8|Trotsky in prison, awaiting trial, 1906]]
After his return, Trotsky and [[Parvus]] took over the newspaper ''Russian Gazette,'' increasing its circulation to 500,000. Trotsky also co-founded, together with Parvus and Julius Martov and other Mensheviks, "Nachalo" ("The Beginning"), which also proved to be a very successful newspaper in the revolutionary atmosphere of Saint Petersburg in 1905.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|pp=138–139}}

Just before Trotsky's return, the Mensheviks had independently come up with the same idea that Trotsky had: an elected non-party revolutionary organization representing the capital's workers, the first [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] ("Council") of Workers. By the time of Trotsky's arrival, the [[Saint Petersburg Soviet]] was already functioning, headed by [[Georgy Stepanovich Khrustalev-Nosar|Khrustalyev-Nosar]] (Georgy Nosar, alias Pyotr Khrustalyov). Khrustalyev-Nosar had been a compromise figure when elected as the head of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. He was a lawyer that stood above the political factions contained in the Soviet.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=131}}

However, since his election, he proved to be very popular with the workers in spite of the Bolsheviks' original opposition to him. Khrustalev-Nosar became famous in his position as spokesman for the Saint Petersburg Soviet.{{sfn|Trotsky|1971|p=218}} Indeed, to the outside world, Khrustalev-Nosar was the embodiment of the Saint Petersburg Soviet.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=131}} Trotsky joined the Soviet under the name "Yanovsky" (after the village he was born in, Yanovka) and was elected vice-chairman. He did much of the actual work at the Soviet and, after Khrustalev-Nosar's arrest on 26 November 1905, was elected its chairman. On 2 December, the Soviet issued a proclamation which included the following statement about the Tsarist government and its foreign debts:<ref>Quoted in Chapter XIV of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch14.htm ''My Life''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414150502/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch14.htm |date=14 April 2006}}</ref> {{Blockquote|The autocracy never enjoyed the confidence of the people and was never granted any authority by the people. We have therefore decided not to allow the repayment of such loans as have been made by the Tsarist government when openly engaged in a war with the entire people.}}

The following day, on 3 December 1905, the Soviet was surrounded by troops loyal to the government and the deputies were arrested.{{sfn|Trotsky|1971|pp=231–233}} Trotsky and other Soviet leaders were tried in 1906 on charges of supporting an armed rebellion. On 4 October 1906 he was convicted and sentenced to internal exile to Siberia.

=== Second emigration (1907–1914) ===
[[File:ParvusTrotskiDeich.jpg|thumb|Trotsky with [[Alexander Parvus]] (left) and [[Leo Deutsch]] (right) in Saint Peter and Paul Fortress prison at Saint Petersburg in 1906]]

While en route to exile in [[Obdorsk]], Siberia, in January 1907, Trotsky escaped at [[Beryozovo, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug|Berezov]]<ref>Chapter XXIII of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch17.htm ''1905''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305033203/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch17.htm |date=5 March 2006}}</ref> and once again made his way to London. He attended the [[5th Congress of the RSDLP]]. In October, he moved to [[Vienna]], Austria-Hungary. For the next seven years, he often took part in the activities of the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]] and, occasionally, of the [[German Social Democratic Party]].<ref name=":3" />

In Vienna, Trotsky became close to [[Adolph Joffe]], his friend for the next 20 years, who introduced him to [[psychoanalysis]].<ref>Chapter XVII of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch17.htm ''My Life''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305033203/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch17.htm |date=5 March 2006}}, Marxist Internet Archive; retrieved 31 January 2018. {{ISBN?}}</ref>

[[File:Троцкий читает газету „Правда“ в Вене (ок. 1910).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.7|Trotsky reading ''Pravda'' in Vienna, circa 1910]]
In October 1908 he was asked to join the editorial staff of ''[[Pravda]]'' ("Truth"), a bi-weekly, Russian-language social democratic paper for Russian workers, which he co-edited with Adolph Joffe and [[Matvey Skobelev]]. It was smuggled into Russia.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=191}} The paper appeared very irregularly; only five issues were published in its first year.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=191}}

Avoiding factional politics, the paper proved popular with Russian industrial workers. Both the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks split multiple times after the failure of the 1905–1907 revolution. Money was very scarce for the publication of ''Pravda''. Trotsky approached the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Central Committee]] to seek financial backing for the newspaper throughout 1909.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=192}}

A majority of Bolsheviks controlled the Central Committee in 1910. Lenin agreed to the financing of "Pravda", but required a Bolshevik to be appointed as co-editor of the paper.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|p=192}} When various Bolshevik and Menshevik factions tried to re-unite at the January 1910 RSDLP Central Committee meeting in Paris over Lenin's objections,<ref>{{cite web | title = Towards Unity | author = V.

Lev Kamenev, Trotsky's brother-in-law, was added to the editorial board from the Bolsheviks, but the unification attempts failed in August 1910. Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations. Trotsky continued publishing ''Pravda'' for another two years until it finally folded in April 1912.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|loc=Chapter 1}}

The Bolsheviks started a new workers-oriented newspaper in Saint Petersburg on 22 April 1912 and also called it ''Pravda''. Trotsky was so upset by what he saw as a usurpation of his newspaper's name that in April 1913, he wrote a letter to [[Nikolay Chkheidze]], a Menshevik leader, bitterly denouncing Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Though he quickly got over the disagreement, the message was intercepted by the [[Okhrana|Russian secret police]], and a copy was put into their archives. Shortly after Lenin's death in 1924, the letter was found and publicized by Trotsky's opponents within the Communist Party to portray him as Lenin's enemy.{{sfn|Deutscher|2003a|pp=6–7}}

The 1910s were a period of heightened tension within the RSDLP, leading to numerous frictions between Trotsky, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. The most serious disagreement that Trotsky and the Mensheviks had with Lenin at the time was over the issue of "expropriations",<ref>Chapter XVI of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch16.htm ''My Life''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420211850/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch16.htm |date=20 April 2006}}</ref> i.e., armed robbery of banks and other companies by Bolshevik groups to procure money for the Party. These actions had been banned by the 5th Congress, but were continued by the Bolsheviks.

[[File:Trotsky in Vienna.jpg|thumb|left|Trotsky in Vienna]]
In January 1912, the majority of the Bolshevik faction, led by Lenin, as well as a few defecting Mensheviks, held a conference in [[Prague]] and decided to break away from the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], and formed a new party, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks)]]. In response, Trotsky organized a "unification" conference of social democratic factions in Vienna in August 1912 (a.k.a. "The August Bloc") and tried to re-unite the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks into one party. The attempt was generally unsuccessful.<ref name=":3" />

In Vienna, Trotsky continuously published articles in radical Russian and Ukrainian newspapers, such as ''Kievskaya Mysl,'' under a variety of pseudonyms, often using "Antid Oto", a name chosen at random from an Italian dictionary, with Trotsky joking that "wanted to inject the Marxist antidote into the legitimate newspapers".{{sfn|Service|2010|p=62}}<ref>{{cite web | title = My Life, Chapter IX | author = L. Trotsky | url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/mylife/ch09.htm | website = Marxists Internet Archive}}</ref> In September 1912, ''Kievskaya Mysl'' sent him to the Balkans as its war correspondent, where he covered the two [[Balkan Wars]] for the next year.

On 3 August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, in which [[Austria-Hungary]] fought against the Russian Empire, Trotsky was forced to flee Vienna for neutral Switzerland to avoid arrest as a Russian [[émigré]].<ref name=":4" />

=== World War I (1914–1917) ===
The outbreak of World War I caused a sudden realignment within the RSDLP and other European social democratic parties over the issues of war, revolution, pacifism and internationalism, redividing the party into defeatists and defencists. Within the RSDLP, Lenin, Trotsky and Martov advocated various internationalist anti-war positions that saw defeat for your own country's ruling class imperialists as the "lesser evil" in the war, while they opposed all imperialists in the imperialist war. These anti-war believers were known as "defeatists". Those who supported one side over the other in the war were known as "defencists". Plekhanov and many other defencist social democrats (both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks) supported the Russian government to some extent and wanted them to win the war, while Trotsky's ex-colleague Parvus, now a defencist, sided against Russia so strongly that he wanted Germany to win the war. In Switzerland, Trotsky briefly worked within the [[Swiss Socialist Party]], prompting it to adopt an internationalist resolution. He wrote a book opposing the war, ''The War and the International,''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1914-war/index.htm |title=Marxists.org, ''The War and the International'' |access-date=31 August 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120092354/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1914-war/index.htm |archive-date=20 November 2005 |url-status=live}}</ref> and the pro-war position taken by the European social democratic parties, primarily the German party.

[[File:Trotskynina1915.jpg|thumb|upright|Leon Trotsky with his daughter Nina in 1915]]

As a war correspondent for the ''Kievskaya Mysl'', Trotsky moved to France on 19 November 1914. In January 1915 in Paris, he began editing (at first with Martov, who soon resigned as the paper moved to the left) ''[[Nashe Slovo]]'' ("Our Word"), an internationalist socialist newspaper. He adopted the slogan of "peace without indemnities or annexations, peace without conquerors or conquered." Lenin advocated Russia's defeat in the war and demanded a complete break with the [[Second International]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life of Lenin|last=Fischer|first=Louis|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson History|year=2001|isbn=978-1-84212-230-3|location=UK}}</ref>

Trotsky attended the [[Zimmerwald Conference]] of anti-war socialists in September 1915 and advocated a middle course between those who, like Martov, would stay within the Second International at any cost and those who, like Lenin, would break with the Second International and form a [[Third International]]. The conference adopted the middle line proposed by Trotsky. At first opposed, in the end Lenin voted for Trotsky's resolution to avoid a split among anti-war socialists.<ref>Gus Fagan.

In September 1916,{{sfn|Rubenstein|2011|p=75}} Trotsky was deported from France to Spain for his anti-war activities. Spanish authorities did not want him and deported him to the United States on 25 December 1916. He arrived in New York City on 13 January 1917. He stayed for over two months at 1522 Vyse Avenue in [[The Bronx]]. In New York he wrote articles for the local [[Russian language]] socialist newspaper, ''[[Novy Mir (1916 magazine)|Novy Mir]],'' and the Yiddish-language daily, [[The Jewish Daily Forward|''Der Forverts'']] ("Forward"), in translation. He also made speeches to Russian émigrés.<ref name=":5" />

Trotsky was living in New York City when the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 led to the abdication of [[Tsar Nicholas II]]. He left New York on 27 March 1917, but his ship, the ''[[SS Kristianiafjord]],'' was intercepted by [[Royal Navy|British naval]] officials in Canada at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. He was detained for a month at [[Amherst Internment Camp]] in [[Nova Scotia]]. While imprisoned in the camp, Trotsky established an increasing friendship with the workers and sailors amongst his fellow inmates, describing his month at the camp as "one continual mass meeting".<ref name="ns1758.ca">[http://ns1758.ca/quote/trotsky1917.html ''Leon Trotsky: My Life – In a Concentration Camp''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508001344/http://ns1758.ca/quote/trotsky1917.html |date=8 May 2015}}, ns1758.ca; accessed 31 January 2018.</ref>

Trotsky's speeches and agitation incurred the wrath of German officer inmates who complained to the British camp commander, Colonel Morris, about Trotsky's "anti-patriotic" attitude.<ref name="ns1758.ca" /> Morris then forbade Trotsky to make any more public speeches, leading to 530 prisoners protesting and signing a petition against Morris' order.<ref name="ns1758.ca" /> Back in Russia, after initial hesitation and facing pressure from the workers' and peasants' Soviets, the Russian foreign minister [[Pavel Milyukov]] was compelled to demand the release of Trotsky as a Russian citizen, and the British government freed him on 29 April 1917.<ref name="ns1758.ca" />

[[File:Leo Trotzki 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Trotsky arriving in Petrograd by train in May 1917]]
He reached Russia on 17 May 1917. After his return, Trotsky substantially agreed with the Bolshevik position, but did not join them right away. Russian social democrats were split into at least six groups, and the Bolsheviks were waiting for the next party Congress to determine which factions to merge with. Trotsky temporarily joined the [[Mezhraiontsy]], a regional social democratic organization in [[Petrograd]], and became one of its leaders. At the First [[Congress of Soviets]] in June, he was elected a member of the first [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] ("VTsIK") from the Mezhraiontsy faction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leon Trotsky {{!}} Biography, Books, Assassination, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leon-Trotsky|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=26 May 2020}}</ref>

After an unsuccessful pro-Bolshevik uprising in Petrograd, Trotsky was arrested on 7 August 1917. He was released 40 days later in the aftermath of the failed counter-revolutionary [[Kornilov Affair|uprising by Lavr Kornilov]].

Trotsky sided with Lenin against [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and Lev Kamenev when the Bolshevik Central Committee discussed staging an armed uprising, and he led the efforts to overthrow the [[Russian Provisional Government]] headed by socialist [[Aleksandr Kerensky]].

{{Blockquote|All practical work in connection with the organization of the uprising was done under the immediate direction of Comrade Trotsky, the President of the Petrograd Soviet.

After the success of the [[October Revolution]] on 7–8 November 1917, Trotsky led the efforts to repel a [[Kerensky-Krasnov uprising|counter-attack]] by [[Cossacks]] under General [[Pyotr Krasnov]] and other troops still loyal to the overthrown Provisional Government at [[Gatchina]]. Allied with Lenin, he defeated attempts by other Bolshevik Central Committee members (Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov, etc.) to share power with other  moderate, socialist parties. 
Trotsky was an outspoken advocate for a predominantly Bolshevik government and was reluctant to recall Mensheviks as partners after their voluntary withdrawal from the Congress of the Soviets. However, he released several socialist ministers from prison, and neither Trotsky nor his colleagues in 1917 wished to suppress these parties. The Bolsheviks also reserved a number of vacant seats in the Soviets and [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee|Central Executive]] for the parties in proportion to their vote share at the Congress.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=Isaac |title=The Prophet Armed Trotsky 1879-1921 (1954) |date=1954 |publisher=Oxford University Press. |pages=330–336 |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.507702/page/335/mode/1up?view=theater}}</ref>

At the same time, a number of prominent members of the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]] had assumed positions in Lenin's government and lead commissariats in several areas. This included agriculture ([[Andrei Kolegayev|Kolegaev]]), property ([[Vladimir Karelin|Karelin]]), justice ([[Isaac Steinberg|Steinberg]]), post offices and telegraphs ([[Prosh Proshian|Proshian]]) and local government (Trutovsky).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Abramovitch |first1=Raphael R. |title=The Soviet Revolution, 1917-1939 |date=1985 |publisher=International Universities Press |page=130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_q1WAmv7XkC&q=Steinberg+became+the+People%27s+Commissar+of+Justice,+Proshyan+became+the+People%27s+Commissar+for+Posts+and+Telegraphs |language=en}}</ref>

According to Deutscher, the Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries presented a number of demands for a coalition government. These demands proposed disarming the Bolshevik detachments and excluding Lenin and Trotsky from the coalition. This was seen as unacceptable to even the most moderate, Bolshevik negotiators such as Kamenev and Sokolnikov.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=Isaac |title=The Prophet Armed Trotsky 1879-1921 (1954) |date=1954 |publisher=Oxford University Press. |page=331 |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.507702/page/330/mode/1up?view=theater}}</ref>

By the end of 1917, Trotsky was unquestionably the second man in the Bolshevik Party after Lenin. He overshadowed Zinoviev, who had been Lenin's top lieutenant over the previous decade.

=== Commissar for Foreign Affairs and Brest-Litovsk (1917–1918) ===

The [[Tauride Palace]] is locked and guarded by Trotsky, [[Sverdlov]], [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]], and [[Mikhail Lashevich|Lashevich]].]]

After the Bolsheviks came to power, Trotsky became the [[People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs]] and published the [[secret treaties]] previously signed by the [[Triple Entente]] that detailed plans for post-war reallocation of colonies and redrawing state borders. On 23 November 1917, Trotsky revealed the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement|secret treaty arrangements]] which had been made between the Tsarist government, Britain and France, causing them considerable embarrassment.

==== Brest-Litovsk ====

[[File:Leon Trotsky Lev Kamenev Brest-Litovsk negotiations.jpg|thumb|Trotsky and [[Lev Kamenev]] at the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk negotiations]] (c. 1917–1918)]]
In preparation for peace talks with the representatives of the Imperial German government and the representatives of the other Central Powers leading up to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], Leon Trotsky appointed his old friend Joffe to represent the Bolsheviks. When the Soviet delegation learned that Germans and Austro-Hungarians planned to annex slices of Polish territory and to set up a rump Polish state with what remained, while the Baltic provinces were to become client states ruled by German princes, the talks were recessed for 12 days.

The Soviets' only hopes were that, given time, their allies would agree to join the negotiations or that the western European proletariat would revolt, so their best strategy was to prolong the negotiations. As Foreign Minister Leon Trotsky wrote, "To delay negotiations, there must be someone to do the delaying".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trotsky|first1=Leon|title=My Life|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/mylife/1930-lif.pdf|website=Marxists|publisher=Charles Schribner's Sons|page=286|date=1930}}</ref> Therefore, Trotsky replaced Joffe as the leader of the Soviet delegation during the peace negotiations in [[Brest-Litovsk]] from 22 December 1917 to 10 February 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/treaties-of-Brest-Litovsk|title=Treaties of Brest-Litovsk|website=[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]|date=2 February 2024 }}</ref> At that time the Soviet government was split on the issue.

They cited the successes of the newly formed (15 January 1918) voluntary [[Red Army]] against [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] forces of Gen. [[Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki]] in Belarus, [[White movement|White]] forces in the [[Don River, Russia|Don]] region, and newly independent [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian]] forces as proof that the Red Army could repel German forces, especially if propaganda and [[asymmetrical warfare]] were used.<ref name="Leon Trotsky" />

They were willing to hold talks with the Germans as a means of exposing German imperial ambitions (territorial gains, [[War reparations|reparations]], etc.) in the hope of accelerating the hoped−for Soviet revolution in the West. Still, they were dead set against signing any peace treaty. In the case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism. This opinion was shared by [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], who were then the Bolsheviks' junior partners in a coalition government.<ref name="lsrm" />

Lenin, who had earlier hoped for a speedy Soviet revolution in Germany and other parts of Europe, quickly decided that the Imperial government of Germany was still firmly in control and that, without a strong Russian military, an armed conflict with Germany would lead to a collapse of the Soviet government in Russia. He agreed with the Left Communists that ultimately a pan-European Soviet revolution would solve all problems, but until then the Bolsheviks had to stay in power. Lenin did not mind prolonging the negotiating process for maximum propaganda effect, but, from January 1918 on, advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a German ultimatum. Trotsky's position was between these two Bolshevik factions. Like Lenin, he admitted that the old Russian military, inherited from the monarchy and the Provisional Government and in advanced stages of decomposition, was unable to fight:<ref>The "Brest-Litovsk" chapter in Trotsky's 1925 book [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm ''Lenin''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125145958/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm |date=25 November 2005}}, marxists.org; Retrieved 1 June 2018.</ref>{{Blockquote|That we could no longer fight was perfectly clear to me and that the newly formed [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guard]] and Red Army detachments were too small and poorly trained to resist the Germans.}}

But he agreed with the Left Communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible morale and material blow to the Soviet government, negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918, resurrect the notion that the Bolsheviks secretly allied with the German government, and cause an upsurge of internal resistance. He argued that any German ultimatum should be refused, and that this might well lead to an uprising in Germany, or at least inspire German soldiers to disobey their officers since any German offensive would be a naked land grab for territories. Trotsky wrote in 1925:<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm ''Lenin''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125145958/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm |date=25 November 2005}}, marxists.org; Retrieved 31 January 2018.</ref>

Trotsky, in a letter he wrote to Lenin during the negotiations, which must have been written before January 18, 1918, described its policy, summarily, as follows:<ref>{{cite journal |title=Letters From Trotzky and From Kerensky's War Minister |journal=[[Current History]] |date=1918 |volume=VIII |issue=Second part |page=113 |url=https://archive.org/details/currenthistoryfo08newyuoft/page/113/ |access-date=10 April 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Magnes |first1=Judah Leon |author1-link=Judah Leon Magnes |title=Russia and Germany at Brest-Litovsk: A Documentary History of the Peace Negotiations |date=1919 |publisher=[[Rand School of Social Science]] |pages=122–123 |edition=1st |url=https://archive.org/details/russiagermanyatb00magnrich/page/122/ |access-date=10 April 2023}}</ref><ref>For a time it was speculated that this letter was in fact not an authentic one.

However, even though Lenin was in favor of a peace, due to party opposition, he responded with these messages from January 18, 1918:<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Meijer |editor1-first=Jan M. |title=The Trotsky Papers, 1917–1922 |date=1964 |publisher=Mouton & Co. |location=The Hague|pages=6–7}}</ref> "Stalin has just arrived; we will look into the matter with him and let you have a joint answer right away," and "please adjourn proceedings and leave for Petrograd.

As it was remarked by Trotsky that, "[... p]ossibly this answer already showed that he did not agree with my proposition (...)", Trotsky returned to Petrograd to debate with Lenin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotzky |first1=Leon |title=Lenin |date=1925 |publisher=Blue Ribbon Books Inc. |location=New York |page=107 |url=https://archive.org/details/lenin00trot/ |access-date=10 April 2023}}</ref> During his debate with Trotsky, Lenin concluded: "(...)

However, after debates with the German delegation, Trotsky and the Russian delegation withdrew from peace talks on 10 February 1918, by declaring ending the war on the side of Soviet Russia, and not signing a peace treaty.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Trotsky |first1=L. |title=Statement By Trotsky At The Brest-Litovsk Peace Conference On Russia's Withdrawal From The War |url=https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/foreign-relations/1917-1918/1918/February/10a.htm |website=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |access-date=10 April 2023}}</ref> Privately, in correspondence with [[Count Otto von Czernin]], Trotsky had expressed his willigness to relent to peace terms upon the resumption of a German offensive although with moral dissent.{{sfn|Deutscher|2015a|pp=389}} Contrary to Russia's declaration, Germany resumed [[Operation Faustschlag|military operations]] on 18 February. Within a day, it became clear that the German army was capable of conducting offensive operations and that Red Army detachments, which were relatively small, poorly organized, and poorly led, were no match for it. On the evening of 18 February 1918, Trotsky and his supporters in the committee abstained, and Lenin's proposal was accepted 7–4. The Soviet government sent a [[Radiogram (message)|radiogram to]] the German side, taking the final Brest-Litovsk peace terms.<ref name="Felshtinsky">{{cite book | first = Yuri | last = Felshtinsky | title = Lenin and His Comrades: The Bolsheviks Take Over Russia 1917–1924 | publisher = Enigma Books | location = New York | isbn =978-1-929631-95-7 | date = 26 October 2010}}</ref>

Germany did not respond for three days and continued its offensive, encountering little resistance. The response arrived on 21 February, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government had no choice but to fight. But in the end, the committee again voted 7–4 on 23 February 1918; the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed on 3 March and ratified on 15 March 1918. Since Trotsky was so closely associated with the policy previously followed by the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, he resigned from his position as Commissar for Foreign Affairs to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy.

=== Head of the Red Army (spring 1918) ===
[[File:Leon Trotsky Armored Train 1920.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|Trotsky speaks from [[Trotsky's train|his armoured train]] during the civil war in 1920]]

On 13 March 1918, Trotsky's resignation as Commissar for Foreign Affairs was officially accepted, and he was appointed People's Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs—in place of Podvoisky—and chairman of the Supreme Military Council. The post of commander-in-chief was abolished, and Trotsky gained full control of the Red Army, responsible only to the Communist Party leadership, whose Left Socialist Revolutionary allies had left the government over the controversial treaty of Brest-Litovsk.<ref name="lsrm">[https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#left-srs Left Socialist-Revolutionaries (Left SRs)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716012705/https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#left-srs#left-srs |date=16 July 2018}}; Glossary of organizations on [[Marxists.org]]</ref>

The entire Bolshevik leadership of the Red Army, including People's Commissar (defence minister) [[Nikolai Podvoisky]] and commander-in-chief [[Nikolai Krylenko]], protested vigorously against Trotsky's appointment and eventually resigned. They believed that the Red Army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries, rely on propaganda and force, and have elected officers. They viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military, much less put in charge of it. Their views continued to be popular with many Bolsheviks throughout most of the [[Russian Civil War]], and their supporters, including Podvoisky, who became one of Trotsky's deputies, were a constant thorn in Trotsky's side. The discontent with Trotsky's policies of strict discipline, forced [[conscription]] and reliance on carefully supervised non-Communist military experts eventually led to the [[Military Opposition]], which was active within the Communist Party in late 1918–1919.<ref name="Life XXXVI">{{cite book|title=My Life|last=Trotsky|first=Leon|chapter=XXXVI|year=1930|chapter-url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/mylife/ch36.htm|title-link=My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)}}</ref>

The military situation soon tested Trotsky's managerial and organization-building skills. In May–June 1918, the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] ''en route'' from European Russia to [[Vladivostok]] rose against the Soviet government. This left the Bolsheviks with the loss of most of the country's territory, an increasingly well-organized resistance by Russian anti-Communist forces (usually referred to as the [[White Movement|White Army]] after their best-known component) and widespread defection by the military experts whom Trotsky relied on.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=J.F.L|date=1963|title=The Czechoslovak Revolt against the Bolsheviks|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/149174|journal=Soviet Studies|volume=15|issue=2|pages=124–151|doi=10.1080/09668136308410353|jstor=149174}}</ref>

Trotsky and the government responded with a full-fledged [[mobilization]], which increased the size of the Red Army from fewer than 300,000 in May 1918 to one million in October, and an introduction of [[political commissar]]s into the army. The latter had the task of ensuring the loyalty of military experts (mostly former officers in the Imperial Army) and co-signing their orders. Trotsky regarded the organisation of the Red Army as built on the ideas of the October Revolution. As he later wrote in his autobiography:<ref>Chapter XXXIV of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch34.htm ''My Life''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420212103/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch34.htm |date=20 April 2006}}, marxists.org; accessed 31 January 2018.</ref>

Another controversial feature of his military decisions was to inaugurate hostage-taking of relatives of ex-Tsarist officials working in the Red Army to avert the risk of [[defection]] or betrayal.{{sfn|Kort|2015|p=130}} Service pointed out that this practice was exercised by both Red and White armies during the Civil War.{{sfn|Service|2010|p=263}}

Trotsky would later defend his decision and argue that none of the families of ex-officials who did betray the army and contribute to additional human casualties were themselves ever executed. He would also insist that had these draconian measures been adopted rather than excess “magnanimity” to opponents at the start of the October Revolution then Russia would have experienced far less casualties.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rogovin |first1=Vadim Zakharovich |title=Stalin's Terror of 1937-1938: Political Genocide in the USSR |date=2009 |publisher=Mehring Books |isbn=978-1-893638-04-4 |page=376 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDiFNXLNPDEC&dq=trotsky+hostage+taking&pg=PA376 |language=en}}</ref> Deutscher draws attention to the fact that Trotsky preferred to exchange hostages and prisoners rather than execute them.

===== Desertions =====
In dealing with [[Desertion|deserters]], Trotsky appealed to them politically, arousing them with the ideas of the Revolution.
{{Blockquote|In...Kaluga, Voronezh, and Ryazan, tens of thousands of young peasants had failed to answer the first recruiting summons by the Soviets ... The war commissariat of Ryazan succeeded in gathering in some fifteen thousand of such deserters. While passing through Ryazan, I decided to take a look at them. Some of our men tried to dissuade me. "Something might happen," they warned me. But everything went off beautifully. The men were called out of their barracks. "Comrade-deserters—come to the meeting. Comrade Trotsky has come to speak to you." They ran out excited, boisterous, as curious as schoolboys. I had imagined them much worse, and they had imagined me as more terrible...The "comrade-deserters" were looking at me with such curiosity that it seemed as if their eyes would pop out of their heads. I...spoke to them for about an hour and a half. It was a most responsive audience. I tried to raise them in their own eyes; concluding, I asked them to lift their hands in token of their loyalty to the revolution. The new ideas infected them before my very eyes. They were genuinely enthusiastic...shouted at the tops of their voices. They would hardly let me go. I learned afterward, with some pride, that one of the best ways to educate them was to remind them: "What did you promise Comrade Trotsky?" Later on, regiments of Ryazan "deserters" fought well at the fronts.}}

The first use of the punitive [[barrier troops]] by the Red Army occurred in the summer and fall of 1918 in the [[Eastern Front (RSFSR)|Eastern front]] during the [[Russian Civil War]], when [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|People's Commissar of Military and Naval Affairs]] (War Commissar) Trotsky authorized [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], commander of the [[1st Army (RSFSR)|1st Army]], to station blocking detachments behind unreliable infantry regiments, with orders to shoot if front-line troops either deserted or retreated without permission. The barrier troops comprised personnel drawn from [[Cheka]] punitive detachments or regular infantry regiments.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1996|p=180}}

In December 1918, Trotsky ordered detachments of additional barrier troops be raised for attachment to each infantry formation. On December 18 he cabled: "How do things stand with the blocking units? As far as I am aware they have not been included in our establishment and it appears they have no personnel. It is absolutely essential that we have at least an embryonic network of blocking units and that we work out a procedure for bringing them up to strength and deploying them."{{sfn|Volkogonov|1996|p=180}} The barrier troops were also used to enforce Bolshevik control over food supplies in areas controlled by the army, a role which earned them the hatred of the civilian population.<ref>Lih, Lars T., ''Bread and Authority in Russia, 1914–1921'', University of California Press (1990), p. 131.</ref>

[[File:Demyan Bedny and Leon Trotsky.jpg|thumb|Trotsky with [[Demyan Bedny]] near Kazan, 1918]]
Given the lack of manpower and the 16 opposing foreign armies, Trotsky insisted on the use of former Tsarist officers as military specialists within the army, in combination with Bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the Red Army. Lenin commented on this:{{Blockquote|When Comrade Trotsky informed me recently that the number of officers of the old army employed by our War Department runs into several tens of thousands, I perceived concretely where the secret of using our enemy lay, how to compel those who had opposed communism to build it, how to build communism with the bricks which the capitalists had chosen to hurl against us! We have no other bricks! And so, we must compel the bourgeois experts, under the leadership of the proletariat, to build up our edifice with these bricks. This is what is difficult; but this is the pledge of victory.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/mar/x01.htm |title=Achievements and Difficulties of the Soviet Government |last1=Lenin |first1=Vladimir Ilych |date=1919 |website=marxists.org |publisher=Progress Publishers |access-date=6 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090910/https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/mar/x01.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}

[[File:Trotsky, Lenin, Kamenev (1919).jpg|thumb|Trotsky (left), with [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] (centre) and [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]] (right), in discussion during the Russian Civil War]]

In September 1918, the Bolshevik government, facing military difficulties, declared what amounted to martial law and reorganized the Red Army. The Supreme Military Council was abolished, and the position of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by the commander of the [[Latvian Riflemen]], [[Jukums Vācietis]], who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of the day-to-day operations. Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky's adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.

The reorganization caused yet another conflict, this time between Trotsky and Stalin, in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general [[Pavel Sytin|Pavel Pavlovich Sytin]] to command the Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him and so he was recalled from the front. Lenin and [[Yakov Sverdlov]] tried to make Trotsky and Stalin reconcile, but their meeting proved unsuccessful.

In 1919, 612 "hardcore" deserters of the total 837,000 draft dodgers and deserters were executed following Trotsky's dracionan measures.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reese |first1=Roger R. |title=Russia's Army: A History from the Napoleonic Wars to the War in Ukraine |date=3 October 2023 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0-8061-9356-4 |page=109 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWS2EAAAQBAJ&dq=trotsky+desertion+612&pg=PA109 |language=en}}</ref> According to [[Orlando Figes]], most "deserters...were handed back to the military authorities, and formed into units for transfer to one of the rear armies or directly to the front". Even those registered as "malicious" deserters were returned to the ranks when the demand for reinforcements became desperate". Forges noted that the Red Army instituted [[amnesty]] weeks to prohibit punitive measures against desertion which encouraged  the voluntary return of 98,000-132,000 deserters.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Figes |first1=Orlando |title=The Red Army and Mass Mobilization during the Russian Civil War 1918-1920 |journal=Past & Present |date=1990 |issue=129 |pages=168–211 |doi=10.1093/past/129.1.168 |jstor=650938 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/650938 |issn=0031-2746}}</ref>

==== 1919 ====
[[File:Trotsky con la guardia roja.jpg|thumb|Trotsky addressing soldiers during the Polish-Soviet War]]

Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, there were a number of attacks on Trotsky's leadership of the Red Army, including veiled accusations in newspaper articles inspired by Stalin and a direct attack by the Military Opposition at the [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|VIIIth Party Congress]] in March 1919. On the surface, he weathered them successfully and was elected one of only five full members of the first [[Politburo]] after the Congress. But he later wrote:<ref name="Life XXXVI" />{{Blockquote|It is no wonder that my military work created so many enemies for me. I did not look to the side, I elbowed away those who interfered with military success, or in the haste of the work trod on the toes of the unheeding and was too busy even to apologize. Some people remember such things. The dissatisfied and those whose feelings had been hurt found their way to Stalin or Zinoviev, for these two also nourished hurts.}}

In mid-1919, the dissatisfied had an opportunity to mount a serious challenge to Trotsky's leadership: the Red Army grew from 800,000 to 3,000,000 and fought simultaneously on sixteen fronts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/2010/03/trotsky-stalin-russian-lenin|title=Lost leaders: Leon Trotsky|work=The New Statesman|location=UK|access-date=22 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423073037/http://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/2010/03/trotsky-stalin-russian-lenin|archive-date=23 April 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the 3–4 July Central Committee meeting, after a heated exchange, the majority supported Kamenev and Smilga against Vācietis and Trotsky. Trotsky's plan was rejected, and he was much criticized for various alleged shortcomings in his leadership style, much of it of a personal nature. Stalin used this opportunity to pressure Lenin<ref name="My Life">Chapter XXXVII of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch37.htm ''My Life''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420212156/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch37.htm |date=20 April 2006}}</ref> to dismiss Trotsky from his post.

However, some significant changes to the leadership of the Red Army were made. Trotsky was temporarily sent to the Southern Front, while Smilga informally coordinated the work in Moscow. Most members of the Revolutionary Military Council who were not involved in its day-to-day operations were relieved of their duties on 8 July, and new members, including Smilga, were added. The same day, while Trotsky was in the south, Vācietis was suddenly arrested by the Cheka on suspicion of involvement in an anti-Soviet plot, and replaced by Sergey Kamenev. After a few weeks in the south, Trotsky returned to Moscow and resumed control of the Red Army. A year later, Smilga and [[Tukhachevsky]] were defeated during the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], but Trotsky refused this opportunity to pay Smilga back, which earned him Smilga's friendship and later his support during the intra-Party battles of the 1920s.<ref>Isai Abramovich's [http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/ABRAMOWICH/abramowich1.txt memoirs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226084149/http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/ABRAMOWICH/abramowich1.txt |date=26 February 2006}} re: the Smilga episode. Abramovich (1900–1985), a friend of Smilga's, was one of the few Trotskyists who survived the Great Purges and returned from Stalin's camps in the late 1950s.</ref>

By October 1919, the government was in the worst crisis of the Civil War: Denikin's troops approached [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and Moscow from the south, and General [[Nikolay Yudenich]]'s troops approached Petrograd from the west. Lenin decided that since it was more important to defend Moscow, Petrograd would have to be abandoned. Trotsky argued<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch35.htm ''My Life'' (Chapter XXXV)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420212115/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch35.htm |date=20 April 2006}}, marxists.org; accessed 31 January 2018.</ref> that Petrograd needed to be defended, at least in part to prevent [[Estonia]] and Finland from intervening. In a rare reversal, Trotsky was supported by Stalin and Zinoviev, and prevailed against Lenin in the Central Committee.

==== 1920 ====
With the defeat of Denikin and Yudenich in late 1919, the Soviet government's emphasis shifted to the economy. Trotsky spent the winter of 1919–20 in the Urals region trying to restart its economy. A false rumor of his assassination circulated in Germany and the international press on New Year's Day 1920.<ref>{{cite news |title=Assassinate Trotzky, Report; Ex-Leader Of Russia Soviet Slayer's Victim, Berlin Officials Hear |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=LAH19200101.2.179&e=--2019---2019--en--20-LAH-1--txt-txIN-Assassinate+Trotzky-------1 |access-date=24 May 2020 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Herald]] |date=1 January 1920 |page=1}}</ref> Based on his experiences, he proposed abandoning the policies of [[War Communism]],<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch38.htm ''My Life'' (Chapter XXXVIII)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210202136/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch38.htm |date=10 December 2005}}, marxists.org; accessed 31 January 2018.</ref> which included confiscating grain from peasants, and partially restoring the grain market. Still committed to War Communism, Lenin rejected his proposal.
[[File:Trotsky_on_a_Polish_poster_of_1920.jpg|thumb|Trotsky on an [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] Polish poster titled "Bolshevik freedom" which depicts him on a pile of skulls, holding a bloody knife, during the [[Polish–Soviet War]]]]
In early 1920, Soviet–Polish tensions eventually led to the [[Polish–Soviet War]]. In the run-up and during the war, Trotsky argued<ref name="My Life" /> that the Red Army was exhausted and the Soviet government should sign a peace treaty with Poland as soon as possible. He did not believe that the Red Army would find much support in Poland proper. Lenin later wrote that he and other Bolshevik leaders believed the Red Army's successes in the Russian Civil War and against the Poles meant "The defensive period of the war with worldwide imperialism was over, and we could, and had the obligation to, exploit the military situation to launch an offensive war."{{sfn|Pipes|1996|loc=Political Report of the Central Committee of the RKP(b) to the Ninth All-Russian Conference of the Communist Party delivered by Lenin on 20 September 1920, Document 59}}

Poland defeated the Red Army, and the offensive was turned back during the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] in August 1920. Back in Moscow, Trotsky again argued for a peace treaty, and this time prevailed.

=== Trade union debate (1920–1921) ===
{{main|Trade-union debate (Russia)}}
During the trade union debate of 1920–1921, Trotsky argued that trade unions should be integrated directly into the state apparatus, advocating for a "militarization of labor" to rebuild the Soviet economy after the Civil War. He believed that in a workers' state, the state should control the unions, with workers being treated as "soldiers of labor" under strict discipline.<ref>[[Tony Cliff]]; [https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1990/trotsky2/11-warcomm.html Trotsky: The Sword of the Revolution 1917–1923] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715195155/https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1990/trotsky2/11-warcomm.html |date=15 July 2018}}; Chapter 11: War Communism at an impasse; paragraph "The militarisation of all labour"; Bookmarks, London 1990.</ref>

This position was sharply criticized by [[Vladimir Lenin]], who argued that trade unions should retain some independence from the state and act as "schools of communism" rather than instruments of state control. Lenin's view won out at the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|10th Congress]] in 1921, and several of Trotsky’s supporters, including [[Nikolay Krestinsky]], lost their leadership positions.

=== Kronstadt rebellion ===
{{main|Kronstadt rebellion}}
[[File:Kronstadt attack.JPG|thumb|[[Red Army]] troops attack [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt sailors]] in March 1921.]]
In March 1921, during the Kronstadt Rebellion, sailors and soldiers in the naval base of [[Kronstadt]] rose up against the Bolshevik government, demanding greater freedom for workers and peasants, an end to one-party rule, and the restoration of civil rights.<ref>Kronstadt Rebellion, Kronstädter Aufstand In: Dictionary of Marxism, http://www.inkrit.de/e_inkritpedia/e_maincode/doku.php?id=k:kronstaedter_aufstand</ref> The rebellion occurred simultaneously with the 10th Party Congress, further destabilizing the fragile political situation.

Trotsky, as Commissar of War, was instrumental in ordering the suppression of the rebellion. On March 18, 1921, after several failed negotiations, the [[Red Army]] stormed the island, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Kronstadt sailors.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/07/kronstadt2.htm "More on the Suppression of Kronstadt"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121073115/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/07/kronstadt2.htm |date=21 November 2007}} by Leon Trotsky</ref> Trotsky justified the action by presenting evidence that the rebellion had foreign backing, though this claim has been contested by several historians.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Trotsky_Protests_Too_Much|title=Trotsky Protests Too Much|first=Emma|last=Goldman|publisher=The Anarchist Communist Federation|year=1939}}</ref> Trotsky’s role has been the subject of criticism, with anarchists such as [[Emma Goldman]] accusing him of betraying the revolution's democratic ideals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/pdfs/PublishedEssaysandPamphlets_TROTSKYPROTESTSTOOMUCH.pdf|first=Emma|last=Goldman|title=Trotsky Protests too Much|date=1938|publisher=The Anarchist Communist Federation|location=Glasgow|access-date=14 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118090914/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/pdfs/PublishedEssaysandPamphlets_TROTSKYPROTESTSTOOMUCH.pdf|archive-date=18 January 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Trotsky's contribution to the Russian Revolution ===
[[File:Leon Trotsky as the October Revolution Guard.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|Trotsky, the [[People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs]], as the Guard of the [[October Revolution]] on 14 May 1923]]

Vladimir Cherniaev, a leading Russian historian, sums up Trotsky's main contributions to the Russian Revolution:
{{Blockquote|Trotsky bears a great deal of responsibility both for the victory of the Red Army in the civil war, and for the establishment of a one-party authoritarian state with its apparatus for ruthlessly suppressing dissent... He was an ideologist and practitioner of the Red Terror. He despised "bourgeois democracy"; he believed that spinelessness and soft-heartedness would destroy the revolution, and that the suppression of the propertied classes and political opponents would clear the historical arena for socialism. He was the initiator of concentration camps, compulsory "labour camps", and the militarization of labour, and the state takeover of trade unions. Trotsky was implicated in many practices which would become standard in the Stalin era, including [[summary execution]]s.<ref name="auto2">V. I͡U.

Historian Geoffrey Swain argues that:
{{Blockquote|The Bolsheviks triumphed in the Civil War because of Trotsky's ability to work with military specialists, because of the style of work he introduced where widescale consultation was followed through by swift and determined action.{{sfn|Swain|2014a|p=210}}}}

Lenin said in 1921 that Trotsky was "in love with organisation," but in working politics, "he has not got a clue." Swain explains the paradox by arguing that Trotsky was not good at teamwork; he was a loner who had mostly worked as a journalist, not as a professional revolutionary like the others.{{sfn|Swain|2014a|p=211}}

=== Lenin's illness (1922–1923) ===
[[File:TrotskiEnMoscúConTropas1922 (cropped).jpeg|thumb|left|upright=.8|Trotsky with Red Army soldiers in Moscow, 1922]]
In late 1921, Lenin's health deteriorated and he was absent from Moscow for longer periods of time. He had three strokes between 25 May 1922 and 9 March 1923, which caused paralysis, loss of speech and finally death on 21 January 1924. With Lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922, Stalin was elevated to the newly created position of the Central Committee [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]].{{efn|Yakov Sverdlov was the Central Committee's senior secretary responsible for personnel affairs from 1917 and until his death in March 1919. He was replaced by [[Elena Stasova]], and in November 1919 by Nikolai Krestinsky.

After Krestinsky's ouster in March 1921, Vyacheslav Molotov became the senior secretary, but he lacked Krestinsky's authority, since he was not a full Politburo member. Stalin took over the position as senior secretary, which was formalized at the XIth Party Congress in April 1922, with Molotov becoming second secretary.}} Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev{{efn|It is not clear why Kamenev, a mild-mannered man with few leadership ambitions and who was the brother-in-law of Trotsky, sided with Zinoviev and Stalin against Trotsky in 1922. Trotsky later speculated that it may have been due to Kamenev's love of comfort, which Trotsky found "repelled me." He expressed [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1939/xx/kremlin.htm his feelings to Kamenev] in late 1920 or early 1921:{{Blockquote|Our relations with Kamenev, which were very good in the first period after the insurrection, began to become more distant from that day.}}}} became part of the ''[[wikt:troika|troika]]'' (triumvirate) formed by Stalin to ensure that Trotsky, publicly the number-two man in the country and Lenin's [[heir presumptive]], would not succeed Lenin.

The rest of the recently expanded Politburo (Rykov, [[Mikhail Tomsky]], Bukharin) was at first uncommitted, but eventually joined the ''troika.'' Stalin's power of patronage{{efn|The Central Committee's Secretariat became increasingly important during the Civil War and especially in its aftermath, as the Party switched from elected officials to appointed ones. The change was prompted by the need to allocate manpower quickly during the Civil War as well as by the transformation of the party from a small group of revolutionaries into the country's ruling party, with a corresponding increase in membership. New members included career seekers and former members of banned socialist parties, who were viewed with apprehension by Old Bolsheviks.

To prevent a possible degeneration of the party, various membership requirements were instituted for party officials, and the ultimate power of appointment of local officials was reserved for the Secretariat of the Central Committee. This put enormous power in the general secretary's hands.}} in his capacity as general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratisation of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted 'normality,' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.

Although the exact sequence of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the ''troika'' nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables).{{sfn|Pipes|1996|loc=Document 103 (22 May 1922)}} In mid-July 1922, Kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering Lenin to the effect that "(the Central Committee) is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard". Lenin was shocked and responded:{{sfn|Pipes|1996|loc=Document 106}}

{{Blockquote|Throwing Trotsky overboard—surely you are hinting at that, it is impossible to interpret it otherwise—is the height of stupidity. If you do not consider me already hopelessly foolish, how can you think of that????}}

From then until his final stroke, Lenin spent much of his time trying to devise a way to prevent a split within the Communist Party leadership, which was reflected in ''[[Lenin's Testament]].'' As part of this effort, on 11 September 1922 Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his deputy at the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Sovnarkom). The Politburo approved the proposal, but Trotsky "categorically refused". Lenin's proposal has been interpreted by various scholars as evidence that he designated Trotsky as a successor as head of government.{{sfn|Pipes|1996|loc=Document 109}}<ref name="Hitler and Stalin : parallel lives">{{cite book |last1=Bullock |first1=Alan |title=Hitler and Stalin: parallel lives |date=1991 |location=London |publisher= HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-00-215494-9 |page=163 |url=https://archive.org/details/hitlerstalinpara0000bull/page/132/mode/2up}}</ref>{{sfn|Mandel|1995|p=149}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ceplair |first1=Larry |title=Revolutionary Pairs: Marx and Engels, Lenin and Trotsky, Gandhi and Nehru, Mao and Zhou, Castro and Guevara |date=21 July 2020 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0-8131-7945-2 |page=93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pc3cDwAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref>{{sfn|Rubenstein|2011|p=127}}

In January 1923, Lenin amended his Testament to suggest that Stalin should be removed as the party's general secretary, while also mildly criticising Trotsky and other Bolshevik leaders. The relationship between Stalin and Lenin had broken down completely by this time, as was demonstrated during an event where Stalin crudely insulted Lenin's wife, [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. In March 1923, days before his third stroke, Lenin asked Trotsky to denounce Stalin and his so-called "Great-Russian nationalistic campaign" at the [[12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XIIth Party Congress]].

At the XIIth Party Congress in April 1923, however, just after Lenin's final stroke, Trotsky did not raise the issue.<ref>Chapter 11 of Trotsky's unfinished book, entitled [http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005/08/trotskys-stalin-chap-11-from-obscurity.html ''Stalin''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629051005/http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005/08/trotskys-stalin-chap-11-from-obscurity.html |date=29 June 2007}}</ref> Instead, he made a speech about intra-party democracy while avoiding any direct confrontation of the ''troika.''{{efn|Trotsky explained in Chapter 12 of his unfinished book [http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_maximumred_archive.html ''Stalin''] that he refused to deliver the report because "it seemed to me equivalent to announcing my candidacy for the role of Lenin's successor at a time when Lenin was fighting a grave illness.}} Stalin had prepared for the congress by replacing many local party delegates with those loyal to him, mostly at the expense of Zinoviev and Kamenev's backers.<ref>Chapter 12 of Trotsky's unfinished book, entitled [http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_maximumred_archive.html ''Stalin''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712104730/http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_maximumred_archive.html |date=12 July 2007}}</ref>

Stalin delivered the key reports on organisational structure and questions of nationality; while Zinoviev delivered the Central Committee political report, traditionally Lenin's prerogative. Among the resolutions adopted by the XIIth Congress were those calling for greater democracy within the Party, but these were vague and remained unimplemented.

The [[Stalin's rise to power|power struggle]] in the Soviet Union which emerged during Lenin's illness and eventual death would also determine the prospect of world revolution. In particular, the leadership of the German Communist party had requested that Moscow send Trotsky to Germany to direct the [[German October|1923 insurrection]]. However, this proposal was rejected by the Politburo which was controlled by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev who decided to send a commission of lower-ranking Russian Communist party members.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rogovin |first1=Vadim Zakharovich |title=Was There an Alternative?

=== Left opposition (1923–1924) ===
{{Main|Left Opposition}}
[[File:Trotsky-Annenkov 1922 sketch.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|A 1922 [[cubist]] portrait by [[Yury Annenkov]] – a version of this appeared on one of the earliest covers of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.]]

Starting in mid-1923, the Soviet economy ran into significant difficulties, which led to numerous strikes countrywide. Two secret groups within the Communist Party, "[[Workers' Truth]]" and "[[Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party|Workers' Group]]", were uncovered and suppressed by the Soviet secret police. On 8 October 1923 Trotsky sent a letter to the Central Committee and the [[Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Control Commission]], attributing these difficulties to lack of intra-Party democracy. Trotsky wrote:

{{Blockquote|In the fiercest moment of War Communism, the system of appointment within the party did not have one tenth of the extent that it has now. Appointment of the secretaries of provincial committees is now the rule. That creates for the secretary a position essentially independent of the local organization. [...] The bureaucratization of the party apparatus has developed to unheard-of proportions by means of the method of secretarial selection. [...] There has been created a very broad stratum of party workers, entering into the apparatus of the government of the party, who completely renounce their own party opinion, at least the open expression of it, as though assuming that the secretarial hierarchy is the apparatus which creates party opinion and party decisions. Beneath this stratum, abstaining from their own opinions, there lies the broad mass of the party, before whom every decision stands in the form of a summons or a command.<ref>Leon Trotsky, "The First Letter to the Central Committee" contained in the ''Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923–1925'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1975) pp. 55–56.{{ISBN?}}</ref>}}

Other senior communists who had similar concerns sent ''[[The Declaration of 46]]'' to the Central Committee on 15 October, in which they wrote:

{{Blockquote|[...] we observe an ever progressing, barely disguised division of the party into a secretarial hierarchy and into "laymen", into professional party functionaries, chosen from above, and the other party masses, who take no part in social life. [...] free discussion within the party has virtually disappeared, party public opinion has been stifled. [...] it is the secretarial hierarchy, the party hierarchy which to an ever greater degree chooses the delegates to the conferences and congresses, which to an ever greater degree are becoming the executive conferences of this hierarchy.}}

Although the text of these letters remained secret at the time, they had a significant effect on the Party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the ''[[NKVD troika|troika]]'' and its supporters on the issue of intra-Party democracy, notably in Zinoviev's ''Pravda'' article published on 7 November. Throughout November, the ''troika'' tried to come up with a compromise to placate, or at least temporarily neutralise, Trotsky and his supporters. (Their task was made easier by the fact that Trotsky was sick in November and December.) The first draft of the resolution was rejected by Trotsky, which led to the formation of a special group consisting of Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev, which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise. On 5 December, the Politburo and the Central Control Commission unanimously adopted the group's final draft as its resolution. On 8 December, Trotsky published an open letter, in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolution's ideas. The ''troika'' used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against Trotsky, accusing him of factionalism, setting "the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary Bolsheviks"<ref>Quoted in Max Shachtman. ''The Struggle for the New Course'', New York, New International Publishing Co., 1943.

Trotsky defended his position in a series of seven letters which were collected as ''The New Course'' in January 1924.<ref>Leon Trotsky, "The New Course" contained in ''The Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923–1925'', pp. 63–144. {{ISBN?}}</ref> The illusion of a "monolithic Bolshevik leadership" was thus shattered and a lively intra-Party discussion ensued, both in local Party organizations and in the pages of ''Pravda''. The discussion lasted most of December and January until the XIIIth Party Conference of 16–18 January 1924. Those who opposed the Central Committee's position in the debate were thereafter referred to as members of the [[Left Opposition]].<ref name="lom">[https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#left-opposition Left Opposition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716012705/https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#left-opposition#left-opposition |date=16 July 2018}}; Glossary of organizations on [[Marxists.org]]</ref> In 1924, in a series of conferences at Sverdlov University; Stalin cited several times, in a critical way 'the Permanentists', as the followers of Trotsky 'Permanent revolution'.

Since the ''troika'' controlled the Party apparatus through Stalin's Secretariat and ''Pravda'' through its editor Bukharin, it was able to direct the discussion and the process of delegate selection. Although Trotsky's position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organisation, it was defeated elsewhere, and the Conference was packed with pro-''troika'' delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky's position, and the Conference denounced "Trotskyism"{{efn|The term "Trotskyism" was first coined by the Russian liberal politician Pavel Milyukov, the first foreign minister in the Provisional Government who, in April 1917, was forced to demand that the British government release Trotsky.}} as a "petty bourgeois deviation".

Members of the Left Opposition represented most of the international elements of the party and held offices at the highest responsibility with [[Christian Rakovsky]], [[Adolph Joffe]] and [[Nikolay Krestinsky]] holding [[ambassador]]ial posts in [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]] and [[Berlin]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=Isaac |title=The Prophet: The Life of Leon Trotsky |date=5 January 2015 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn=978-1-78168-721-5 |page=735 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGznDwAAQBAJ&q=isaac+deutscher+trotsky |language=en}}</ref>

Internationally, Trotsky's opposition and criticism of the ruling troika received support from several, Central Committee members of foreign communist parties. This included [[Christian Rakovsky]], [[Council of People's Commissars (Ukraine)|Chairman]] of the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukraine Sovnarkom]],  [[Boris Souvarine]] of the [[French Communist Party]] and the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Poland|Polish Communist Party]] which was led by prominent theoreticians such as [[Maksymilian Horwitz]], [[Maria Koszutska]] and [[Adolf Warski]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rogovin |first1=Vadim Zakharovich |title=Was There an Alternative?

=== After Lenin's death (1924) ===
There was little overt political disagreement within the Soviet leadership throughout most of 1924. On the surface, Trotsky remained the most prominent and popular Bolshevik leader, although his "mistakes" were often alluded to by ''troika'' partisans. Behind the scenes, he was completely cut off from the decision-making process. Politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the ''troika'' and its supporters. Trotsky's control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy, Ephraim Sklyansky, and appointing [[Mikhail Frunze]], who was being groomed to take Trotsky's place.

At the [[13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|thirteenth Party Congress]] in May, Trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech:<ref>Chapter VIII of Boris Souvarine's [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/souvar/works/stalin/ch08.htm ''Stalin: A Critical Survey of Bolshevism''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430065533/http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/souvar/works/stalin/ch08.htm |date=30 April 2006}}{{ISBN?}}</ref>

[[File:Leon Trotsky attends The October Revolution parade 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Andrei Bubnov]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]], Leon Trotsky, [[Mikhail Kalinin]], and [[Mikhail Frunze]] attend the [[October Revolution]] parade in [[Red Square]] on 7 November 1924]]

In the meantime, the Left Opposition, which had coagulated somewhat unexpectedly in late 1923 and lacked a definite platform aside from general dissatisfaction with the intra-Party "regime", began to crystallise. It lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the ''troika'', but it also began formulating a program.

Economically, the Left Opposition opposed the development of capitalist elements in the Soviet economy and advocated for accelerated industrialization through state-led policies.<ref>Preobrazhensky, Yevgeni. ''The New Economics''. Oxford University Press, 1965.</ref>" That put them at odds with Bukharin and Rykov, the "Right" within the Party, who supported the ''troika''. On the question of world revolution, Trotsky and Karl Radek saw a period of stability in Europe, while Stalin and Zinoviev confidently predicted an "acceleration" of revolution in Western Europe in 1924. On the theoretical plane, Trotsky remained committed to the Bolshevik idea that the Soviet Union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution, while Stalin gradually came up with a policy of building "socialism in one country". These ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between Trotsky and the Left Opposition on the one hand, and Stalin and his allies on the other.

At the thirteenth Congress Kamenev and Zinoviev helped Stalin defuse Lenin's Testament, which belatedly came to the surface. But just after the congress, the ''troika'', always an alliance of convenience, showed signs of weakness. Stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yet in October 1924, Trotsky published ''[[Lessons of October]],''<ref>Leon Trotsky "Lessons of October" contained in ''Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923–1925'', pp. 199–258.</ref> a summary of the events of the 1917 revolution. He described Zinoviev and Kamenev's opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something they would have preferred left unmentioned. This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the ''Literary Discussion'', with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky. Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:
* Trotsky's disagreements and conflicts with Lenin and the Bolsheviks prior to 1917.
* Trotsky's alleged distortion of the events of 1917 to emphasise his role and diminish the roles played by other Bolsheviks.
* Trotsky's harsh treatment of his subordinates and other alleged mistakes during the Civil War.

Trotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilised all their resources to denounce him. They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People's Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 6 January 1925. Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate. Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation.

=== A year in the wilderness (1925) ===
[[File:Leon Trotsky and Leonid Serebryakov attend the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union May 1925.jpg|left|thumb|Leon Trotsky and [[Leonid Serebryakov]] attend the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union]] in May 1925]]

For Trotsky, 1925 was a difficult year. After the bruising ''Literary Discussion'' and losing his Red Army posts, he was effectively unemployed throughout the winter and spring. In May 1925, he was given three posts: chairman of the Concessions Committee, head of the electro-technical board, and chairman of the scientific-technical board of industry. Trotsky wrote in ''My Life''<ref name=":5">Chapter 22 of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch42.htm ''My Life''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420212234/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch42.htm |date=20 April 2006}}</ref> that he "was taking a rest from politics" and "naturally plunged into the new line of work up to my ears".<ref>Leon Trotsky, ''My Life'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1970) p. 520. {{ISBN?}}</ref> Trotsky would also deliver a tribute to Lenin in his 1925 short book, "Lenin".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=Lenin (1925) |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1925/lenin/index.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=Lenin |date=1959 |publisher=Garden City Books |page=215 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OyAfAAAAMAAJ&q=Lenin+is+no+more%2C+but+Leninism+endures.+The+immortal+in+Lenin%2C+his+doctrine%2C+his+work%2C+his+method%2C+his+example%2C+lives+in+us%2C+lives+in+the+party+that+he+founded%2C+lives+in+the+first+workmen%E2%80%99s+State+whose+head+he+was+and+which+he+guided. |language=en}}</ref>

In one of the few political developments that affected Trotsky in 1925, the circumstances of the controversy over Lenin's Testament were described by American Marxist [[Max Eastman]] in his book ''Since Lenin Died'' (1925). Trotsky denied these statements made by Eastman in an article he wrote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1925/07/lenin.htm|title=Leon Trotsky: Letter on Eastman's Book|date=22 November 2018|access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref>

In the meantime, the ''troika'' finally broke up. Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance [[Grigory Sokolnikov]] aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XIV Party Congress]] in December 1925. With only the Leningrad Party organization behind them, Zinoviev and Kamenev, dubbed ''The New Opposition'', were thoroughly defeated, while Trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and did not speak at the Congress.
[[File:Leon Trotsky speaks on the fifth anniversary of Soviet Georgia.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Trotsky addresses a meeting in the [[House of the Unions]] in March 1926]]

=== United Opposition (1926–1927) ===
In early 1926, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters in the "New Opposition" gravitated closer to Trotsky's supporters, and the two groups soon formed an alliance, which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the Communist Party. The alliance became known as the [[United Opposition (Soviet Union)|United Opposition]].

The United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party, and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The opposition remained united against [[Stalin]] throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the [[Chinese Nationalist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]]. The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme. At the XV Party Conference in October 1926, Trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat. In 1927, Stalin started using the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|GPU]] (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition. Rank-and-file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested.

Soviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911,<ref>Sterling Seagrave, ''Dragon Lady'' (Alfred A. Knopf Inc.: New York, 1992) p. 454.</ref> resulting in the abdication of the Chinese Emperor, [[Puyi]], on 12 February 1912.<ref>Compilation Group for the "History of Modern China" Series, ''The Revolution of 1911'' (Foreign Languages Press: Peking, 1976) p. 153.</ref> [[Sun Yat-sen]] established the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. In reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new "nationalist people's army and a national people's party"—the [[Kuomintang]]. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people's army. With the development of the nationalist army, a [[Northern Expedition]] was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small Chinese [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.<ref>Joseph Stalin, "The Prospects of Revolution in China" a speech to the Chinese Commission of the Executive Committee of the Communist International on 30 November 1926" contained in ''J.

Trotsky and most of his followers, on the other hand, refused to surrender and stayed the course. Trotsky was exiled to [[Almaty|Alma Ata, Kazakhstan]] on 31 January 1928. He was expelled from the Soviet Union to Turkey in February 1929, accompanied by his wife Natalia Sedova and their eldest son, Lev.{{sfn|Rubenstein|2013|pp=155, 202}}

=== Fate of Left Oppositionists after Trotsky's exile (1929–1941) ===
[[File:Soviet reaction to Leon Trotsky publication.jpg|thumb|The publication of Trotsky's autobiography ''[[My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)|My Life]]'' as reported in the Soviet Union in August 1929, with the editors of ''Projector'' titled the publication: "On the service of bourgeoisie"]]

After Trotsky's expulsion from the Soviet Union, Trotskyists within the Soviet Union began to waver. Between 1929 and 1932, most leading members of the Left Opposition surrendered to Stalin, "admitted their mistakes" and were reinstated in the Communist Party. One initial exception to this was [[Christian Rakovsky]], who inspired Trotsky between 1929 and 1934 with his refusal to capitulate as state suppression of any remaining opposition to Stalin increased by the year. In late 1932, Rakovsky had failed with an attempt to flee the Soviet Union and was exiled to [[Yakutia]] in March 1933. Answering Trotsky's request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist [[Jean Van Heijenoort]], together with his fellow activist [[Pierre Frank]], unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author [[Maxim Gorky]] to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Constantinople.<ref name="yedlin">Tova Yedlin, ''Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography'', Praeger/Greenwood, [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], 1992, pp. 201–02. {{ISBN|978-0275966058}}</ref> According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky's son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request.<ref name="yedlin" /> Rakovsky was the last prominent Trotskyist to capitulate to Stalin in April 1934, when Rakovsky formally "admitted his mistakes" (his letter to ''Pravda'', titled ''There Should Be No Mercy'', depicted Trotsky and his supporters as "agents of the German [[Gestapo]]").{{sfn|Medvedev|1976|p=169}} Rakovsky was appointed to high office in the Commissariat for Health and allowed to return to Moscow, also serving as Soviet ambassador to Japan in 1935.{{sfn|Feofanov|Barry|1995|p=22}} However, Rakovsky was cited in allegations involving the killing of [[Sergey Kirov]], and was arrested and imprisoned in late 1937, during the Great Purge.<ref name="faganoppexile">Fagan, Gus; Biographical Introduction to Christian Rakovsky; chapter ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/rakovsky/biog/biog5.htm Opposition and Exile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715212757/https://www.marxists.org/archive/rakovsky/biog/biog5.htm |date=15 July 2018}}''</ref>

Almost all Trotskyists who were still within the Soviet Union's borders were executed in the Great Purges of 1936–1938, although Rakovsky survived until the [[Medvedev Forest massacre]] of September 1941, where he was shot dead along with 156 other prisoners on Stalin's orders, less than three months into the [[Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Also among the Medvedev Forest victims was Trotsky's sister/Kamenev's first wife, [[Olga Kameneva]].{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=69}}

== Exile (1929–1940) ==

===Turkey===
After being deported from the Soviet Union, in February 1929, Trotsky arrived in Turkey. During his first two months in Turkey, Trotsky lived with his wife and eldest son at the [[List of diplomatic missions of Russia|Soviet Union Consulate]] in [[Istanbul]] and then at a nearby hotel in the city. In April 1929, Trotsky, his wife and son were moved to the island of [[Büyükada]] (also known by its Greek name of Prinkipo) by the Turkish authorities. On Büyükada, they were moved into a house called the Yanaros mansion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxist.com/esteban-volkov-return-to-prinkipo.htm|title=Esteban Volkov: Return to Prinkipo|first=Greg|last=Oxley|date=1 February 2004|website=Marxist.com|access-date=10 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110160934/https://www.marxist.com/esteban-volkov-return-to-prinkipo.htm|archive-date=10 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> During his exile in Turkey, Trotsky was under the surveillance of the Turkish police forces of [[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]]. Trotsky was also at risk from the many former White Army officers who lived on Prinkipo, officers who had opposed the [[October Revolution]] and who had been defeated by Trotsky and the Red Army in the Russian Civil War. However, Trotsky's European supporters volunteered to serve as bodyguards and assured his safety.<ref name="marxists.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1935/06/french.htm|title=Leon Trotsky: An Open Letter to the French Workers|date=10 June 1935|website=Marxists.org|access-date=8 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123230116/https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1935/06/french.htm|archive-date=23 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> At this time, he made requests to enter Belgium, France, Norway, Germany, and the United Kingdom,<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D7728106|title=Application by Leon Trotsky for permission to reside in England.|date=24 June 1929|publisher=UK National Archives}}</ref> but all refused access.

Trotsky wanted by no means that the alliance became a fusion, and he was afraid of the right gaining much power inside the bloc. Historian [[Pierre Broué]] concluded that the bloc dissolved in early 1933, since some of its members like Zinoviev and Kamenev joined Stalin again, and because there were no letters in the Trotsky Harvard archive mentioning the bloc after 1932.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pierre Broué: The "Bloc" of the Oppositions against Stalin (January 1980)|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/broue/1980/01/bloc.html|access-date=4 August 2020|website=Marxists.org}}</ref>

===France===
In July 1933, Trotsky was offered asylum in France by Prime Minister [[Édouard Daladier]]. Trotsky accepted the offer, but he was forbidden to live in [[Paris]] and soon found himself under the surveillance of the French police. From July 1933 to February 1934, Trotsky and his wife lived in [[Royan]]. The philosopher and activist [[Simone Weil]] also arranged for Trotsky and his bodyguards to stay for a few days at her parents' house.<ref name="marxists.org" /> Following the [[6 February 1934 crisis]] in France, the French minister of internal affairs, [[Albert Sarraut]], signed a decree to deport Trotsky from France.<ref name="marxists.org" /> However, no foreign government was found willing to accept Trotsky within its borders. Accordingly, the French authorities instructed Trotsky to move to a residence in the tiny village of [[Barbizon]] under the strict surveillance of the French police, where Trotsky found his contact with the outside world to be even worse than during his exile in Turkey.<ref name="marxists.org" />

In May 1935, soon after the French government had agreed to the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance]] with the Soviet Union government, Trotsky was officially told that he was no longer welcome in France. After weighing his options, Trotsky applied to move to Norway.

===Norway===
[[File:Heradsbygdveien 26, Hønefoss.jpg|thumb|Konrad Knudsen's House in Veksal, Norderhov, Norway, where Trotsky lived from June 1935 to September 1936]]
After obtaining permission from Justice Minister [[Trygve Lie]] to enter the country, Trotsky and his wife became a guest of [[Konrad Knudsen]] at [[Norderhov]], near [[Hønefoss]], and spent over a year living at Knudsen's house, from 18 June 1935 to 2 September 1936. Trotsky was hospitalized for a few weeks at the nearby [[Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål|Oslo Community Hospital]], from 19 September 1935.<ref name=Swain>Geoffrey Swain, ''Trotsky'' (Taylor & Francis, 2014) p.199-202</ref><ref>Oddvar Høidal, ''Trotsky in Norway: Exile, 1935–1937''</ref>

Following French media complaints about Trotsky's role in encouraging the [[Matignon Agreements (1936)|mass strikes in France in May and June 1936]] with his articles, the [[Johan Nygaardsvold]]-led Norwegian government began to exhibit disquiet about Trotsky's actions. In the summer of 1936, Trotsky's asylum was increasingly made a political issue by the fascist [[Nasjonal Samling]], led by [[Vidkun Quisling]],<ref name="author">Oddvar Høidal's ''Trotsky in Norway: Exile, 1935–1937.''</ref>&nbsp;along with an increase in pressure from the Soviet government on the Norwegian authorities. On 5 August 1936, Knudsen's house was burgled by fascists from the Nasjonal Samling while Trotsky and his wife were out on a seashore trip with Knudsen and his wife. The burglars targeted Trotsky's works and archives for vandalism. The raid was largely thwarted by Knudsen's daughter, Hjørdis, although the burglars did take a few papers from the nearest table as they left.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/12/nor.htm|title=Leon Trotsky in Norway (1936)|date=January 1937|website=Marxists.org|access-date=8 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123230427/https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/12/nor.htm|archive-date=23 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Although the perpetrators were caught and put on trial, the "evidence" obtained in the burglary was used by the government to make claims against Trotsky.<ref name="author" />&nbsp;

On 14 August 1936, the Soviet Press Agency [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] announced the discovery of a "Trotskyist–Zinovievist" plot and the imminent start of the [[Moscow trials]] of the accused. Trotsky demanded a complete and open enquiry into Moscow's accusations. The accused were sentenced to death, including Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, and executed on 25 August 1936. On 26 August 1936, eight policemen arrived at Knudsen's house demanding that Trotsky sign new conditions for residing in Norway. These conditions included agreeing to write no more about current political matters, to give no interviews, and to have all his correspondence (incoming and outgoing) inspected by the police. Trotsky categorically refused the conditions, and Trotsky was then told that he and his wife would soon be moved to another residence.<ref name="auto1" /> The following day Trotsky was interrogated by the police about his political activities, with the police officially citing Trotsky as a "witness" to the fascist raid of 5 August 1936.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/12/nor.htm|title=Leon Trotsky in Norway|access-date=8 March 2018|website=Marxists.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715072452/https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/12/nor.htm|archive-date=15 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 2 September 1936, four weeks after the break-in at Knudsen's house, Trygve Lie ordered that Trotsky and his wife be transferred to a farm in [[Hurum]],<ref name=Hurum>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/fremtiden/en-sensasjonell-rettssak/|title=En sensasjonell rettssak|access-date=31 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929072142/http://www.dagsavisen.no/fremtiden/en-sensasjonell-rettssak/|archive-date=29 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> where they were under house arrest.<ref name="author" />&nbsp;The treatment of Trotsky and his wife at Hurum was harsh, as they were forced to stay indoors for 22 hours per day under the constant guard of thirteen policemen, with only one hour permitted twice a day for a walk on the farm.<ref name="author" />&nbsp;Trotsky was prevented from posting any letters and prevented from arguing back against his critics in Norway and beyond.

When later living in Mexico, Trotsky was utterly scathing about the treatment he received during his 108 days at [[Hurum]], and accused the Norwegian government of trying to prevent him from publicly voicing his strong opposition to the Moscow Trials and other show trials, saying:

{{Blockquote|When I look back today on this period of internment, I must say that never, anywhere, in the course of my entire life—and I have lived through many things—was I persecuted with as much miserable cynicism as I was by the Norwegian "Socialist" government.

[[File:Trotskycannon.felixmorrow.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James P. Cannon|James Cannon]] and [[Felix Morrow]] with a bust of Trotsky]]
Trotsky wrote prolifically while in exile, penning several key works, including his ''[[History of the Russian Revolution]]'' (1930) and ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]'' (1936), a critique of the Soviet Union under [[Stalinism]]. He argued that the Soviet state had become a "[[degenerated workers' state]]" controlled by an undemocratic bureaucracy, which would eventually either be overthrown via a [[Political revolution (Trotskyism)|political revolution]] establishing a workers' democracy, or degenerate into a capitalist class.<ref>Daniel Gaido, "Marxist Analyses of Stalinism", ''Science & Society''
75/1 (Jan. 2011): 99–107. www.jstor.org/stable/25769086.</ref>

While in Mexico, Trotsky also worked closely with [[James P. Cannon|James Cannon]], [[Joseph Hansen (socialist)|Joseph Hansen]], and [[Farrell Dobbs]] of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] of the United States, and other supporters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/USAcannonJ.htm|title=James P.

Trotsky's critique of the Stalinist regime, though banned, was distributed to leaders of the Comintern. Among his other supporters was [[Chen Duxiu]], founder of the [[Chinese Communist Party]].<ref>Chen, Duxiu.

While in Mexico, Trotsky worked with [[André Breton]] and Diego Rivera to write the [[Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art]], published in 1938, which emphasized the need for artistic freedom outside the constraints of capitalist and Stalinist regimes. This collaboration inspired the creation of the International Federation of Independent Revolutionary Art (FIARI) in 1938. However, this organization was short-lived and ended before 1940.<ref>André Breton and Leon Trotsky, ''Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art'', 1938, in ''Free Rein'', University of Nebraska Press, 1995.</ref>

=== Moscow show trials ===
In August 1936, the first Moscow show trial of the so-called "Trotskyite–Zinovievite Terrorist Center" was staged in front of an international audience. During the trial, Zinoviev, Kamenev and 14 other accused, most of them prominent Old Bolsheviks, confessed to having plotted with Trotsky to kill Stalin and other members of the Soviet leadership. The court found every defendant guilty,
[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]], including Trotsky, sentencing them to death. The second show trial of Karl Radek, [[Grigori Sokolnikov]], [[Yuri Pyatakov]], and 14 others, took place in January 1937, during which more alleged conspiracies and crimes were linked to Trotsky. The findings were published in the book "Not Guilty".<ref>''Not Guilty; Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made Against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials, John Dewey, chairman'', New York, London, Harper & brothers, 1938, xv, 422 pp. 2nd edition New York, Monad Press, distributed by Pathfinder Press 1973, c. 1972 xxiii. {{ISBN?}}</ref>

=== Fourth International ===
{{Trotskyism}}
{{Main|Fourth International}}
For fear of splitting the communist movement, Trotsky initially opposed the idea of establishing parallel communist parties or a parallel international communist organization that would compete with the Third International. In mid-1933, after the [[Nazi]] takeover in Germany and the Comintern's response to it, he changed his mind. He said:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-ger/330715.htm|title=Marxists.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121162621/http://marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-ger/330715.htm|archive-date=21 November 2005|access-date=26 October 2005}}</ref>

''To Build Communist Parties and an International Anew'', 15 July 1933.</ref>}}

In 1938, Trotsky and his supporters founded the [[Fourth International]], which was intended to be a revolutionary and internationalist alternative to the Stalinist Comintern.

=== The Dies Committee ===
[[File:Leon Trotsky and American admirers. Mexico - NARA - 283642.jpg|thumb|Trotsky with American comrades, including [[Harry DeBoer]] (left) in Mexico, shortly before his assassination, 1940]]
Towards the end of 1939, Trotsky agreed to go to the United States to appear as a witness before the Dies Committee of the House of Representatives, a forerunner of the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]]. Representative [[Martin Dies Jr.]], chairman of the committee, demanded the suppression of the American Communist Party. Trotsky intended to use the forum to expose the NKVD's activities against him and his followers.

He made it clear that he also intended to argue against the suppression of the American Communist Party and to use the committee as a platform for a call to transform [[World War II]] into a world revolution. Many of his supporters argued against his appearance. When the committee learned the nature of the testimony Trotsky intended to present, it refused to hear him, and he was denied a visa to enter the United States. On hearing about it, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union immediately accused Trotsky of being in the pay of the oil magnates and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].{{sfn|Deutscher|2003c|p=482}}

=== Final months ===
After quarreling with Diego Rivera, Trotsky moved to his final residence on Avenida Viena in April 1939.<ref>Patenaude, Bertrand M.

[[File:Trotsky last office.jpg|thumb|The study where Leon Trotsky was assassinated with an ice axe on 20 August 1940]]
After a failed attempt to have Trotsky murdered in March 1939, Stalin assigned the overall organization of implementing the task to the NKVD officer [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], who, in turn, co-opted [[Nahum Eitingon]]. According to Sudoplatov's ''[[Special Tasks]]'', the NKVD proceeded to set up three NKVD agent networks to carry out the murder; these three networks were designed to operate entirely autonomously from the NKVD's hitherto-established spy networks in the U.S. and Mexico.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Pavel Sudoplatov|author2=Anatoli Sudoplatov|author3=Jerrold L.

A mountaineering ice axe has a narrow end, called the pick, and a flat wide end called the [[adze]].

This is why Mercader had no awards initially, though his mother was presented with the [[Order of Lenin]] for her own part of the operation. Ramón Mercader could not be either assassinated or freed from prison by the Soviets. When he was released from jail in 1960 and arrived in the USSR in 1961, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] signed a sentence to award Mercader the Order of Lenin, the Gold Star, and the title of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] "for the special deed".

Political scientist August Nimtz regarded Trotsky to have had better foresight than both Marxist and some non-Marxist intellectual observers with his work [[The Revolution Betrayed|''The Revolution Betrayed: What Is the Soviet Union and Where Is It Going?'']] (1936).

Historian [[Robert Vincent Daniels]] expressed the view that Trotsky was "undoubtedly the most brilliant [[intellect]] brought to prominence by the [[Russian Revolution]], outdistancing Lenin and other theoreticians both in the range of his interests and in the imaginativeness of his perceptions". Yet, he emphasised his personal arrogance as an underlying weakness which antagonised other members of the communist movement. Daniels also argued that had Trotsky assumed the role of [[Lenin's Testament|Lenin's successor]] then he would have presided over an [[Counterfactual history|alternate]] Soviet Union markedly distinct from Stalin's regime.{{sfn|Daniels|1993|pp=945–946}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trenton |first1=Russell |title=The Russian Revolution: The Fall of the Tsars and the Rise of Communism |date=15 July 2015 |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |isbn=978-1-68048-034-4 |pages=92–93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uS82CgAAQBAJ&dq=Had+Trotsky+won+the+struggle+to+succeed+Lenin,+the+character+of+the+Soviet+regime+would+almost+certainly+have+been+substantially+different,+particularly+in+foreign+policy,+cultural+policy,+and+the+extent+of+terroristic+repression.+Trotsky%E2%80%99s+failure,+however,+seems+to+have+been+almost+inevitable,+considering+his+own+qualities+and+the+conditions+of+authoritarian+rule+by+the+Communist+Party+organization.&pg=PA93 |language=en}}</ref>

Historian [[Orlando Figes]] noted that Trotsky never held a party post and rarely attended party meetings despite serving as a member of the Politburo. Figes also described him as having "too many characteristics that made it extraordinarily hard to work collectively with him".{{sfnm|1a1=Figes|1y=2017|1p=794}} Biographer [[Joshua Rubenstein]] regarded Trotsky's position among the Soviet elites as largely dependent on Lenin.

He also reached the view that Trotsky did not share Stalin's understanding of the party in which "fewer than 10 percent of its members were fully [[literate]]" and this was in spite of the fact that Stalin "was a man of narrower outlook in virtually every respect".<ref name="The Trotsky reappraisal">{{cite book |editor1-last=Brotherstone |editor1-first=Terence |editor2-last=Dukes |editor2-first=Paul |title=The Trotsky reappraisal |date=1992 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-7486-0317-6 |page=6}}</ref>

Trotsky himself ascribed his political defeat to external, objective conditions rather than the individual qualities of Stalin. He specifically argued that the failed series of international insurrections as seen in [[September Uprising|Bulgaria]] in 1923 and [[Shanghai massacre|China]] in 1927 had diminished the prospect of [[world socialism]] and demoralised the Russian working class which in turn strengthened the growth of an internal, Soviet bureaucracy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=The Revolution Betrayed: What is the Soviet Union and where is it Going? |date=1991 |publisher=Mehring Books |isbn=978-0-929087-48-1 |pages=85–98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiCYS9Z3lDoC&q=trotsky+defeat+bureaucracy |language=en}}</ref> Russian historian [[Vadim Rogovin]] also remarked that Trotsky, in the 1930s, did not abandon hope for the spread of the revolution.

[[File:Vladimir Lenin Speech in May 1920.jpg|thumb|Lenin delivering a speech to a crowd in Moscow Square, with Trotsky and [[Kamenev]] in the background, 1 May 1920.]]

His relations with Lenin have been a source of intense historical debate.{{sfnm|Swain|2014b|1pp=1–10|North|2010|2pp=52–90}} Historian [[Paul Le Blanc (historian)|Paul Le Blanc]] and philosopher [[Michael Lowy]] described Lenin and Trotsky as the "widely leading figures in the Russia's Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 as well as in the final years of the rising world communist movement". They characterized Lenin and Trotsky as "fierce adversaries" during the early years of the Russian socialist movement but described the duo as having reached a convergence and a substantial agreement in 1917 before colluding their efforts to achieve the October Revolution. They also highlighted the mutual appreciation and respect between Lenin and Trotsky with the former seeking to work closely with Trotsky on the [[Iskra]] newspaper, prior to their polemical disagreements, and Lenin acknowledging that his theory on permanent revolution "happened to be right" after 1917.<ref name="Palgrave Handbook">{{cite book |last1=Rockmore |first1=Tom |last2=Levine |first2=Norman |title=The Palgrave Handbook of Leninist Political Philosophy |date=19 December 2018 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-137-51650-3 |pages=231–255 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nWADwAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref> 

However, Swain viewed the notion that Trotsky was Lenin's natural heir a myth and cited several scholars such as Erik Van Rees, James White and Richard B.Day who Swain claimed had challenged the traditional characterization of their relationship.{{sfnm|Swain|2014b|1pp=1–10}} North specifically rejected this position and argued Swain sought to discredit historical works appreciative of Trotsky. North continued to argue that Swain gave an insufficient consideration of the "complex historical, political, social and theoretical issues that arise in any serious study of the Lenin-Trotsky relationship". He also asserted that Swain had distorted and misrepresented the positions of the cited scholars.{{sfn|North|2010|pp=52–90}} Le Blanc also disputed Swain's representation of Trotsky and referenced various historians which included [[E.H. Carr]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[Moshe Lewin]], [[Ronald Suny]] and [[W. Bruce Lincoln]] across different generations. According to Le Blanc, these historians on balance had tilted "toward the view that Lenin's desired "heir" was collective responsibility in which Trotsky placed an important role and within which Stalin would be dramatically demoted (if not removed)".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blanc |first1=Paul Le |title=Leon Trotsky |date=15 April 2015 |publisher=Reaktion Books |isbn=978-1-78023-471-7|pages=1–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMCkCQAAQBAJ&dq=Paul+le+blanc+swain+heir&pg=PT14 |language=en}}</ref> Similarly, historian [[Roy Medvedev]] noted the close association of Trotsky and Lenin in the Soviet republic throughout the period of 1921–24. Medvedev mentioned a number of public commendations such as "greetings in honour of comrades Lenin and Trotsky were announced at many [[political demonstration|rallies]] and meetings, and [[portraits]] of Lenin and Trotsky hung on the walls of many Soviet and party institutions".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Medvedev |first1=Roj Aleksandrovič |title=Let history judge: the origins and consequences of Stalinism |date=1989 |publisher=Columbia Univ.

Initially, Lenin turned down the leading position of [[Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars]] when the Bolsheviks formed a new government, after the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, and suggested Trotsky for the position. However, Trotsky refused the position and other Bolsheviks insisted that Lenin assume principal responsibility which thereafter resulted in Lenin eventually accepting the role of chairman.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pipes |first1=Richard |title=The Russian Revolution |date=1990 |location=New York |publisher= Knopf |isbn=978-0-394-50241-0 |page=499 |url=https://archive.org/details/russianrevolutio00pipe/page/498/mode/2up?view=theater}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=Isaac |title=The prophet armed: Trotsky, 1879-1921 |date=1954 |publisher=New York, Oxford University Press |page=325 |url=https://archive.org/details/prophetarmedtrot01deut/page/324/mode/2up}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sukhanov |first1=Nikolai Nikolaevich |title=The Russian Revolution 1917: A Personal Record by N.N.

Soviet writer [[Maxim Gorky]] recollected Lenin in the first version of his sketch, ''V.I. Lenin'', dismissing rumours of an alleged political difference between himself and Trotsky with the words: "There are many lies, and it seems, particularly many lies about me and Trotsky". Gorky also stated that Lenin made an approving assessment of Trotsky due to his military organisation of the army in a single year.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rogovin |first1=Vadim Zakharovich |title=Was There an Alternative?

She similarly expressed this view in a personal note after Lenin's death that her husband's attitude towards Trotsky had "not changed until his death" since their initial meeting in London.<ref name="Palgrave Handbook" /> In his final months, Lenin read several of Trotsky's works among a wider collection of books which interested him. Lenin read ''Problems of Everyday Life'' in the last month of his life and instructed Krupskaya to read him a passage from another of Trotsky's books that characterised Marxism and Leninism. Lenin also read Trotsky's pamphlet, ''[[New Course (Trotsky book)|The New Course]]'', on the day prior to his death.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rogovin |first1=Vadim Zakharovich |title=Was There an Alternative?

Rogovin interpreted Lenin's proposal to the Politburo that Trotsky be confirmed as the "[[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Chairman of the Council of the Sovnarkom]]" as signifying that he was entrusted "with the highest government post" and he argued that this was also considerable given Lenin's illness at the time. Rogovin also referenced a previous proposal by Lenin in 1917 to appoint Trotsky with another senior position as [[People's Commissar of Internal Affairs]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rogovin |first1=Vadim Zakharovich |title=Was There an Alternative?

[[Slavic studies]] scholar Derek Watson presumed that Trotsky would have been the first vice-chairman of an additional [[RSFSR]] body working alongside the other deputies.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=Derek |title=Molotov and Soviet Government: Sovnarkom, 1930-41 |date=27 July 2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-349-24848-3 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhm_DAAAQBAJ&dq=Trotsky+chairman+rykov&pg=PA25 |language=en}}</ref>
Deutscher argued that had Trotsky assumed the post of deputy, then it would have been difficult for [[Alexei Rykov|Rykov]] to have been promoted above him as chairman after Lenin's death in 1924.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=Isaac |title=The prophet unarmed: Trotsky, 1921-1929 |date=1965 |publisher=New York, Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-394-70747-1 |page=135 |url=https://archive.org/details/prophetunarmed00isaa/page/134/mode/2up?q=promote+rykov+}}</ref>  Polish historian [[Marian Kamil Dziewanowski]] also echoed these views and argued that had Trotsky accepted the post of vice-chairman then his prestige and power would have been strengthened as a counter-weight to Stalin's growing influence. Dziewanowski expressed the view that Trotsky as vice-chairman would have been a natural successor to Lenin as [[Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union|Chairman of the Soviet Union]]. However, his rejection of the position enabled Stalin to place Rykov as Lenin's successor and serve as a key ally in the Politburo against Trotsky.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dziewanowski |first1=M.

Similarly, Soviet historian Victor Danilov believed that Lenin's proposed appointment of Trotsky as deputy "would have made him [[order of succession|in effect Lenin's successor]]". Danilov also cited Politburo Secretary Bazhanov's notes of a concluding speech delivered by Trotsky in 1923 to the wider party membership. Trotsky explained his decision to decline the proposed position of Lenin's chief deputy due to concerns about his "Jewish origins" which could accentuate anti-semitic attitudes towards the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Danilov |first1=Victor |last2=Porter |first2=Cathy |title=We Are Starting to Learn about Trotsky |journal=History Workshop |date=1990 |issue=29 |pages=136–146 |jstor=4288968 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4288968 |issn=0309-2984}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Daniels |first1=Robert V. |title=The Rise and Fall of Communism in Russia |date=1 October 2008 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-13493-3 |page=438 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27JGzAoMLjoC&dq=Victor+Danilov+Trotsky&pg=PA438 |language=en}}</ref> Mccauley stated that Trotsky would "almost certainly" have become the successor had Lenin succumbed to his first stroke in 1922.{{sfn|Mccauley|2014|p=51}} Deutscher noted that Zinoviev had been Lenin's closest discipline rather than Trotsky between 1907 and 1917. However, Zinoviev's opposition to the October revolution had strained his relations with Lenin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=Isaac |title=The prophet unarmed: Trotsky, 1921–1929 |date=1959 |location=London; New York |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-501094-7 |pages=78–79 |url=https://archive.org/details/prophetunarmedtr0000unse/page/76/mode/1up?q=Tsaritsyn+battles+}}</ref>

Opponents such as [[Winston Churchill]] even argued that "Lenin [had] indeed regarded Trotsky as his political heir" and sought to protect him before his passing in 1924.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Churchill |first1=Winston S. |title=Great Contemporaries |date=5 July 2016 |publisher=Rosetta Books |isbn=978-0-7953-4967-6 |page=127 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWhsDwAAQBAJ&dq=Lenin+indeed+regarded+Trotsky+as+his+political+heir&pg=PT214 |language=en}}</ref> Zinoviev and Kamenev also viewed Trotsky as Lenin's most likely successor and sided with Stalin out of fear that Trotsky would remove them from the party leadership.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brackman |first1=Roman |title=The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life |date=2001 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-7146-5050-0 |page=168 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQL8POkFGIQC&dq=Trotsky+state+planning+deputy&pg=PA168 |language=en}}</ref> However, his chief  adversary Stalin, strongly denied claims that Trotsky was the succeeding chairman following Lenin's illness. He pointed out that Trotsky was expected to serve as one of several  deputy chairmen under Lenin which included Kamenev, Rykov and [[Alexander Tsiurupa|Tsiurupa]]. Although, he did reference a written document signed by Lenin in 1922 which assigned Trotsky and Kamenev different areas of focus as deputy chairmen.

Shortly before his assassination, Trotsky agreed to sell the bulk of the papers he still had to [[Harvard University]]. After his assassination, his widow, Natalya Sedova collected his remaining papers and shipped them to Harvard, and in the years following, Harvard managed to collect additional papers that had been hidden from both Soviet and Nazi agents in Europe.<ref>Gerald M.

Trotsky was never [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] during the rule of the Soviet government, despite the [[de-Stalinization]]-era rehabilitation of most other [[Old Bolshevik]]s killed during the Great Purges. His son, Sergei Sedov, who died in 1937, was rehabilitated in 1988, as was Nikolai Bukharin. Beginning in 1989, Trotsky's books, forbidden until 1987, were published in the Soviet Union.

Trotsky was rehabilitated on 16 June 2001 by the [[Prosecutor General of Russia|General Prosecutor's Office]] of the Russian Federation (Certificates of Rehabilitation No. 13/2182-90, No. 13-2200-99 in Archives Research Center "Memorial").<ref>[http://memorial-nic.org/iofe/3.html В.

Trinidadian historian [[CLR James]] wrote, in the aftermath of Trotsky's death, that he evoked strong feelings of enmity and fear from several political figures. According to James, this included [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Winston Churchill]] because "these men knew his stature, the power of what he stood for, and were never lulled by the smallness of his forces".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blanc |first1=Paul Le |title=Leon Trotsky |date=15 April 2015 |publisher=Reaktion Books |isbn=978-1-78023-471-7 |pages=1–100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMCkCQAAQBAJ&dq=winston+churchill+trotsky+clr+james&pg=PT123 |language=en}}</ref>

Historian [[Harold Shukman]] assessed the conflicting perspectives on Trotsky's legacy in the Soviet Union and the [[Western world]]. He also commented on the lack of a balanced view. Specifically, he stated:

<blockquote>Trotsky's legacy, unlike those of Stalin and Lenin, had long been submerged and obliterated as a topic of debate, and his place in Soviet history books had correspondingly diminished to one of no importance. For Western readers, however, Trotsky has always been one of the most enigmatic and powerful personalities of the Russian revolution, a Mephistophelian figure whose life ended in an appropriately dramatic way.<ref>{{cite book |last=Volkogonov |first=Dmitri |date=18 June 2008 |others=Harold Shukman (ed. and trans.) |title=Trotsky: Eternal Revolutionary |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-4391-0573-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/trotskyeternalre0000volk/page/n27/mode/2up xxi] (Preface) |url=https://archive.org/details/trotskyeternalre0000volk/page/n27/mode/2up |language=en}}</ref></blockquote>

Political theorist David North attributed his diminished influence and historical role to the "virtually unlimited resources of the Soviet regime, and of [[Marxism-Leninism|Stalinist-run]] parties throughout the world, [which] were devoted to blackguarding Trotsky as an anti-Soviet saboteur, terrorist and fascist agent. Within the Soviet Union, his political co-thinkers, past and present, were ruthlessly exterminated".{{sfn|North|2010|pp=160–161}} North was also critical of the biographical literature on Trotsky's legacy written by some historians such as [[Ian Thatcher]], Geoffrey Swain and Robert Service.

In 2018, John Kelly wrote that "almost 80 years after Leon Trotsky founded the Fourth International, there are now Trotskyite organisations in 57 countries, including most of [[Western Europe]] and [[Latin America]]". However, he also argued that no Trotskyite group had ever led a revolution or built an enduring mass political party.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kelly |first1=John |title=Contemporary Trotskyism: Parties, Sects and Social Movements in Britain |date=14 March 2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-36894-6 |page=iii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mJRDwAAQBAJ&q=john+kelly+57+countries |language=en}}</ref>

Robert Alexander made a similar observation in 1991 that Trotskyists had never assumed power in any nation but explained that the international movement did "not enjoy the support of a well-established regime, as did the heirs of Stalinism". Alexander also recognised that the "persistence of the movement in a [[Trotskyism#Trotskyist movements|wide variety of countries]]" and the instability of political events across most of the world means the "possibility that a Trotskyist party might come to power in the foreseeable future cannot be totally ruled out".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=Robert Jackson |title=International Trotskyism: 1929–1985: A Documented Analysis of the Movement |date=1991 |publisher=Duke Univ.

On the other hand, British historian and socialist Christian Høgsbjerg believed that academic literature on Trotskyism had minimised its historical role in building wider social movements. Høgsbjerg stressed the key role of British Trotskyists in various movements such as the [[Vietnam Solidarity Campaign]] (1966–71), the [[Anti-Nazi League]] (1977–81), the [[All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation|Anti Poll Tax Federation]] (1989–91) and the [[Stop the War Coalition]] (2001).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Høgsbjerg |first1=Christian |title=Trotskyology: A review of John Kelly, Contemporary Trotskyism: Parties, Sects and Social Movements in Britain |journal=International Socialism |date=18 October 2018 |issue=160 |url=https://isj.org.uk/trotskyology/}}</ref>

Historian Betrand Patenaunde also noted his social appeal among the [[Petrograd]] workers in which he drew "vast crowds of [[working class|workers]], [[soldiers]] and [[sailors]] in Petrograd with his spellbinding [[rhetoric|oratory]] in 1917".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Patenaude |first1=Bertrand |title=Stalin's Nemesis: The Exile and Murder of Leon Trotsky |date=6 May 2010 |publisher=Faber & Faber |isbn=978-0-571-25834-5 |page=110 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81Se6bj7D0YC&dq=vast+crowds+of+workers,+soldiers+and+sailors+in+Petrograd+with+his+spellbinding+oratory+in+1917&pg=PA10 |language=en}}</ref>

A number of scholars and Western socialists have argued that Trotsky represented a more [[democracy|democratic]] [[anti-Stalinist Left|alternative]] to Stalin with particular emphasis drawn to his activities in the pre-Civil War period and as leader of the Left Opposition.{{sfnm|1a1= Daniels|1y=2008b|1pp=189-198|2a1=Barnett|2y=2013b|2p=101|3a1=Rogovin|3y=2021b|3pp=1-15,497|4a1=Day|4y=1990|4pp=159-188|5a1=Deutscher|5y=2015a|5pp=674-676, 1558}} Prior to the October Revolution, Trotsky had been part of an old [[radical democracy]] which included both Left Mensheviks and Left Bolsheviks.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Daniels |first1=Robert V. |title=The Rise and Fall of Communism in Russia |date=1 October 2008 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=181 |isbn=978-0-300-13493-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27JGzAoMLjoC |language=en}}</ref> He had also proposed the election of a new Soviet [[presidium]] with other [[socialist]] parties on the basis of [[proportional representation]] in September 1917.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=Isaac |title=The Prophet: The Life of Leon Trotsky |date=5 January 2015 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn=978-1-78168-721-5 |pages=293 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGznDwAAQBAJ&q=isaac+deutscher+trotsky+the+prophet |language=en}}</ref> Deutscher described Trotsky as the "[[Saint Petersburg Soviet|Soviet's moving spirit]]" in 1905 and highlighted his representation of Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and the rest of the Soviets on major occasions.<ref name="Verso Books">{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=Isaac |title=The Prophet: The Life of Leon Trotsky |date=6 January 2015 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn=978-1-78168-560-0 |pages=141, 674–676 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yN-QEAAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref> Rogovin stated that the Left Opposition, led by Trotsky, was a political movement that "offered a real alternative to Stalinism, and that to crush this movement was the primary function of the [[Great Terror|Stalinist terror]]".

Conversely, other figures such as Volkogonov have strongly criticised his defence of the Red Terror and dictatorship of the proletariat.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1996|p=xxiii}} Service argued that his "ideas and practices laid several foundation stones for the erection of the Stalinist political, economic, social and even cultural edifice".{{sfn|Service|2009|pp=3}} Cherniaev considered Trotsky to be partly responsible for the establishment of a one-party, [[authoritarian]] state and initiating several military practices such as summary executions which later became standard practice during the Stalinist era.<ref name="auto2"/> Thatcher cited his defence of terror in his work, ''[[Terrorism and Communism: A Reply to Karl Kautsky]],'' but also acknowledged that Trotsky was capable of [[pardon|leniency]] and had personally urged that White army deserters be treated with understanding.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thatcher |first1=Ian D. |title=Trotsky |date=27 June 2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-57214-4 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cU3yFMLm1voC&dq=trotsky+leniency+white+soldiers&pg=PT91 |language=en}}</ref>

This view has been disputed by some writers such as French socialist historian [[Pierre Broue]] who criticised Western representations of Trotsky's role in the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] which he argued had falsely presented Trotsky as the principal figure that led and was responsible for the repression.

Various historians have credited Trotsky and the Left Opposition with shifting the Soviet economic orientation from the [[New Economic Policy|NEP]] policy towards a [[planned economy]] through their proposals for mass industrialization.{{sfnm|1a1=Carr|1a2=Davies|1y=1971|1p=199|2a1=Phillips|2y=2000|2p=23|3a1=Fitzpatrick|3y=2008|3p=110|4a1=Payne|4a2=Phillips|4y=2013|4p=1936|5a1=McDermott|5y=2006|5p=61|6a1=Lee|6y=2005|6p=8|7a1=Deutscher|7y=2003b|7p=468}} Trotsky had delivered a joint report to the April Plenum of the Central Committee in 1926 which proposed a program for national industrialization and the replacement of annual plans with [[Five-year plans of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]].

His politics differed in some aspects from those of Stalin or [[Mao Zedong]], most importantly in his rejection of the theory of "socialism in one country" and his declaring of the need for an international "permanent revolution". Numerous Fourth Internationalist groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyists and see themselves as standing in this tradition. However, they have different interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this.

In the post-Leninist struggle, Trotsky and the Left-United Opposition had advocated for a programme of rapid [[industrialization]], voluntary collectivisation of agriculture, and the expansion of a [[soviet democracy|worker's democracy]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mandel |first1=Ernest |title=Trotsky as Alternative |date=5 May 2020 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn=978-1-78960-701-7 |pages=32–66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVmcEAAAQBAJ&dq=trotsky+as+alternative+mandel&pg=PT80 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Leon Trotsky: Platform of the Joint Opposition (1927) |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1927/opposition/index.htm |website=www.marxists.org}}</ref> In 1936, Trotsky called for the restoration of the right of criticism in areas such as [[economic policy|economic matters]], the revitalization of [[trade unions]] and free elections of the [[List of political parties in the Soviet Union|Soviet parties]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=Isaac |title=The Prophet: The Life of Leon Trotsky |date=5 January 2015 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn=978-1-78168-721-5 |page=1348|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGznDwAAQBAJ&q=isaac+deutscher+trotsky+the+prophet |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=The Revolution Betrayed: What is the Soviet Union and where is it Going? |date=1991 |publisher=Mehring Books |isbn=978-0-929087-48-1 |page=218 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiCYS9Z3lDoC |language=en}}</ref> Supporters of the Fourth International echo Trotsky's opposition to Stalinist [[totalitarianism]], advocating political revolution and arguing that socialism cannot sustain itself without democracy.{{sfn|Ree|1998}}

Trotsky was an early proponent of economic planning since 1923 and favored an accelerated pace of industrialization.<ref name=Twiss>{{cite book |last1=Twiss |first1=Thomas M. |title=Trotsky and the Problem of Soviet Bureaucracy |date=8 May 2014 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-26953-8 |pages=88–113 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3o2fAwAAQBAJ&dq=Trotsky+economic+planning+1923&pg=PA135 |language=en}}</ref> In 1921, he had also been a prominent supporter of [[Gosplan]] as a newly established body and called for the strengthening of its formal responsibilities to support a balanced level of economic reconstruction after the Civil War.{{sfn|Deutscher|2015a|pp=587}} Trotsky also urged economic [[decentralisation]] between the state, [[oblast]] regions and factories to counter structural inefficiency and the problem of bureaucracy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Twiss |first1=Thomas M. |title=Trotsky and the Problem of Soviet Bureaucracy |date=8 May 2014 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-26953-8 |pages=105–106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3o2fAwAAQBAJ&dq=trotsky+decentralized+planning&pg=PA106 |language=en}}</ref>

Originally, he had proposed the principles underlying the [[New Economic Policy|N.E.P.]] in 1920 to the [[Politburo]] to mitigate urgent economic matters arising from war communism. He would later reproach Lenin privately about the delayed government response in 1921-1922.{{sfn|Deutscher|2015a|pp=507-508,585}}{{sfn|Rubenstein|2011|p=161}} However, his position differed from the majority of Soviet leaders at the time who fully supported the [[New Economic policy]].<ref name=Twiss /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Day |first1=Richard B. |title=Leon Trotsky and the Politics of Economic Isolation |date=1973 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52436-0 |page=109 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGx-pzsksksC&dq=Trotsky+economic+planning+1923&pg=PA109 |language=en}}</ref> 

Comparatively, Trotsky believed that planning and N.E.P should develop within a mixed framework until the socialist sector gradually superseded the private industry.{{sfn|Deutscher|2015a|pp=646}} He found allies among a circle of economic theorists and administrators which included [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]] and [[Georgy Pyatakov]], deputy chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy|Council of the National Economy]].{{sfn|Deutscher|2015a|pp=592}} More broadly, [[intellectuals]] would constitute the core of the Left Opposition during the succession period.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Daniels |first1=Robert V. |title=The Rise and Fall of Communism in Russia |date=1 October 2008 |publisher=Yale University Press|page=189|isbn=978-0-300-13493-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27JGzAoMLjoC |language=en}}</ref>

Trotsky had specified the need for the "overall guidance in planning i.e. the systematic co-ordination of the fundamental sectors of the state economy in the process of adapting to the present market" and urged for a national plan<ref>{{cite web |title=Trotsky: The Single Economic Plan |url=https://wdc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/russian/id/8044/ |website=wdc.contentdm.oclc.org |language=en}}</ref> alongside currency stabilization.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nove |first1=Alec |title=Socialism, Economics and Development (Routledge Revivals) |date=12 November 2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-58266-0 |pages=89–90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWn4BbCEH6gC&dq=Trotsky+economic+planning+1923&pg=PA89 |language=en}}</ref> He also rejected the Stalinist conception of industrialisation which favoured [[heavy industry]].

Trotsky and the Left Opposition developed a number of economic proposals in response to the [[scissor crisis]] which had undermined relations between the workers and peasants in 1923–1924. This included a [[progressive tax]] on the wealthier sections of populations such as the [[kulak]]s and [[NEPmen]] alongside an equilibrium of the import-export balance to access accumulated reserves to purchase machinery from abroad to increase the pace of industrialization.{{sfn|Mandel|1995|p=62}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Documents of the 1923 opposition |url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/ilo/1923-lo/index.htm |website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>

The policy was later adopted by members of the United Opposition which also advocated a programme of rapid industrialization during the debates of 1924 and 1927. The United Opposition proposed a progressive tax on wealthier peasants, the encouragement of [[agricultural cooperatives]] and the formation of collective farms on a voluntary basis.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kemp |first1=Tom |title=Industrialisation in the Non-Western World |date=14 January 2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-90133-4 |pages=1–150 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjWtAgAAQBAJ&dq=trotsky+progressive+tax+left+opposition&pg=PT67 |language=en}}</ref>

Trotsky as president of the [[electrification]] commission along with members of the Opposition bloc had put forward an electrification plan which involved the construction of the [[hydroelectric]] [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station|Dnieprostroi dam]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carr |first1=Edward Hallett |title=A History of Soviet Russia |date=1970 |publisher=Baltimore, Md. : Penguin Books |page=180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbobAAAAIAAJ&q=Trotsky+electrification |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=My Life |date=2 March 2023 |publisher=Wellred Books |pages=1–50 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MioAEAAAQBAJ&dq=trotsky+electrification+offering+the+peasant+a+gramophone+instead+of+a+cow&pg=PT58 |language=en}}</ref> He had also warned against the danger of market spontaneity and called for a well-thought out strategy of [[commercial balance]]. Overall, Trotsky was sharply critical of Bukharin and Stalin's views on the state of the Soviet economy. Russian historian, Vladimir Buldakov found that some historical research had supported the view that Trotsky advocated the most rational decisions for industrial development.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buldakov |first1=Vladimir |title=Trotsky: October and its perspective in The Trotsky reappraisal.

In 1932–33, Trotsky maintained the need for mass participation in the operationalisation of the planned economy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=Writings of Leon Trotsky.

According to Fitzpatrick, the scholarly consensus was that Stalin appropriated the position of the Left Opposition on such matters as [[industrialisation]] and [[collectivisation]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=Sheila |title=The Old Man |journal=London Review of Books |date=22 April 2010 |volume=32 |issue=8 |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v32/n08/sheila-fitzpatrick/the-old-man |language=en |issn=0260-9592}}</ref> Other scholars have argued that the economic programme of Trotsky differed from the forced [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|policy of collectivisation]] implemented by Stalin after 1928 due to the levels of brutality associated with its enforcement.{{sfn|Mandel|1995|p=59}}<ref name="Yale University Press"/>

=== Permanent Revolution ===
{{Main|Permanent revolution}}
[[File:Diego rivera Commies.jpg|thumb|A [[Diego Rivera]] mural  (''[[Man, Controller of the Universe]]'') depicts Trotsky with [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] as a true champion of the workers' struggle]]

The Permanent Revolution concept is the theory that the [[bourgeois]] democratic tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers' state, and that the creation of a workers' state would inevitably involve inroads against capitalist property. Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into [[proletarian]] tasks. Although most closely associated with Leon Trotsky, the call for a "Permanent Revolution" is first found in the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in March 1850, in the aftermath of the [[1848 Revolution]], in their [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm Address] of the Central Committee to the [[Communist League]]:

{{Blockquote|It is our interest and our task to make the revolution permanent until all the more or less propertied classes have been driven from their ruling positions, until the proletariat has conquered state power and until the association of the proletarians has progressed sufficiently far—not only in one country but in all the leading countries of the world—that competition between the proletarians of these countries ceases and at least the decisive forces of production are concentrated in the hands of the workers. ... Their battle-cry must be: '''The Permanent Revolution'''.}}

Trotsky's conception of the Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism [[Georgy Plekhanov]], that in "backward" countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself. Trotsky first developed this conception in collaboration with Alexander Parvus in late 1904–1905. The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky's books ''[[1905 (book)|1905]]'' and in "Permanent Revolution", which also contains his essay "[[Results and Prospects]]." Some Trotskyists have argued that the state of the [[Third World]] shows that capitalism offers no way forward for underdeveloped countries, thus again proving the central tenet of the theory.<ref>{{cite web|title=The mass uprising in Tunisia and the perspective of permanent revolution|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/01/pers-j17.html|work=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|date=17 January 2011 |publisher=International Committee of the Fourth International|access-date=3 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529173202/http://wsws.org/en/articles/2011/01/pers-j17.html|archive-date=29 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to his biographer, Isaac Deutscher, Trotsky explicitly supported revolution through [[proletarian internationalism]] but was opposed to achieving this via [[military]] [[conquest]] with documented references made to his 
personal opposition to the [[Polish–Soviet War|war with Poland]] in 1920, proposed armistice with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] and temperance with staging [[British foreign policy in the Middle East|anti-British revolts]] in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=Isaac |title=The Prophet: The Life of Leon Trotsky |date=5 January 2015 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn=978-1-78168-721-5 |pages=472–473 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGznDwAAQBAJ&q=isaac+deutscher+trotsky |language=en}}</ref>

=== United front and theory of fascism===
{{Main|United front|The Struggle Against Fascism in Germany}}
[[File:Fascism.png|thumb|Leon Trotsky's original pamphlet '''''"[[Fascism]]: What it is and how to fight it"''''' published posthumously which elaborated on the need of a united front for mass mobilisation.]]
Trotsky was a central figure in the Comintern during its first four congresses. During this time, he helped to generalize the strategy and tactics of the Bolsheviks to newly formed Communist parties across Europe and further afield. From 1921 onwards, the [[united front]], a method of uniting revolutionaries and reformists in the common struggle while winning some of the workers to revolution, was the central tactic put forward by the Comintern after the defeat of the German revolution.

Trotsky was a strong critic of the shifting Comintern policy position under Stalin which directed German Communists to treat social democrats as "[[social fascism|social fascists]]". Historian Bertrand Patenaude believed that the Comintern policy following the "[[Great Break (USSR)|Great Break]]" facilitated the rise of Hitler's party.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Patenaude |first1=Betrand |title="Trotsky and Trotskyism" in The Cambridge History of Communism: Volume 1, World Revolution and Socialism in One Country 1917–1941 |date=21 September 2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-21041-6 |page=203 |language=en}}</ref> Marxist theorist and economist [[Hillel Ticktin]] argued that Trotsky's political strategy and approach to fascism such as the emphasis on an organisational bloc between the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social-Democratic party]] during the interwar period would very likely have prevented Hitler [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Weimar parties fail to halt Nazis|from ascending to political power]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ticktin |first1=Hillel |title=Trotsky's political economy of capitalism. Brotherstone, Terence; Dukes, Paul,(eds) |date=1992 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-0317-6 |page=227}}</ref>

Trotsky also formulated a theory of fascism based on a dialectical interpretation of events to analyze the manifestation of [[Italian fascism]] and the early emergence of Nazi Germany from 1930 to 1933.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wistrich |first1=Robert S. |title=Leon Trotsky's Theory of Fascism |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |date=1976 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=157–184 |doi=10.1177/002200947601100409 |jstor=260195 |s2cid=140420352 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/260195 |issn=0022-0094}}</ref>

After he was exiled and politically marginalized by Stalinism, Trotsky continued to argue for a united front against fascism in Germany and Spain. According to Joseph Choonara of the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] in ''[[International Socialism]]'', his articles on the united front represent an essential part of his political legacy.<ref>Joseph Choonara, [http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=397&issue=117 "The United Front"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107230355/http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=397&issue=117 |date=7 January 2008}}, ''[[International Socialism]]'', 117.</ref>

=== Uneven and combined development ===
{{Main|Uneven and combined development}}

The concept of uneven and combined development derived from the political theories of Trotsky.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peck |first1=Jamie |last2=Varadarajan |first2=Latha |title=Uneven Regional Development |journal=International Encyclopedia of Geography: People, the Earth, Environment and Technology |date=6 March 2017 |pages=1–13 |doi=10.1002/9781118786352.wbieg0721 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118786352.wbieg0721 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd |isbn=9780470659632 |language=en}}</ref> This concept was developed in combination with the related theory of permanent revolution to explain the historical context of Russia. He would later elaborate on this theory to explain the specific laws of uneven development in 1930 and the conditions for a possible revolutionary scenario.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cultures of Uneven and Combined Development: From International Relations to World Literature |date=8 July 2019 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-38473-6 |pages=1–20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMqiDwAAQBAJ&q=Trotsky+uneven+and+combined+development |language=en}}</ref> According to biographer Ian Thatcher, this theory would be later generalised to "the entire history of mankind".<ref>"Talk of uneven development becomes dominant in Trotskii's writings from 1927 onwards.

Thatcher]], "Uneven and combined development", ''Revolutionary Russia'', Vol. 4 No. 2, 1991, p. 237.</ref>

Political scientists Emanuele Saccarelli and Latha Varadarajan valued his theory as a "signal contribution" to the discipline of [[international relations]]. They argued his theory presented "a specific understanding of capitalist development as 'uneven', insofar as it systematically featured geographically divergent 'advanced' and 'backward' regions" across the [[world economy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Saccarelli |first1=Emanuele |last2=Varadarajan |first2=Latha |title=Leon Trotsky and the political conundrum of international relations |journal=Global Social Challenges Journal |date=7 June 2023 |volume=-1 |issue=aop |pages=105–126 |doi=10.1332/CBXB8720 |url=https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/gsc/configurable/content/journals$002fgscj$002faop$002farticle-10.1332-CBXB8720$002farticle-10.1332-CBXB8720.xml |language=en|doi-access=free }}</ref>

In ''[[Literature and Revolution]]'', Trotsky examined aesthetic issues in relation to class and the Russian revolution.

Trotsky presented a critique of contemporary literary movements such as [[Futurism]] and emphasised a need of cultural autonomy for the development of a socialist culture. According to literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]], Trotsky recognised "like Lenin on the need for a socialist culture to absorb the finest products of bourgeois art".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eagleton |first1=Terry |title=Marxism and Literary Criticism |date=7 March 2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-94783-6 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7k8t09BbIQC&q=trotsky+literature+and+revolution+socialist+realism |language=en}}</ref> Trotsky himself viewed the proletarian culture as "temporary and transitional" which would provide the foundations for a culture above classes. He also argued that the pre-conditions for artistic creativity were economic well-being and emancipation from material constraints.<ref name="Oxford Eng. : Clarendon Press">{{cite book |last1=Knei-Paz |first1=Baruch |title=The social and political thought of Leon Trotsky |date=1978 |location=Oxford [Eng.] |publisher= Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-827233-5 |pages=289–301 |url=https://archive.org/details/socialpoliticalt0000knei/page/300/mode/2up?q=proletarian+culture}}</ref>

Political scientist Baruch Knei-Paz characterised [[The Social and Political Thought of Leon Trotsky|his view]] on the role of the party as transmitters of culture to the masses and raising the standards of education, as well as entry into the cultural sphere, but that the process of artistic creation in terms of language and presentation should be the domain of the practitioner.
