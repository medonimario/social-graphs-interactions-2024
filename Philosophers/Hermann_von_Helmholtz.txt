'''Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|l|m| |h|oʊ|l|t|s}}; {{IPA|de|ˈhɛʁ.man vɔn ˈhɛlmˌhɔlts|lang}}; 31 August 1821 – 8 September 1894; "von" since 1883) was a German  [[physicist]] and [[physician]] who made significant contributions in several scientific fields, particularly [[hydrodynamic stability]].<ref>{{Cite thesis |title=Robust flow stability: Theory, computations and experiments in near-wall turbulence |url=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PhDT.......158B |date=1 January 2004 |first=Kumar Manoj |last=Bobba|bibcode=2004PhDT.......158B }}</ref> The [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres|Helmholtz Association]], the largest German association of [[research institution]]s, is named in his honour.<ref name="Gemeinschaft">{{Cite web |title=The polymath with a sense of practice |url=https://www.helmholtz.de/en/about-us/who-we-are/history/hermann-von-helmholtz/ |access-date=2024-10-04 |website=Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft Deutscher Forschungszentren}}</ref>

In the fields of [[physiology]] and [[psychology]], Helmholtz is known for his mathematics concerning the [[Human eye|eye]], [[Theory of vision|theories of vision]], ideas on the [[visual perception]] of space, [[colour vision]] research, the sensation of tone, perceptions of sound, and [[empiricism]] in the physiology of perception. In [[physics]], he is known for his theories on the conservation of [[energy]] and on the electrical [[Double layer (surface science)|double layer]], work in [[electrodynamics]], [[chemical thermodynamics]], and on a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] foundation of [[thermodynamics]]. Although credit is shared with [[Julius von Mayer]], [[James Joule]], and [[Daniel Bernoulli]]—among others—for the energy conservation principles that eventually led to the [[first law of thermodynamics]], he is credited with the first formulation of the energy conservation principle in its maximally general form.<ref name="Patton"/>

As a [[philosopher]], he is known for his [[philosophy of science]], ideas on the relation between the laws of perception and the [[physical law|laws of nature]], the science of [[aesthetics]], and ideas on the civilizing power of science. By the late nineteenth century, Helmholtz's development of a broadly Kantian methodology, including the ''a priori'' determination of the manifold of possible orientations in perceptual space, had inspired new readings of Kant<ref name="Patton"/> and contributed to the late modern [[Neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantianism]] movement in philosophy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entrieS/neo-kantianism/ |title=Neo-Kantianism |last=Heis |first=Jeremy |date=2018 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=6 October 2024 |quote=This movement drew inspiration from a diverse cast of philosophers—principally, Kuno Fischer (Fischer 1860), Hermann von Helmholtz (Helmholtz 1867, 1878), Friedrich Lange (Lange 1866), Otto Liebmann (Liebmann 1865), and Eduard Zeller (Zeller 1862))—who in the middle of the nineteenth century were calling for a return to Kant’s philosophy as an alternative to both speculative metaphysics and materialism (Beiser 2014b).}}</ref>

== Biography ==

===Early years===

Helmholtz was born in [[Potsdam]], the son of the local [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] headmaster, Ferdinand Helmholtz, who had studied [[classical philology]] and [[philosophy]], and who was a close friend of the publisher and philosopher [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]]. Helmholtz's work was influenced by the philosophy of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. He tried to trace their theories in empirical matters like [[physiology]].

As a young man, Helmholtz was interested in natural science, but his father wanted him to study medicine. Helmholtz earned a [[medical doctorate]] at Medicinisch-chirurgisches Friedrich-Wilhelm-Institute in 1842 and served a one-year internship at the [[Charité]] hospital<ref>R. S. Turner, ''In the Eye's Mind: Vision and the Helmholtz-Hering Controversy'', Princeton University Press, 2014, p. 36.</ref> (because there was financial support for medical students).

Trained primarily in physiology, Helmholtz wrote on many other topics, ranging from theoretical physics to the [[age of the Earth]], and to the origin of the [[Solar System]].

===University posts===

Helmholtz's first academic position was as a teacher of anatomy at the Academy of Arts in Berlin in 1848.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf|access-date=21 October 2016|archive-date=24 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124115814/http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> He then moved to take a post of associate professor of physiology at the Prussian [[University of Königsberg]], where he was appointed in 1849. In 1855 he accepted a full professorship of anatomy and physiology at the [[University of Bonn]]. He was not particularly happy in Bonn, however, and three years later he transferred to the [[University of Heidelberg]], in [[Baden]], where he served as professor of physiology. In 1871 he accepted his final university position, as professor of physics at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin.

[[File:Helmholtz 1848.jpg|thumb|upright|Helmholtz in 1848]]

===Mechanics===

His first important scientific achievement, an 1847 treatise on the [[conservation of energy]], was written in the context of his medical studies and philosophical background. His work on energy conservation came about while studying [[muscle]] [[metabolism]]. He tried to demonstrate that no energy is lost in muscle movement, motivated by the implication that there were no ''vital forces'' necessary to move a muscle. This was a rejection of the speculative tradition of ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' and [[vitalism]] which was at that time a dominant philosophical paradigm in German physiology. He was working against the argument, promoted by some vitalists, that "living force" can power a machine indefinitely.<ref name="Patton">[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermann-helmholtz/?simple=True Patton, Lydia. "Hermann von Helmholtz." (2008), Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.]</ref>

Drawing on the earlier work of [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], [[Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron]] and [[James Prescott Joule]], he postulated a relationship between [[mechanics]], [[heat]], [[light]], [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] by treating them all as manifestations of a single ''force'', or [[energy]] in today's terminology. He published his theories in his book ''Über die Erhaltung der Kraft'' (''On the Conservation of Force'', 1847).<ref>English translation published in ''Scientific memoirs, selected from the transactions of foreign academies of science, and from foreign journals: Natural philosophy'' (1853), p. 114; trans. by John Tyndall.

In the 1850s and 60s, building on the publications of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], Helmholtz and [[William Rankine]] helped popularize the idea of the [[heat death of the universe]].

In fluid dynamics, Helmholtz made several contributions, including [[Helmholtz's theorems]] for vortex dynamics in inviscid fluids.<gallery>

===Sensory physiology===

Helmholtz was a pioneer in the scientific study of human vision and audition. Inspired by [[psychophysics]], he was interested in the relationships between measurable physical stimuli and their correspondent human perceptions. For example, the amplitude of a sound wave can be varied, causing the sound to appear louder or softer, but a linear step in sound pressure amplitude does not result in a linear step in perceived loudness. The physical sound needs to be increased exponentially in order for equal steps to seem linear, a fact that is used in current electronic devices to control volume. Helmholtz paved the way in experimental studies on the relationship between the physical energy (physics) and its appreciation (psychology), with the goal in mind to develop "psychophysical laws".

The sensory physiology of Helmholtz was the basis of the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]], a student of Helmholtz, who is considered one of the founders of experimental [[psychology]]. More explicitly than Helmholtz, Wundt described his research as a form of empirical philosophy and as a study of the mind as something separate. Helmholtz had, in his early repudiation of [[Naturphilosophie]], stressed the importance of [[materialism]], and was focusing more on the unity of "mind" and body.<ref>{{Cite book| title = Making Modern Science: A Historical Survey | author = Peter J. Bowler and Iwan Rhys Morus | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 2005 | page = 177 | isbn = 978-0-226-06861-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LEl3s-wYg10C&q=Helmholtz+materialism++sensory+nineteenth-century+Naturphilosophie&pg=PA177 }}</ref>

===Ophthalmic optics===

In 1851, Helmholtz revolutionized the field of [[ophthalmology]] with the invention of the [[ophthalmoscope]]; an instrument used to examine the inside of the [[human eye]]. This made him world-famous overnight. Helmholtz's interests at that time were increasingly focused on the physiology of the senses. His main publication, titled ''Handbuch der Physiologischen Optik'' (''Handbook of Physiological Optics'' or ''Treatise on Physiological Optics''; English translation of the 3rd volume [https://web.archive.org/web/20180320133752/http://poseidon.sunyopt.edu/BackusLab/Helmholtz/ here]), provided empirical theories on [[depth perception]], [[colour vision]], and [[motion perception]], and became the fundamental reference work in his field during the second half of the nineteenth century. In the third and final volume, published in 1867, Helmholtz described the importance of [[unconscious inference]]s for perception. The ''Handbuch'' was first translated into English under the editorship of [[James P. C. Southall]] on behalf of the [[Optical Society of America]] in 1924–5. His theory of [[accommodation reflex|accommodation]] went unchallenged until the final decade of the 20th century.

Helmholtz continued to work for several decades on several editions of the handbook, frequently updating his work because of his dispute with [[Ewald Hering]] who held opposite views on spatial and colour vision. This dispute divided the discipline of physiology during the second half of the 1800s.

===Nerve physiology===

In 1849, while at Königsberg, Helmholtz measured the speed at which the signal is carried along a nerve fibre. At that time most people believed that nerve signals passed along nerves immeasurably fast.<ref name="glynn">{{cite book |last1=Glynn |first1=Ian |title=Elegance in Science|year=2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-957862-7|pages=147–150 }}</ref> He used a recently dissected sciatic nerve of a frog and the calf muscle to which it attached. He used a [[galvanometer]] as a sensitive timing device, attaching a mirror to the needle to reflect a light beam across the room to a scale which gave much greater sensitivity.<ref name="glynn"/> Helmholtz reported<ref>Helmholtz, Hermann von (1850).''Vorläufiger Bericht über die Fortpflanzungs-Geschwindigkeit der Nervenreizung''.

===Acoustics and aesthetics===
[[File:Hermann von Helmholtz-2.jpg|thumb|Last photograph of von Helmholtz, taken three days before his final illness]] [[File:Helmholtz resonator 2.jpg|right|thumb|The Helmholtz resonator (''i'') and instrumentation]]

In 1863, Helmholtz published ''[[Sensations of Tone]]'', once again demonstrating his interest in the physics of perception. This book influenced musicologists into the twentieth century. Helmholtz invented the [[Helmholtz resonance|Helmholtz resonator]] to identify the various [[audio frequency|frequencies]] or [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] of the pure [[sine wave]] components of [[Fourier analysis#Applications in signal processing|complex sounds containing multiple tones]].<ref name="Helmholtz1885">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/onsensationston00unkngoog |last=von Helmholtz |first=Hermann |year=1885 |title=On the sensations of tone as a physiological basis for the theory of music |edition=Second English |translator-first1=Alexander J. |translator-last1= Ellis |location=London |publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/onsensationston00unkngoog/page/n69 44] |access-date=12 October 2010 }}</ref>

Helmholtz showed that different combinations of resonators could mimic [[vowel]] sounds: [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in particular was interested in this but, not being able to read German, misconstrued Helmholtz's diagrams as meaning that Helmholtz had transmitted multiple frequencies by wire—which would allow multiplexing of telegraph signals—whereas, in reality, electrical power was used only to keep the resonators in motion. Bell failed to reproduce what he thought Helmholtz had done but later said that, had he been able to read German, he would not have gone on to invent the telephone on the [[harmonic telegraph]] principle.<ref>{{cite web | title = PBS, American Experience: The Telephone – More About Bell | website = [[PBS]]| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/telephone/peopleevents/mabell.html}}</ref><ref name="MacKenzie2008">MacKenzie 2003, p. 41.</ref><ref>Groundwater 2005, p. 31.</ref><ref>Shulman 2008, pp. 46–48.</ref>

===Electromagnetism===

Helmholtz studied the phenomena of electrical oscillations from 1869 to 1871, and in a lecture delivered to the Naturhistorisch-medizinischen Vereins zu Heidelberg (Natural History and Medical Association of Heidelberg) on 30 April 1869, titled ''On Electrical Oscillations'' he indicated that the perceptible damped electrical oscillations in a coil joined up with a [[Leyden jar]] were about 1/50th of a second in duration.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCNWAAAAMAAJ&q=electrical+oscillation+helmholtz&pg=PA268|title=Hermann von Helmholtz|first=Leo|last=Koenigsberger|date=28 March 2018|publisher=Clarendon press|isbn=978-0-486-21517-4|access-date=28 March 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>

In 1871, Helmholtz moved from Heidelberg to Berlin to become a professor of physics. He became interested in [[electromagnetism]], and the [[Helmholtz equation]] is named for him. Although he did not make major contributions to this field, his student [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]] became famous as the first to demonstrate [[electromagnetic radiation]]. [[Oliver Heaviside]] criticised Helmholtz's electromagnetic theory because it allowed the existence of [[longitudinal wave]]s. Based on work on [[Maxwell's equations]], Heaviside pronounced that longitudinal waves could not exist in a vacuum or a homogeneous medium. Heaviside did not note, however, that longitudinal electromagnetic waves can exist at a boundary or in an enclosed space.<ref>John D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, {{ISBN|0-471-30932-X}}.</ref>

==Philosophy==

Helmholtz scientific work in physiology and mechanics occasioned much that he is known for in [[philosophy of science]], including ideas on the relation between the laws of perception and the [[physical law|laws of nature]] and his rejection of the exclusive use of [[Euclidean_geometry|Euclidean geometry]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Helmholtz |first1=Hermann von |date=1977 |title=On the origin and significance of the axioms of geometry |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-94-010-1115-0_1?pdf=chapter%20toc |journal=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science |volume=37 |issue= |pages=1–38 |doi= 10.1007/978-94-010-1115-0_1|isbn=978-90-277-0582-2 |access-date=13 October 2024}}</ref>

His philosophy of science wavered between some version of [[empiricism]] and [[transcendentalism]].<ref>{{cite journal

His rejection of Euclidean geometry as the only possible science of space is central to understanding his appropriation of Kant's philosophy of space, which ostensibly requires Euclidean geometry to be that exclusive ''a priori'' science of [[physical space]]. Helmholtz introduced a new conception of the ''a priori'' in space: that of the determination of the manifold of possible orientations in perceptual space. These developments inspired new readings of Kant<ref name="Patton"/> and contributed to the rise of late modern [[Neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantianism]] movement in philosophy.

== Students and associates ==

Other students and research associates of Helmholtz at Berlin included [[Max Planck]], [[Heinrich Kayser]], [[Eugen Goldstein]], [[Wilhelm Wien]], [[Arthur König]], [[Henry Augustus Rowland]], [[Albert A. Michelson]], [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[Fernando Sanford]] and [[Michael I. Pupin]]. [[Leo Koenigsberger]], who was his colleague from 1869 to 1871 in Heidelberg, wrote the definitive biography of him in 1902.
