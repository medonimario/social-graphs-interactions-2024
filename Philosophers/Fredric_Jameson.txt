In 1985 he was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{citation |title=Fredric R.

===Early works===
Auerbach would prove to be a lasting influence on Jameson's thought. This was already apparent in Jameson's [[doctoral dissertation]], published in 1961 as ''Sartre: The Origins of a Style''. Auerbach's concerns were rooted in the German [[philology|philological]] tradition; his works on the history of [[literary genre|style]] analyzed literary form within [[social history]]. Jameson would follow in these steps, examining the articulation of poetry, history, [[philology]], and philosophy in the works of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who was the subject of his dissertation.<ref name = Risen/>

Jameson's work focused on the relation between the style of Sartre's writings and the political and ethical positions of his [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophy. The occasional [[Marxist philosophy|Marxian]] aspects of Sartre's work were glossed over in this book; Jameson would return to them in the following decade.{{sfn|Buchanan|2006|p=29–30}}

Jameson's dissertation, though it drew on a long tradition of European cultural analysis, differed markedly from the prevailing trends of Anglo-American academia (which were [[empiricism]] and [[logical positivism]] in philosophy and [[linguistics]], and [[New Criticism|New Critical]] [[Formalism (literature)|formalism]] in [[literary criticism]]). It nevertheless earned Jameson a position at [[Harvard University]].<ref name = Risen/>

===Research into Marxism===
His interest in Sartre led Jameson to intense study of [[Marxist literary theory]]. Even though [[Karl Marx]] was becoming an important influence in American [[social science]], partly through the influence of the many European intellectuals who had sought refuge from the [[Second World War]] in the United States, such as [[Theodor Adorno]], the literary and critical work of the [[Western Marxism|Western Marxists]] was still largely unknown in American academia in the late-1950s and early-1960s.{{sfn|Buchanan|2006|p=120}}

Jameson's shift toward Marxism was also driven by his increasing political connection with the [[New Left]] and [[pacifism|pacifist]] movements, as well as by the [[Cuban Revolution]], which Jameson took as a sign that "Marxism was alive and well as a collective movement and a culturally productive force".<ref>Fredric Jameson, "Interview with Srinivas Aramudan and Ranjanna Khanna," in ''Jameson on Jameson: Conversations on Cultural Marxism'', ed. Ian Buchanan (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2007), p. 204.</ref> His research focused on [[critical theory]]: thinkers of, and influenced by, the [[Frankfurt School]], such as [[Kenneth Burke]], [[György Lukács]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Louis Althusser]], and Sartre, who viewed cultural criticism as an integral feature of Marxist theory. In 1969, Jameson co-founded the [[Marxist Literary Group]] with a number of his graduate students at the University of California, San Diego.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlg.eserver.org/about/a-short-history-of-the-mlg |last=Homer |first=Sean |title=A Short History of the MLG |website=MLG |access-date=February 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308092210/http://mlg.eserver.org/about/a-short-history-of-the-mlg |archive-date=March 8, 2012 }}</ref>

While the [[Orthodox Marxist]] view of ideology held that the cultural "[[base and superstructure|superstructure]]" was completely [[economic determinism|determined]] by the [[infrastructure|economic "base"]], the Western Marxists critically analyzed culture as a historical and social phenomenon alongside economic production and distribution or political power relationships. They held that culture must be studied using the [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] concept of [[immanent critique]]: the theory that adequate description and criticism of a philosophical or cultural text must be carried out in the same terms that text itself employs, in order to develop its internal inconsistencies in a manner that allows intellectual advancement. Marx highlighted immanent critique in his early writings, derived from Hegel's development of a new form of dialectical thinking that would attempt, as Jameson comments, "to lift itself mightily up by its own bootstraps".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jameson |first1=Fredric |title=Marxism and Form |year=1974 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01311-4 |url=https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691013114/marxism-and-form |access-date=October 23, 2020}}</ref>

===Narrative and history===
History came to play an increasingly central role in Jameson's interpretation of both the reading (consumption) and writing (production) of [[literary text]]s. Jameson marked his full-fledged commitment to [[Hegelian]]-[[Marxist philosophy]] with the publication of ''The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act,'' the opening slogan of which is "always historicize" (1981).<ref name = Risen/> ''The Political Unconscious'' takes as its object not the literary text itself, but rather the interpretive frameworks by which it is now constructed. As [[Jonathan Culler]] has observed, ''The Political Unconscious'' emerged as an alternative method to interpret literary narratives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801492228/the-political-unconscious/#bookTabs=1|title=The Political Unconscious by Fredric Jameson &#124; Paperback}}</ref>

The book's argument emphasized history as the "ultimate horizon" of [[literary analysis|literary]] and [[cultural analysis]]. It borrowed notions from the structuralist tradition and from [[Raymond Williams]]'s work in [[cultural studies]], and joined them to a largely Marxist view of [[labour (economics)|labor]] (whether blue-collar or intellectual) as the focal point of analysis. Jameson's readings exploited both the explicit formal and thematic choices of the writer and the unconscious framework guiding these. Artistic choices that were ordinarily viewed in purely [[aesthetic]] terms were recast in terms of historical literary practices and norms, in an attempt to develop a systematic inventory of the constraints they imposed on the artist as an individual creative subject. To further this meta-commentary, Jameson described the ''ideologeme'', or "the smallest intelligible unit of the essentially antagonistic collective discourses of social classes", the smallest legible residue of the real-life, ongoing struggles occurring between social classes.<ref>Jameson, Fredric.  ''The Political Unconscious:  Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act.''  Ithaca, NY:  Cornell UP, 1982., p. 76</ref>{{NoteTag|The term "ideologeme" was first used by [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] and [[Pavel Nikolaevich Medvedev]] in their work ''The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship'' and was later popularised by [[Julia Kristeva]]. Kristeva defined it as "the intersection of a given textual arrangement ... with the utterances ... that it either assimilates into its own space or to which it refers in the space of exterior texts ...".<ref>[[Julia Kristeva|Kristeva, Julia]]. "Desire in Language: A Semiotic Approach to Literature and Art". Ed. [[Leon Samuel Roudiez|Leon S. Roudiez]]. Trans. Thomas Gora, [[Alice Jardine]], and Leon S. Roudiez. New York: Columbia UP, 1980. pp. 2, 36.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>}}

Jameson's establishment of history as the only pertinent factor in this analysis, which derived the categories governing artistic production from their historical framework, was paired with a bold theoretical claim. His book claimed to establish Marxian literary criticism, centered in the notion of an artistic [[mode of production]], as the most all-inclusive and comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding literature.<ref>Fredric Jameson, ''The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act'', Ithaca, NY: [[Cornell University Press]], 1981, p. 10</ref> According to Vincent B. Leitch, the publication of ''The Political Unconscious'' "rendered Jameson the leading Marxist literary critic in America."{{sfn|Leitch|2010|p=325}}

===Analysis of postmodernism===
{{Main|Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism}}
====Background====
It is Jameson’s contribution to a conception and analysis of  ''postmodernism'' that has had the most impact in its breadth and reach.<ref name="Greif">{{citation |last=Greif |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Greif |title=Glimmers of Totality: Fredric Jameson at Ninety |magazine=[[Harper's Magazine]] |issue=9 |year=2024 |url=https://harpers.org/archive/2024/09/glimmers-of-totality-mark-greif-frederic-jameson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240819180215/https://harpers.org/archive/2024/09/glimmers-of-totality-mark-greif-frederic-jameson |archive-date=August 19, 2024}}</ref> At the time of his death in 2024, it was generally recognized that he was the preeminent critic of postmodernism.<ref name="nation"/> Jameson’s contention was that postmodernism is the cultural expression of our own current period of [[Late capitalism]].<ref>{{cite book| title = Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism| location= Durham, NC | publisher=Duke University Press| year = 1991| title-link= Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism |oclc=948832273 |isbn=8190340328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/postmodernismorc00jame_496/page/n449 438]}}</ref><ref>Felluga, Dino.[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/english/theory/marxism/modules/jamesonlatecapitalism.html "Modules on Jameson: On Late Capitalism."]''Introductory Guide to Critical Theory.''

Jameson developed this form of analysis during a time when “an art-historical debate had wondered for several years whether our age had moved beyond modern art and on to ‘postmodern’ art”.<ref name="Greif"/> Jameson joined in on the debate in 1984 with his article titled "Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism" that was first published in the journal ''[[New Left Review]]''.<ref>{{citation |last=Jameson |first=Fredric |title=Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism |journal=[[New Left Review]] |volume=I/146 |year=1984 |pages=53–92 |url=https://sites.duke.edu/criticaltheory/files/2020/01/Jameson-1984-Postmodernism-or-The-Cultural-Logic-of-Late-Capitalism-New-Left-Review-146-Jul-Aug-1984.pdf}}.</ref> He later expanded the article into a book, which he published in 1991.

====Jameson’s argument====
Jameson’s argument centered around his assertion that the various phenomena of the postmodern had been, or could have been, understood successfully within a modernist framework.<ref name="nation"/> This differed from the most prominent views of the postmodern condition that existed at that time. In Jameson’s view, postmodernity's merging of all discourse into an undifferentiated whole was the result of the colonization of the cultural sphere—which had retained at least partial autonomy during the prior modernist era—by a newly organized [[corporate capitalism]].<ref name="Kellner"/>{{NoteTag|According to [[Douglas Kellner]]: {{quote|“Following Ernest Mandel's periodization in his book Late Capitalism (1975), Jameson claims that "there have been three fundamental moments in capitalism, each one marking a dialectical expansion over the previous stage. These are market capitalism, the monopoly stage or the stage of imperialism, and our own, wrongly called postindustrial, but what might better be termed multinational, capital". To these forms of society correspond the cultural forms realism, modernism, and postmodernism.”<ref name="Kellner">{{citation |last=Kellner |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Kellner |title=Fredric Jameson |website=Douglas Kellner (professional site) |access-date=29 September 2024 |url=https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/papers/JamesonJH.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223160814/https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/papers/JamesonJH.htm |archive-date=23 December 2014}}</ref>}} }}

Following [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]]'s analysis of the [[culture industry]], Jameson discussed this phenomenon in his critical discussion of architecture, film, narrative, and visual arts, as well as in his strictly philosophical work.<ref name="Kellner"/> For Jameson, postmodernism, as a form of mass-culture driven by capitalism, pervades every aspect of our daily lives.<ref name="Greif"/>

====Key concepts====
Two of Jameson's best-known claims from ''Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism'' are that post-modernity is characterized by "[[pastiche]]" and a "crisis in [[historicity]]".<ref name="auto7">[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/english/theory/postmodernism/modules/jamesonpastiche.html "Modules on Jameson: On pastiche"]''Introductory Guide to Critical Theory.'' Purdue University. Accessed: September 28, 2024</ref> And since postmodernism —as was mentioned above —represents the form of an enormous cultural expansion into an economy of spectacle and style, rather than the production of goods,<ref name="Aviles"/> Jameson argued that parody (which implies a moral judgment or a comparison with societal norms) was replaced by pastiche ([[collage]] and other forms of juxtaposition without a normative grounding).<ref name="auto7"/> Jameson recognized that [[modernism]] frequently "quotes" from different cultures and historical periods, but he argues that [[postmodern]] cultural texts indiscriminately cannibalize these elements, erasing any sense of critical or historical distance, resulting in pure pastiche.<ref>{{citation |last=Storey |first=John |chapter=Postmodernism and Popular Culture |editor-last=Sim|editor-first=Stuart|editor-link=Stuart Sim |date=1998 |title=The Icon Critical Dictionary of Postmodern Thought |url=https://archive.org/details/iconcriticaldict0000unse_s4y3 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Icon Books|page=150|isbn=9781874166658}}</ref>

Relatedly, Jameson argues that the postmodern era suffers from a crisis in historicity: "there no longer does seem to be any organic relationship between the [...] history we learn from schoolbooks and the lived experience of the current, multinational, high-rise, [[stagflation|stagflated]] city of the newspapers and of our own everyday life".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jameson |first=Fredric |date=November 21, 2023 |title=Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism |url=https://web.education.wisc.edu/halverson/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2012/12/jameson.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230403185810/https://web.education.wisc.edu/halverson/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2012/12/jameson.pdf |archive-date=April 3, 2023 |page=69}}</ref>

Jameson's analysis of postmodernism attempts to view it as historically grounded; he therefore explicitly rejects any moralistic opposition to postmodernity as a cultural phenomenon. Instead, Jameson insists upon a Hegelian immanent critique that would "think the cultural evolution of late capitalism dialectically, as catastrophe and progress all together".<ref>Fredric Jameson, ''Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism'', Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1991, p. 47.</ref><ref name="Greif"/>

====Other concepts====
Some of Jameson's other well-known concepts and philosophical contributions —not mentioned in the preceding section or tangential to his critique of postmodernism— include the concepts of "cognitive mapping"<ref>See {{citation |last=Jameson |first=Fredric |title=Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism |journal=[[New Left Review]] |volume=146 |year=1984 |pages=53–92 |url=https://sites.duke.edu/criticaltheory/files/2020/01/Jameson-1984-Postmodernism-or-The-Cultural-Logic-of-Late-Capitalism-New-Left-Review-146-Jul-Aug-1984.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240619112911/https://sites.duke.edu/criticaltheory/files/2020/01/Jameson-1984-Postmodernism-or-The-Cultural-Logic-of-Late-Capitalism-New-Left-Review-146-Jul-Aug-1984.pdf |archive-date=June 19, 2024 }}; and {{citation |last=Jameson |first=Fredric |chapter=Cognitive Mapping |editor-first=Cary |editor-last=Nelson |editor-link=Cary Nelson |editor-first2=Lawrence |editor-last2=Grossberg |editor-link2=Lawrence Grossberg |title=Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture |location=Urbana, IL |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |year=1988 |pages=347–357 |isbn=9780252011085}}, reprinted in ''The Jameson Reader'', ed.

===Later work===
Several of Jameson’s later works, along with ''Postmodernism'', are part of what he called both a "sequence" and "project" entitled ''The Poetics of Social Forms''.<ref name="Greif"/> This project attempts, in [[Sara Danius]]'s words, to "provide a general history of aesthetic forms, at the same time seeking to show how this history can be read in tandem with a history of social and economic formations".<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.holbergprisen.no/en/fredric-r-jameson/about-fredric-r-jameson.html |last=Danius |first=Sara |author-link=Sara Danius |title=About Fredric R.

''Archaeologies of the Future'' is a study of [[utopia]] and [[science fiction]] that was launched at [[Monash University]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. ''The Antinomies of Realism'' won the 2014 [[Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://now.uiowa.edu/2014/05/fredric-jameson-receives-truman-capote-award |last=Clair |first=Christopher |title=Fredric Jameson receives Truman Capote Award |website=Iowa Now |date=May 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230803023326/https://now.uiowa.edu/news/2014/05/fredric-jameson-receives-truman-capote-award |archive-date=August 3, 2023}}</ref>

Alongside this project, Jameson published three related studies of [[dialectical materialism|dialectical theory]]: ''Valences of the Dialectic'' (2009), which includes Jameson's critical responses to [[Slavoj Žižek]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], and other contemporary theorists; ''The Hegel Variations'' (2010), a commentary on Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''; and ''Representing Capital: A Reading of Volume One'' (2011), an analysis of Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref>{{OCLC|698450477}}</ref><ref>[https://www.versobooks.com/products/2151-the-hegel-variations?srsltid=AfmBOopNKL1Wrgu1sXBcDGvnMqxmIabzcQu52TUiZQm_Tz00oqr0BWHW The Hegel Variations: ''On the Phenomenology of Spirit'' by Fredric Jameson]</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03017605.2013.776223 | doi=10.1080/03017605.2013.776223 | title=Fredric Jameson: ''Representing Capital: A Reading of Volume One'' | date=2013 | last1=Eres | first1=Benan | journal=[[Critique: Journal of Socialist Theory|Critique]] | volume=41 | pages=129–135 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Carp |first=Alex |title=On Fredric Jameson |journal=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] |date=March 5, 2014 |url=http://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/03/on-fredric-jameson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220628095838/https://jacobin.com/2014/03/on-fredric-jameson |archive-date=June 28, 2022}}</ref>

An overview of Jameson's work, ''Fredric Jameson: Live Theory,'' by [[Ian Buchanan (academic)|Ian Buchanan]], was published in 2007.

===Personal life and death===

Jameson was married to Susan Willis, and had three daughters.<ref name = Risen/> He died at his home in [[Killingworth, Connecticut]], on September 22, 2024, at the age of 90.<ref name = Risen/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ross |first1=Alex |author-link=Alex Ross (music critic) |title=For Fredric Jameson |url=https://www.therestisnoise.com/2024/09/for-fredric-jameson.html |website=The Rest is Noise |access-date=September 22, 2024 |date=September 22, 2024}}</ref>
===Recognition, influence, and legacy===
====MLA awards and honors====
The [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA) recognized Jameson throughout his career. In 1971, Jameson earned the MLA’s [[William Riley Parker Prize]].<ref name="auto1"/> Twenty years later, it awarded him its 1991 James Russell Lowell Prize for ''Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mla.org/Resources/Career/MLA-Grants-and-Awards/Winners-of-MLA-Prizes/Annual-Prize-and-Award-Winners/James-Russell-Lowell-Prize-Winners|title=James Russell Lowell Prize Winners|website=Modern Language Association}}</ref>

====Holberg International Memorial Prize====
In 2008, Jameson was awarded the annual [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]] in recognition of his career-long research "on the relation between social formations and cultural forms".<ref>{{cite news |title=Professor Fredric R.

====Lyman Tower Sargent Distinguished Scholar Award====
In 2009, Jameson was awarded the [[Lyman Tower Sargent]] Distinguished Scholar Award by the North American [[Society for Utopian Studies]].<ref name="auto2"/> Jameson was given credit for his ”significant role in introducing to an English reading audience the rich theorizations of Utopia found in German critical theory, in works written by [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and most significantly, [[Ernst Bloch]].” It was also noted that “the question of Utopia is central to all of Jameson’s work.”<ref name="auto2"/>

====Influence in China====
Jameson has had an influence on the theorization of the postmodern in China. In mid-1985, shortly after the beginning of the cultural fever (early 1985 to the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre|1989 Tiananmen Square massacre]])—a period in [[Chinese intellectualism|Chinese intellectual history]] characterized in part by intense interest in Western [[critical theory]], [[literary theory]], and related disciplines<ref name=ZhangXudong>{{Cite journal | last = Zhang | first = Xudong | title = On some motifs in the Chinese "Cultural Fever" of the late 1980s: social change, ideology, and theory | journal = [[Social Text]] | volume = 39 | issue =  39| pages = 129–156 | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/466367 | jstor = 466367 | date =Summer 1994 }}</ref>—Jameson discussed the idea of postmodernism in China in lectures at [[Peking University]] and the newly founded [[Shenzhen University]].<ref name=WangChaohua>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LPE541jyjfgC&pg=PA9|title=One China, Many Paths|first=Chaohua|last=Wang|date=May 17, 2005|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-84467-535-7 |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=WangNing>[[Wang Ning (linguist)|Wang Ning]].

In 1987, Jameson published a book entitled ''Postmodernism and Cultural Theories.''{{NoteTag|({{zh|s=后现代主义与文化理论|p=''Hòuxiàndàizhǔyì yǔ wénhuà lǐlùn''}}), translated into Chinese by Tang Xiaobing.}} Although the Chinese intelligentsia's engagement with postmodernism would not begin in earnest until the nineties, ''Postmodernism and Cultural Theories'' was to become a keystone text in that engagement; as scholar [[Wang Ning (linguist)|Wang Ning]] writes, its influence on Chinese thinkers would be impossible to overestimate.<ref name=WangNing/>{{NoteTag|Its popularity may be partially due to the fact that it was not written in a dense style and so it was possible to use the text as both praise and/or criticism of the Chinese manifestation of postmodernity.<ref name=WangNing/>}}{{NoteTag|However, in [[Chaohua Wang|Wang Chaohua]]'s interpretation of events, Jameson's work was mostly used to support and praise, and therefore amounted to a fundamental misreading of Jameson:

<blockquote>The caustic edge of Jameson's theory, which had described postmodernism as "the cultural logic of late capitalism", was abandoned for a contented or even enthusiastic endorsement of mass culture, which [a certain group of Chinese critics] saw as a new space of popular freedom. According to these critics, intellectuals, who conceived of themselves as the bearers of modernity, were reacting with shock and anxiety at their loss of control with the arrival of postmodern consumer society, uttering cries of "quixotic hysteria", panic-stricken by the realization of what they had once called for during the eighties.<ref name=WangChaohua/></blockquote>}}

This debate over postmodernism, in part fueled by Jameson, was at its most intense from 1994 to 1997, carried on by Chinese intellectuals both inside and outside the mainland; particularly important contributions came from Zhao Yiheng in London, Xu Ben in the United States, and Zhang Xudong, also in the United States, who had gone on to study under Jameson as a doctoral student at [[Duke University|Duke]].<ref name=WangChaohua/>

====Legacy====
In 2011, [[Rey Chow]], then chair of Duke University's literature program, reflected on Jameson's career on the occasion of presenting him with a lifetime achievement award:

{{Quote|One would be hard put to find a humanities scholar who is more widely visible and more frequently cited across the disciplines, and who has sustained national and international critical attention for a more extended period of time than Fred Jameson<ref name="auto1"/>}} 

Robert T. Tally Jr.'s review for ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' of the 2024 work ''Inventions of a Present: The Novel in Its Crisis of Globalization'' described Jameson as:

{{Quote|at the height of his powers, carving out his novel alternative&nbsp;... [and that]&nbsp;... for over five decades, Fredric Jameson has been the leading Marxist literary and cultural critic in the United States, if not the world<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jacobin.com/2024/09/fredric-jameson-marxism-literature-theory |last=Tally |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Tally |title=How Fredric Jameson Remade Literary Criticism |website=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] |date=September 3, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240903153958/https://jacobin.com/2024/09/fredric-jameson-marxism-literature-theory |archive-date=September 3, 2024}}</ref>}}

A memorial piece published by the editorial team of the Marxist journal [[Historical_Materialism_(journal)|''Historical Materialism: Research in Critical Marxist Theory'']] described Jameson as an "intellectual giant" responsible for an "enduring legacy that has inspired generations of thinkers, activists and scholars".<ref name="auto"/> They praised Jameson for his "militant commitment to a materialist reading of moments of struggle and revolt, utopia and liberation in cultural texts."<ref name="auto"/>

Another memorial essay in ''[[The Nation]]'' observed that Jameson has emerged as a figure who "not only amassed one of the most impressive bodies of work within his field but who also was, fundamentally, someone who believed in criticism as a discourse, between teacher and pupil, between the work and the public".<ref name="nation"/>
