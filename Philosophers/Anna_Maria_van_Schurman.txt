Van Schurman was born in [[Cologne]], at the time part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a daughter of wealthy parents, Frederik van Schurman, from Antwerp (d. 1623) and Eva von Harff de Dreiborn. At four years old she could [[Reading|read]].<ref>[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0149.htm Anna Maria Schuurmans biography] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]</ref> When she was six, she had mastered creating highly intricate paper cut-outs that surpassed every other child's her age. At the age of ten, she learned embroidery in three hours. In some of her writings, she talks about how she invented the technique of [[Wax sculpture|sculpting in wax]], saying, "I had to discover many things which nobody was able to teach me." Her self-portrait wax sculpture was so lifelike, especially the necklace, that her friend, the Princess of Nassau, had to prick one with a pin just to be sure it was not real.<ref name="Honig, Elizabeth Alice 2001">Honig, Elizabeth Alice.

Woman's Art Journal 22, no. 2 (2001): 31-39. doi:10.2307/1358900.</ref> Between 1613 and 1615, her family moved to [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and about ten years later they moved again, this time to [[Franeker]] in Friesland, where she lived in the [[Martenahuis]]. From about 11 years old, Schurman was taught Latin and other subjects by her father along with his sons, an unusual decision at a time when girls in noble families were not generally tutored in the classics.<ref name="Anna Maria van Schurman">[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/71389 Anna Maria van Schurman] in the [[RKD]]</ref> To learn Latin she was given [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] to read by her father. The private education and self-study were complemented through correspondence and discussions with notables such as [[André Rivet]] and [[Friedrich Spanheim]], both professors of [[Leiden University]], and the family's neighbour [[Gisbertus Voetius]], a professor at the [[University of Utrecht]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women Writing Latin: Early Modern Women Writing Latin |publisher=Routledge|date= 2014|author1=Laurie J.

Another art form that she experimented with was [[calligraphy]], which she learned just from looking at a model-book. Once she mastered that, she invented styles that allowed her to write in many of the languages she knew.<ref name="Honig, Elizabeth Alice 2001"/> After her father's death, the family moved back to Utrecht in 1626.<ref name="Anna Maria van Schurman"/> In her 20s, Schurman's home became a meeting point for intellectuals. Among her friends were [[Constantijn Huygens]], [[Johan van Beverwijck]], [[Jacob de Witt]], [[Cornelius Boy]], [[Margaretha van Godewijk]] and [[c:Category:Utricia Ogle|Utricia Ogle]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Republic of Women: Rethinking the Republic of Letters in the Seventeenth Century |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date= 2012|author=Carol Pal|isbn=9781139510752|pages=60}}</ref> In the 1630s she studied engraving with [[Magdalena van de Passe]].<ref name="Anna Maria van Schurman"/> Combining the techniques of engraving with her skills in calligraphy, her renowned engraved calligraphy pieces gained the attention of all who saw them, including her contemporaries.<ref>Moore, Cornelia Niekus.

Canadian Journal of Netherlandic Studies 11, no. 32 (1990): n5.</ref> Despite her playfulness and experimentation, Anna Maria was very serious about her art, and her contemporaries knew it. She herself said that she was "immensely gifted by God in the arts."<ref name="Honig, Elizabeth Alice 2001"/>

In 1634, due to her distinction in Latin, she was invited to write a poem for the opening of the [[University of Utrecht]]. In the poem she celebrated the city of Utrecht and the new university. She noted the potential for the university to help the city cope with the economic impacts of the floods and the shifting course of the river [[Rhine]]. She also challenged the exclusion of women from the university. In response to her complaint, the university authorities allowed her to attend professor Voetius' lectures.<ref name="Routledge">{{Cite book|title = Women Writing Latin: Early Modern Women Writing Latin |publisher=Routledge|date= 2014|author1=Laurie J.

By the 1640s she was fluent in 14 languages and wrote in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, French, Arabic, Persian, Ethiopian, German and Dutch.<ref name="Routledge"/>

According to her contemporary Pierre Yvon, Schurman had an excellent command of mathematics, geography and astronomy. The pious young scholar appears to have had a number of suitors. After his wife died in 1631, [[Constantijn Huygens]] asked for Schurman's hand in marriage and wrote 10 poems in three languages to her in 1634. Huygens was teased by other Dutch intellectuals. Schurman's commitment to celibacy and her studies seemed to be unwavering. When she chose the phrase ''Amor Meus Crucifixus Est'' (''My Love Has Been Crucified'') as her motto, her intellectual friends were convinced that her choice not to marry was rooted in her piety, rather than her scholarship.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Republic of Women: Rethinking the Republic of Letters in the Seventeenth Century |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date= 2012|author=Carol Pal|isbn=9781139510752|pages=56}}</ref>

Schurman produced delicate engravings by using a diamond on glass, sculpture, wax modelling, and the carving of ivory and wood. She painted, especially portraits, becoming the first known Dutch painter to use [[pastel]] in a portrait. She gained honorary admission to the [[Guild of Saint Luke|St. Luke Guild of painters]] in 1643, signalling public recognition of her art.

Schurman corresponded with the Danish noblewoman [[Birgitte Thott]], who translated classical authors and religious writings. Thott's translation of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s philosophical works included a preface in which she argued for women's right to study. Thott stated that she translated classical works because few women were able to read Latin. Schurman publicly praised Thott and called her the "tenth Muse of the North".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women Writing Latin: Early Modern Women Writing Latin |publisher=Routledge|date= 2014|author1=Laurie J. Churchill |author2=Phyllis R. Brown |author3=Jane E. Jeffrey |isbn=9781135377564|pages=277}}</ref> Schurman through correspondence established a network of learned women across Europe. She corresponded in Latin and Hebrew with [[Dorothy Dury|Dorothea Moore]], in Greek with [[Bathsua Makin]], in French, Latin and Hebrew with [[Marie de Gournay]] and {{ill|Marie du Moulin|nl}}, in Latin and French with [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth of Bohemia]], and in Latin with [[Queen Christina of Sweden]]. A frequent topic in this correspondence was the education of women. Schurman in the correspondence expressed her admiration for educated women like [[Lady Jane Gray]] and [[Queen Elizabeth I]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women Writing Latin: Early Modern Women Writing Latin |publisher=Routledge|date= 2014|author1=Laurie J. Churchill |author2=Phyllis R. Brown |author3=Jane E. Jeffrey |isbn=9781135377564|pages=275}}</ref>

An unauthorised version of Schurman's writings on women's education was published in 1638 in Paris under the title ''Dissertatio De Ingenii Muliebris ad Doctrinam, & meliores Litteras aptitudine''. As the unauthorised collection of her writings circulated, Schurman decided to publish an authoritative Latin treatise in 1641. In 1657 the treatise was published in English under the title ''The Learned Maid or, Whether a Maid may be a Scholar''.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Reading Early Modern Women: An Anthology of Texts in Manuscript and Print, 1550-1700|publisher=Psychology Press|date= 2004|author=Melissa Smith|isbn= 9780415966467|pages=79}}</ref>

== The Labadists ==
[[File:AnnaMaria vanSchurman.jpg|thumb|Self portrait, 1633]]

In her 60s, Schurman emerged as one of the principal leaders of the [[Labadists]].<ref name="Routledge 2014 65">{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R. Larsen|date= 2014|author=Routledge|isbn=9781317180708|pages=65}}</ref> In the 1660s Schurman had become increasingly disillusioned with the [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R. Larsen|date= 2014|author=Routledge|isbn=9781317180708|pages=62}}</ref> She made the reformation of the church her goal. Along with corresponding with ministers, she travelled throughout the country and organised meetings with them. She lamented the lack of spiritual devotion and the "exhibits of the ecclesiastics" that occupied the church's pulpits.<ref name="Routledge 2014 63">{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R. Larsen|date= 2014|author=Routledge|isbn=9781317180708|pages=63}}</ref>

In 1661 Schurman's brother studied theology with the Hebrew scholar [[Johannes Buxtorf]] in Basel and learned about the defrocked French priest [[Jean de Labadie]]. He travelled to [[Geneva]] to meet him.<ref name="Routledge 2014 63"/> In 1662 he corresponded with Schurman at length about Labadie's teachings. When Labadie and a small number of followers stopped over in Utrecht on the way to [[Middelburg, Zeeland|Middelburg]], they lodged in Schurman's house. Labadie became the pastor of Middelburg, preaching [[millenarianism]], arguing for moral regeneration and that believers should live apart from unbelievers. Schurman supported him even when he was removed as a pastor. When in late 1669 Labadie settled in [[Amsterdam]] to establish a separatist church, Schurman sold her house and part of her library. She joined Labadie's sectarian community.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R. Larsen|date= 2014|author=Routledge|isbn=9781317180708|pages=64}}</ref> In March 1669 she broke with the Reformed Church when she published a 10-page pamphlet ''On the Reformation necessary at present in the Church of Christ''. She denounced the church men for trampling on "celestial wisdom", arguing that the people of God should be separated from the "mondains" through "hatred of the world" and "divine love".<ref name="Routledge 2014 65"/>

A public smear campaign followed. Schurman was attacked by her intellectual friends, including Huygens and Voetius. Her writing style became forthright and confident. When the Labadists had to leave Amsterdam, Schurman secured an invitation from her friend [[Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], who in 1667 had become abbess at the [[Lutheran]] ''Damenstift'' of [[Herford Abbey]]. The 50 Labadists lived there between 1670 and 1672. At Herdford Schurman continued her art work and the Labadists maintained a printing press. Schurman was referred to by the Labadists as ''Mama'', Labadie as ''Papa''. Rumours had it that Labadie and Schurman had married; however, he married Lucia van Sommelsdijck. In 1672 the Labadists moved to [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] in [[Denmark]], as Elisabeth of Bohemia had advocated on their behalf in correspondence with the King of Denmark. In 1673 Schurman published ''Eukleria, or Choosing the Better Part'', a reference to Luke 10:42 when Mary chooses the better part by sitting at the feet of Christ.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R. Larsen|date= 2014|author=Routledge|isbn=9781317180708|pages=66}}</ref> In it she derided [[Gisbertus Voetius]]'s opposition to her admiration for [[Saint Paula]], a disciple of [[St Jerome]], who had helped to translate the [[Bible]] into [[Latin]]. Voetius argued that women should have a limited public role and that anything else was feminine impropriety.<ref name="Routledge 2014 63"/> ''Eukleria'' was well received by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and prominent pietists, including [[Johann Jacob Schütz]], [[Philipp Jakob Spener]] and {{Ill|Eleonore van Merlau|de|Johanna Eleonora Petersen}}.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R. Larsen|date= 2014|author=Routledge|isbn=9781317180708|pages=66–67}}</ref>

When Labadie died in 1674, Schurman investigated the possibility of moving to [[England]], corresponding with the Latin scholar [[Lucy Hutchinson]] and the theologian [[John Owen (theologian)|John Owen]] on the matter. But the Labadists moved to the village Wieuwerd in [[Friesland]] and attracted numerous new members, including [[Maria Sibylla Merian]]. About 400 Labadists practiced absolute detachment from worldly values. They attempted to return to early church practices, sharing all property. In the final years of her life Schurman was housebound due to severe [[rheumatism]]. She continued to write, keeping up correspondence and working on the second part of ''Eukleria''. She died aged 70 in 1678.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R.

== Published writings ==
[[File:1659 van Schurman Learned Maid.jpg|thumb|The title page and frontispiece of van Schurman's ''The learned maid'', printed in 1659.]]

Many of Schurman's writings were published during her lifetime in multiple editions, although some of her writings have been lost. Her most famous book was the ''Nobiliss. Virginis Annae Mariae a Schurman Opuscula Hebraea Graeca Latina et Gallica, Prosaica et Metrica'' (''Minor works in Hebrew, Greek, Latin and French in prose and poetry by the most noble Anne Maria van Schurman''). It was published 1648 by [[Friedrich Spanheim]], professor of theology at [[Leiden University]] through the Leiden-based publisher [[House of Elzevir|Elzeviers]].<ref name="Routledge"/>

Schurman's ''The Learned Maid or, Whether a Maid may be a Scholar'' grew out of her correspondence on women's education with theologians and scholars across Europe. In it she advances [[Jane Grey]] as an example of the value of female education. Schurman argued that educating women in languages and the Bible would increase their love of God.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Reading Early Modern Women: An Anthology of Texts in Manuscript and Print, 1550-1700|publisher=Psychology Press|date= 2004|author=Melissa Smith|isbn= 9780415966467|pages=59}}</ref> While an increasing number of royal and wealthy families chose to educate their daughters, girls and women did not have formal access to education.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Equality and Non-Discrimination under International Law|publisher=Routledge|date= 2017|author=Stephanie Farrior|isbn= 9781351568036|pages=222}}</ref> Schurman argued that "A Maid may be a Scholar... The assertion may be proved both from the property of the form of this subject; or the rational soul: and from the very acts and effects themselves. For it is manifest that Maids do actually learn any arts and science."<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Concept of Woman|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|date= 2017|author=Sister Prudence Allen R.S.M.|isbn= 9780802868435|pages=302}}</ref> In arguing that women had rational souls she foreshadowed the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] argument for human reason, underpinning her assertion that women had a right to be educated. Schurman and [[René Descartes]] corresponded, and while they disagreed on the interpretation of the Bible they both thought that reason was central in the human identity.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Concept of Woman|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|date= 2017|author=Sister Prudence Allen R.S.M.|isbn= 9780802868435|pages=303}}</ref>

''The Learned Maid'' included correspondence with the theologian [[André Rivet]]. In her correspondence with Rivet, Schurman explained that women such as [[Marie de Gournay]] had already proven that man and woman are equal, so she would not "bore her readers with repetition". Like Rivet, Schurman argued in ''The Learned Maid'' for education on the basis of moral grounds, because "ignorance and idleness cause vice". But Schurman also took the position that "whoever by nature has a desire for arts and science is suited to arts and science: women have this desire, therefore women are suited to arts and science". However, Schurman did not advocate for [[universal education]], or the education for women of the lower classes. She took the view that ladies of upper classes should have access to higher education. Schurman made the point that women could make a valuable contribution to society, and argued that it was also necessary for their happiness to study [[theology]], [[philosophy]] and the [[sciences]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women's History as Scientists: A Guide to the Debates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date= 2003|author=Leigh Ann Whaley|isbn= 9781576072301|pages=68}}</ref> In reference to ''The Learned Maid'', Rivet cautioned her in a letter that "although you have shown us this with grace, your persuasions are futile... You may have many admirers, but none of them agree with you."<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women's History as Scientists: A Guide to the Debates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date= 2003|author=Leigh Ann Whaley|isbn= 9781576072301|pages=69}}</ref>

When Anna Maria van Schurman demonstrated her artistic talent early on, her father sent her to study with the famous engraver, [[Magdalena van de Passe]], in the 1630s.<ref name="Anna Maria van Schurman" /> Her first known engraving was a self-portrait, created in 1633.<ref name=":1" /> She found it difficult to depict hands and thus found ways to hide them in all of her self-portraits.<ref name=":1" /> In another self-portrait engraving she created in 1640, she included the Latin inscription "Cernitis hic picta nostros in imagine vultus: si negat ars formā[m], gratia vestra dabit." This translates in English to "''See my likeness depicted in this portrait: May your favor perfect the work where art has failed."''<ref name="Anna Maria van Schurman" />
