'''Frederick Robert Tennant''' (1 September 1866 – 9 September 1957), best known as '''F. R. Tennant''' was a British theologian, [[philosopher of religion]] and author.

==Career==

Tennant studied mathematics, physics, biology, and chemistry at [[Caius College]], Cambridge (1885–89) prior to becoming a theologian. After hearing the 1889 Huxley lectures, Tennant's interest in religion grew in the 1890s ultimately leading him to prepare for ordination in the [[Church of England]].<ref>Mary Frances Thelen (1968) biography in Tennant F.R. (1903) ''The Sources of Doctrines of the Fall and Original Sin'' (Schoken: New York); Delton L. Scudder (1940) ''Tennant’s Philosophical Theology'' (Yale University Press: New Haven; Humphrey Milford: London; Oxford University Press: Oxford). Also, see the website: http://www.bautz.de/bbkl/t/tennant_f_r.shtml</ref>  While he was ordained he taught science at Newcastle-under-Lyme High School (1891–94), and became a lecturer in Theology and [[fellow]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1913.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://trinitycollegechapel.com/about/memorials/brasses/tennant/ |publisher=trinitycollegechapel.com |title= Frederick Robert Tennant}}</ref>

As an Anglican theologian, Tennant assimilated much of Huxley's lectures culminating in the 1901–1902 [[Hulsean Lectures|Hulsean]] Lecture entitled ''Origin and Propagation of Sin'' where he integrated evolutionary ideas into a Christian synthesis.<ref>Frederick R. Tennant. 1906. ''The Origin and Propagation of Sin: Being the Hulsean lectures delivered before the University of Cambridge in 1901-2''. 2nd ed. (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge).</ref>

One of Tennant's goals in his writings was an integrative synthesis of the doctrines of the fall and original sin with Huxley’s claims of conflict between [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] thought and Christianity.<ref>Brannan, D.K. (2007) Darwinism and Original Sin: Frederick R. Tennant’s Integration of Darwinian Worldviews into Christian Thought in the Nineteenth Century. ''Journal for Interdisciplinary Research on Religion and Science'' 1:187–217; Brannan, D.K. (2011) Darwinism and Original Sin: Frederick R. Tennant’s analysis of the Church Fathers’ understanding of Original Sin and an exegesis of St. Paul. ''Journal for Interdisciplinary Research on Religion and Science'' 8:139–171.</ref>

==Evolution and purpose==

Tennant believed that the existence of a god was needed to explain the alleged purposive quality of evolution. Tennant was the first theist widely known to put forward such an argument. In volume 2 of his book ''Philosophical Theology'' he says:
<blockquote>"The multitude of interwoven adaptations by which the world is constituted a theatre of life, intelligence, and morality, cannot reasonably be regarded as an outcome of mechanism, or of blind formative power, or aught but purposive intelligence."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/design/#SH1d |publisher= [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |title=Design Arguments for the Existence of God}}</ref></blockquote>

He was an advocate of [[theistic evolution]]. Tennant made an [[argument from design]] from the "quality of the evolution process".<ref>[[Ibrahim Kalin|Kalin, Ibrahim]]. (2014). ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Science, and Technology in Islam''. Oxford University Press. p. 182. {{ISBN|978-0-19-935843-4}} "Guided" or "theistic evolution is an attempt by the theistic camp to digest Darwinian revolution and integrate it in a "design" worldview. Its first proponent was Frederick Robert Tennant, who argued for design to be seen in the "quality of the evolution process" and not in terms of the functional complexity of organisms."</ref>
