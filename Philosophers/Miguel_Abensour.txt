'''Miguel Abensour''' ({{IPA|fr|abɑ̃suʁ|lang}}, 13 February 1939 – 22 April 2017) was a French philosopher specializing in [[political philosophy]].

Beginning his academic career as a professor of [[political science]] at [[University of Burgundy|Dijon]], then at the [[University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne|University of Reims]], before teaching political philosophy at the [[Paris Diderot University]] ([[Jussieu Campus|Jussieu]]), where he became [[Emeritus|emeritus professor]]. Founder and director of the [[Collection (publishing)|editorial collection]] "Critique de la politique" at Payot and president of the [[Collège international de philosophie]] from 1985 to 1987, he is generally viewed as a [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] thinker and as a theoretician of [[radical democracy]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=Birnbaum |first=Jean |date=April 25, 2017 |title=Le philosophe Miguel Abensour est mort |pages=14 |work=Le Monde |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2017/04/25/le-philosophe-miguel-abensour-est-mort_5117349_3382.html |access-date=August 8, 2023 |archive-url=}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Poirier |first=Nicholas |date=October 6, 2017 |title=Miguel Abensour, l'émancipation par l'utopie |url=https://laviedesidees.fr/Miguel-Abensour-l-emancipation-par-l-utopie.html |access-date=August 8, 2023 |journal=[[La Vie des Idées]]}}</ref><ref name=":24">{{Cite journal |last=Rouillé-Boireau |first=Monique |date=July 23, 2018 |title=Miguel Abensour, penseur libertaire |url=https://refractions.plusloin.org/?lang=fr |journal=Lignes |volume=56 |issue=Special Issue: Miguel Abensour, La sommation utopique |pages=103–14|doi=10.3917/lignes.056.0103 }}</ref>

With thinkers such as [[Claude Lefort]], [[Pierre Clastres]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], and [[Marcel Gauchet]], Abensour greatly contributed to the renewal of French political philosophy in the [[post-war]] period.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Thinking Radical Democracy: The Return to Politics in Post-War France |publisher=Toronto University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4426-2199-2 |editor-last=Breaugh |editor-first=Martin |location=Toronto |pages=3–30 |editor-last2=Holman |editor-first2=Christopher |editor-last3=Magnusson |editor-first3=Rachel |editor-last4=Mazzocchi |editor-first4=Paul |editor-last5=Penner |editor-first5=Devin}}</ref> Aware of the many [[Historiography of the French Revolution|controversies]] surrounding the legacy, history, and [[historiography]] of the [[French Revolution]] in France, he examined the contradictions of the French [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]] and commented their texts (especially [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]]). In the wake of the rediscovery of [[Karl Marx]], notably his [[Young Marx|early writings]], Abensour aimed to distinguish Marx's own thought from [[Marxism]]. After the advent of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] and the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]], the [[Italian fascism]] and against Soviet [[totalitarianism]], Abensour questioned the nature of those totalitarian experiences in which he sees the blossoming of domination and the vanishing of politics. Moreover, while several [[Politician|political leaders]] in France and worldwide have advocated for liberal democracy, Abensour emphasized the distinction between [[Representative Governance|representative government]] and democracy.

In the same spirit of [[critique]], Abensour has offered many studies on [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Emmanuel Levinas]]. He examined the history of utopia and identified in it a "new utopian spirit." Finally, Abensour has developed a conception of democracy that he refers to as "insurgent democracy." This complex idea, akin to other theories of radical democracy, insists on the dissolution of the [[State (polity)|State]]-form and political domination as the authentic democratic moment per excellence.

Whether in his work as an editor, as a thinker, or as a public intellectual, Miguel Abensour always reflected on the [[emancipation]] of the oppressed. Acting as the guiding thread of his thought, the question posed by [[Étienne de La Boétie]] never left him: "why does the majority of the oppressed not revolt?" Eventually, he reframed this fundamental question with the terms set by [[Baruch Spinoza]]: "why do men fight for their servitude as if it were for their own salvation?"

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Born in February 1939 to parents who came to France from [[Algeria]] only a few months before the beginning of [[World War II]], Abensour had to live in hiding during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Occupation]], as his father was Jewish.<ref name=":0" /> The family left Paris and settled in a village in the [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Lower Pyrénées]]. Reflecting on this period of his life in a lengthy interview conducted by Michel Enaudeau, he stated:
{{Quote|text=We lived in a small village, and my parents had pointed out to me the houses that we had to avoid and the people not to talk to. It's undoubtedly extremely unsettling for a child to realize that the world in which they live every day is divided in two and includes dangerous places and people.|author=Miguel Abensour|title=La Communauté politique des "tous uns"|source=p. 12 [translation]}}
After the war, his father worked as a German [[Language interpretation|interpreter]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. In the same interview with Enaudeau, the philosopher recounted another disquieting episode from his childhood: 
{{Quote|text=Around the age of twelve, I searched through his [[bookshelf]] and found, mixed in with the trial documents, a volume of related photographs about the [[death camps]]. This book suddenly introduced me to an unsuspected universe that defied all thought. I remember the photos of deportees, whose gazes called out to me as if they were from another planet; I remember heaps, actual piles of [[glasses]] several meters high, poignant images of [[mass killings]]. These images have never left me.|author=Miguel Abensour|title=La Communauté des "tous uns"|source=p. 376 [translation]}}
[[File:Ma Oran Algérie.jpg|alt=Picture of the city of Oran located in Algeria|thumb|189x189px|[[Image|Picture]] of the city of [[Oran]] ([[Algeria]]), taken from Mount Aïdour (2013).]]
Abensour was also deeply marked by the period of the [[Algerian War]], "especially the idea that [[torture]] was commonly practiced, even by people who had been part of the [French] [[French Resistance|resistance]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Combis |first=Hélène |date=April 23, 2017 |title=Miguel Abensour, penseur à contre-pente de la philosophie politique |url=https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/miguel-abensour-penseur-a-contre-pente-de-la-philosophie-politique-6235356 |access-date=August 8, 2023 |website=France Culture}}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>" In 1957, he spent part of the summer in [[Oran]]: "An atmosphere of widespread hatred prevailed there. All communities despised each other. I could also observe the humiliations that [[Algerians]] endured daily from the [[French Algeria|French colonizers]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |title=La Communauté politique des "tous uns."

=== Academic career ===
Holding an [[agrégation]] in political science, Abensour began his teaching career as a professor of this discipline at [[University of Burgundy|Dijon]] during the 1960s.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":8">{{Cite journal |last=Delmotte |first=Fabien |date=May 5, 2015 |title=Miguel Abensour: repenser l'utopie |url=https://laviedesidees.fr/Miguel-Abensour-repenser-l-utopie.html |access-date=August 8, 2023 |journal=La vie des idées}}</ref> Later, he spent some time at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]]. In 1973, he obtained a PhD in [[political science]] after successfully defending in 1973 a ''[[Doctorate|thèse d'État]]'' on [[utopia]] in the 19th century, first supervised by [[Charles Eisenmann (jurist)|Charles Eisenmann]] and later by [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |title=Critique de la politique: Autour de Miguel Abensour |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2006 |isbn=978-2-84534-130-2 |editor-last=Kupiec |editor-first=Anne |location=Paris |pages=617 |editor-last2=Tassin |editor-first2=Étienne}}</ref>

During the 1970s, when a doctorate program in [[Political philosophy|political theory]] was established, he was appointed as a professor of political science at the [[University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne|University of Reims]].<ref name=":2" /> He established there the Centre de philosophie politique,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vermeren |first=Patrice |date=May 28, 2017 |title=Amb motiu de la mort de Miguel Abensour |url=https://mirmanda.blogspot.com/2017/05/en-motiu-de-la-mort-de-miguel-abensour.html |access-date=August 8, 2023 |website=Mirmanda}}</ref> where [[Claude Lefort]] and [[Pierre Clastres]] came to present their works.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal |last=Perrier |first=Florent |date=2017 |title=Miguel Abensour, l'utopie pour fil rouge |url=https://www.en-attendant-nadeau.fr/2017/07/18/miguel-abensour/ |journal=En Attendant Nadeau |volume=37 |pages=68–72}}</ref> In 1990, he joined the [[Paris Diderot University|University of Paris VII-Denis Diderot]], where he taught until the end of his career and eventually became [[Emeritus|professor emeritus]] of political philosophy.<ref name=":2" /> Within this university, he took part in the adventure of the Centre de sociologie des pratiques et des représentations politiques and its affiliated journal, ''Tumultes''.<ref name=":1" />

As a professor, he supervised the doctoral theses of several influential figures in the renewal of political philosophy in France, including [[Luc Ferry]], Philippe Raynaud, Jean-Michel Besnier, and Étienne Tassin.<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal |last=Breaugh |first=Martin |date=2003 |title=Critique de la domination, pensée de l'émancipation.

=== Intellectual journey ===

==== From journal to journal ====
Miguel Abensour was "an active figure in the world of journals.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bordes |first=François |date=2018 |title=Prismes. Théorie critique |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-la-revue-des-revues-2018-2-page-113.htm#s1n4 |journal=La revue des revues |volume=60 |pages=113–19}}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>"  His first published article, appearing in two installments in the ''Annales historiques de la Révolution française'', was dedicated to [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |date=1966 |title=La philosophie politique de Saint-Just.

According to Franck Berthot, those two journals played a significant role in the resurgence of [[political philosophy]] in France during the turning point of the 1980s with critical discussion of the themes of democracy and [[totalitarianism]], emancipation and domination.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last=Berthot |first=Franck |title=Les revues et la dynamique des ruptures |publisher=Presses Universitaires de Rennes |year=2007 |isbn=978-2753504288 |editor-last=Hourmant |editor-first=François |location=Rennes |pages=105–29 |chapter=_Textures_ et _Libre_ (1971-1980) : Une tentative de renouvellement de la philosophie politique en France |editor-last2=Baudouin |editor-first2=Jean}}</ref>

His involvement within these journals was intense,<ref name=":10">{{Cite web |last1=Cervera-Marzal |first1=Manuel |last2=Poirier |first2=Nicholas |date=2017 |title=Nécrologie – Désir d'utopies.

I participated in ''Textures'', ''Libre'', ''Passé-Présent'', ''Tumultes''; the practice of writing has the merit of introducing distance between the members of the journal.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Poizat |first1=Jean-Claude |last2=Abensour |first2=Miguel |date=2015 |title=Entretien avec Miguel Abensour |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-le-philosophoire-2015-2-page-11.htm |journal=Le Philosophoire |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=11–37|doi=10.3917/phoir.044.0011 |doi-access=free }}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>"

In the early 1970s Abensour became involved with the journal ''Textures'', created and led by the Belgian [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] Marc Richir.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last=Dosse |first=François |title=Castoriadis: Une vie |publisher=La Découverte |year=2014 |isbn=978-2-7071-7126-9 |location=Paris |pages=}}</ref> In 1977, along with [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Pierre Clastres]], [[Marcel Gauchet]], [[Claude Lefort]], and Maurice Luciani, he co-founded the journal ''Libre'' under the Payot editions.<ref name=":4" />

From 1982 to 1984, he collaborated with the journal ''Passé-Présent'',<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 14, 2019 |title=Passé Présent (1982–1984) |url=http://www.revues-litteraires.com/articles.php?lng=fr&pg=3689 |access-date=August 8, 2023 |website=Revues littéraires}}</ref> created and led by Claude Lefort.<ref name=":4" /> In the mid-1990s, he contributed to the journal ''Tumultes'', published by the Centre de sociologie des pratiques et des représentations politiques at Paris VII, under the direction of Sonia Dayan-Herzbrun.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cingolani |first=Patick |date=2011 |title=Naissance de Tumultes |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-tumultes-2011-2-page-19.htm |journal=Tumultes |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=19–22|doi=10.3917/tumu.037.0019 }}</ref> He also participated, as part of the editorial board, in the journal ''Épokhé'', created and led by Marc Richir.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Épokhé |url=https://www.millon.fr/collections/12-epokhe.html |access-date=August 8, 2023 |website=Éditions Jérôme Millon}}</ref>

Finally, in 2017, just before his passing, he co-founded the journal ''Prismes'' with Michèle Cohen-Halimi, Anne Kupiec, [[Géraldine Muhlmann]], Katia Genel, and Gilles Moutot. The inaugural volume of Prismes was published in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018 |title=Prismes: Théorie critique |url=https://sens-tonka.net/prismes-theorie-critique |access-date=August 8, 2023 |website=Sens & Tonka & Cie}}</ref>

==== The Collège international de philosophie ====
In the 1980s, Abensour was involved with the [[Collège international de philosophie]]. He [[Chairperson|chaired]] its collegial assembly from November 1985 to December 1987, succeeding [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]].<ref name=":18">{{Cite book |last=Cervera-Marzal |first=Manuel |title=Miguel Abensour : Critique de la domination, pensée de l'émancipation |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2013 |isbn=978-2-84534-216-3 |location=Paris |pages=15}}</ref> According to [[Élisabeth de Fontenay]], "[Abensour] displayed genuine inventiveness in democratically and effectively directing an institution that was still in the fragility and instability of its nascent state.<ref name=":6">{{Cite book |last=Fontenay |first=Élizabeth de |title=Critique de la politique : Autour de Miguel Abensour |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2006 |isbn=978-2845341302 |editor-last=Kupiec |editor-first=Anne |location=Paris |pages=25–6 |chapter=La présidence d'une utopie}}</ref>" She points out that he was the one who "established the principle of [[voting]], and it was under the guidance of the executive committee he chaired that the program directors were installed, and thus the new institution of the collegial assembly.<ref name=":6" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" She also notes that he initiated the "Bibliothèque du Collège international de philosophie" collection with Aubier editions and was the driving force behind the creation of the ''Cahiers'' of the Collège international de philosophie,<ref name=":6" /> a journal that collected contributions both from within and outside the university, following a model similar to that of the [[Frankfurt School]].<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal |last1=Abensour |first1=Miguel |last2=Derrida |first2=Jacques |last3=Dobbles |first3=Daniel |last4=Fontenay |first4=Élizabeth de |last5=Mallet |first5=Marie-Louise |last6=Tassin |first6=Étienne |date=1998 |title=Conversation autour du Collège international de philosophie |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-lignes0-1998-3-page-121.htm?contenu=resume |journal=Lignes |volume=35 |issue=35 |pages=121–36|doi=10.3917/lignes0.035.0121 |s2cid=144428968 }}</ref>

Furthermore, his presidency is remembered for the "[[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]. Questions ouvertes" [[Congress|colloquium]] held in March 1987, where [[Emmanuel Levinas]] agreed to express his profound ambivalence toward the German philosopher and his implication in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]].<ref name=":5" /> In a conversation about the history of the Collège international de philosophie, Derrida revisits this colloquium organized by Éliane Escoubas and Abensour:<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" /> "The example of the Heidegger colloquium—we could cite many others if we had the time—was particularly remarkable in this respect because it took place during the height of the '[[Martin Heidegger and Nazism|Heidegger affair]].' I remember interventions where, on one hand, there was evidence of competence in interpreting Heidegger's texts, and on the other hand, various ways of disagreeing with Heidegger were demonstrated, posing questions, especially political ones, to his texts and thoughts without succumbing to media trials and hasty methods that dominated the public scene.<ref name=":7" /><sup>[fr]</sup>"

==== Conflicts and intellectual friendships ====
Abensour experienced rifts with two founders of the journal ''Libre'': [[Claude Lefort]] and [[Marcel Gauchet]]. With Lefort, the disagreement arose in the 1990s when Lefort proposed a critique of the [[French Revolution]] through the lens of [[totalitarianism]] and thus aligned with historian [[François Furet]]'s interpretation, tendentious in Abensour's eyes.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Vermeren |first=Patrice |title=Désir d'utopie : Politique et émancipation avec Miguel Abensour |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2018 |isbn=978-2-343-14225-8 |editor-last=Cervera-Marzal |editor-first=Manuel |edition=Poirier |location=Nicholas |chapter=Saint-Just contre Saint-Just ? Miguel Abensour, la Révolution comme énigme et le paradoxe de son héros}}</ref>

In the case of Gauchet, the break officially occurred when Gauchet, former friend and colleague, accused Abensour of being a leader of "revoltism".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gauchet |first=Marcel |title=La Condition historique |publisher=Stock |year=2003 |isbn=9782070775767 |location=Paris |pages=203–205 |language=French}}</ref> Gauchet used this term to describe the paradoxical stance of a certain [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-totalitarian]] far-left that struggled to reconcile its love for democracy with an [[Ultra-leftism|ultracritical]] posture. According to Gauchet, the aesthetics of intransigence and the cult of rupture don't coexist easily with the idea of collective self-governance. In his response, Abensour dismissed Gauchet's criticisms and embraced the label of "revoltist".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |title=Lettre d'un révoltiste à Marcel Gauchet converti à la politique normale |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2008 |isbn=9782845341821 |location=Paris |language=French}}</ref> While Gauchet, following the decline of the [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary horizon]] and the establishment of a certain liberal reality, saw democracy and revolution as opposed, Abensour argued that this opposition is null since, following the insight of the [[Young Marx|young Karl Marx]] in his critique of [[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Hegelian political right]], the essence of democracy can only be understood as a continuous effort of resistance and even destruction of the [[State (polity)|State]]-form, making democracy the revolutionary regime per excellence.

Abensour shared a path with [[Maximilien Rubel]], publishing Rubel's ''Marx, critique du marxisme'' in his "Critique de la politique" collection.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rubel |first=Maximilien |title=Marx, critique du marxisme |publisher=Payot |year=1974 |isbn=978-2228892964 |location=Paris}}</ref> Upon the publication of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s complete works in the [[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade|Pléiade]], Abensour wrote an article titled "Pour lire Marx," defending Rubel's editorial work.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |date=1970 |title=Pour lire Marx |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/rfsp_0035-2950_1970_num_20_4_393250 |journal=Revue française de science politique |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=772–88|doi=10.3406/rfsp.1970.393250 }}</ref> He also shared with Rubel "the thesis of a Marx engaged in a unitary critique of bourgeois society, oriented toward a project of radical emancipation.<ref name=":8" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" When launching a new "Critique de la politique" collection at Klincksieck editions, Abensour republished one of Rubel's books: ''Karl Marx, essai de biographie intellectuelle''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rubel |first=Maximilien |title=Karl Marx, essai de biographie intellectuelle |publisher=Klincksieck |year=2016 |location=Paris}}</ref>

Abensour also formed a deep friendship and a true intellectual companionship with Louis Janover,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Janover |first=Louis |date=May 3, 2017 |title=Pour Miguel. Le sens éthique de son œuvre |url=https://editionslibertalia.com/blog/pour-miguel-abensour |access-date=August 9, 2023 |website=Libertalia}}</ref> who was, among other things, a collaborator with Rubel on the edition of Marx's complete works in the Pléiade. In memory of Rubel, Abensour and Janover published ''Maximilien Rubel.

Abensour died on 22 April 2017, at the age of 78, in Paris. His body rests at the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery|Père-Lachaise Cemetery]].<ref name=":5" />

== Life as an editor ==

=== Transmitting works ===
Abensour has been a tireless conveyor of texts.<ref name=":9" /> According to Lucia Sagradini, "Miguel Abensour's entire intellectual life has been intertwined with embodying a philosophical thought that has intersected with reading, writing books, as well as the work of transmission, involving authors of [[Critical theory]], whose reception he facilitated in French, and also through his work as a professor throughout the years.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sagradini |first=Lucia |date=2017 |title=Pour Miguel Abensour |url=https://journals.openedition.org/variations/875 |journal=Variations |issue=20|doi=10.4000/variations.875 |doi-access=free }}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>"

As such, Abensour ensured the transmission of a considerable number of texts: over a hundred titles in his "Critique de la politique" collection at Payot.<ref name=":10" /> Among many of his feats, he published the complete works of [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]],<ref>{{Cite book |last=Saint-Just |first=Louis Antoine de |title=Œuvres complètes |publisher=Gallimard |year=2004 |isbn=978-2-07-042275-3 |editor-last=Abensour |editor-first=Miguel |location=Paris}}</ref> he edited a Cahier de [[L'Herne]] dedicated to [[Emmanuel Levinas]] containing numerous unpublished materials,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cahier de l'Herne : Emmanuel Levinas |publisher=Librairie générale française |year=1993 |isbn=2851970690 |editor-last=Abensour |editor-first=Miguel |location=Paris |editor-last2=Chalier |editor-first2=Catherine}}</ref> he organized a [[Congress|colloquium]] focused on the work of [[Hannah Arendt]] at the [[Collège international de philosophie]],<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Collège international de philosophie |title=Politique et pensée : Colloque Hannah Arendt |last2=Goethe-Institut de Paris |publisher=Payot & Rivages |year=2004 |isbn=978-2-228-89893-5 |location=Paris}}</ref> he is the one who initiated the French translation of [[E.

=== Heading a collection ===
Abensour was the founder of the "Critique de la politique" [[Collection (publishing)|collection]]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Horkheimer |first=Max |title=Éclipse de la raison |collaboration= |publisher=Payot |year=1974 |location=Paris |chapter='Critique de la politique' by Miguel Abensour}}</ref> at Payot publishers (from 1974 to 2015).<ref>{{Cite book |last=BnF, Notice de collection éditoriale (Payot) |title=Critique de la politique |url=https://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb342348331 |access-date=August 9, 2023 |via=BnF Catalogue général|date=1974 |publisher=Payot }}</ref> After an editorial dispute, he continued the collection at Klincksieck publishers from 2016 until his passing in 2017, still under the name "Critique de la politique." The collection is now directed by Michèle Cohen-Halimi.<ref>{{Cite web |last=BnF, Notice de collection éditoriale (Kilncksieck) |title=Critique de la politique |url=https://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb451569698 |access-date=August 9, 2023 |website=BnF Catalogue général}}</ref>

With the expression of "critique de la politique" (or "critique of politics" in English), Abensour, according to Nicolas Poirier, aimed to "designate a constellation of thinkers driven by a shared desire for freedom, as well as practices and events that demonstrate that humans can find within themselves the means to escape servitude.<ref name=":1" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" Antonia Birnbaum describes the creation of this collection as follows: "A young man, inspired by his readings, returns from the US and proposes to a publisher, Payot, to create an anti-textbook using [[Critical theory|critical]] texts from [[political philosophy]].

In addition to reissuing works by lesser-known authors ([[Giuseppe Bencivenni Pelli|Giuseppe Pelli Bencivenni]], [[Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville]], or [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis]]) and publishing the [[Thesis|theses]] of young [[Scholar|researchers]] (Étienne Tassin, [[Géraldine Muhlmann]], Blaise Bachofen, [[Martin Breaugh]], or Nicolas Poirier), Abensour contributed to the dissemination of the writings of the [[Frankfurt School]] founders in France by offering translations of their works,<ref name=":11" /> such as the first title in the collection with [[Max Horkheimer]]'s ''[[Eclipse of Reason (Horkheimer)|Eclipse of Reason]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Horkheimer |first=Max |title=L'Éclipse de la raison |publisher=Payot |year=1974 |location=Paris}}</ref> Later on, he had books translated from [[Theodor W.

According to Antonia Birnbaum, "It's the connection with emancipation that motivates Miguel Abensour's relationship with books.<ref name=":11" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" For Nicolas Poirier, "M. Abensour was a publisher for whom the act of publication was an act of thought in its own right.<ref name=":1" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" Indeed, his editorial activity<ref name=":9" /> was an integral part of his philosophical work, and the texts of the authors he published were at the core of his reflection, as seen in this excerpt: "To consider the return of political matters," writes Abensour, "an inquiry is necessary into the relationship between critical theory (Theodor W. Adorno, Max Horkheimer, [[Herbert Marcuse]]) and political philosophy. While critical theory tends toward [[Pessimism|catastrophism]], meaning an association between domination and politics, political philosophy, on the contrary, sometimes tends to erase the phenomenon of domination in favor of a political space conceived on the model of an exchange among equal participants. A critical political philosophy should take into account, following [[Étienne de La Boétie|La Boétie]], especially the fact that domination tends to arise within the political realm.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |date=2003 |title=Philosophie politique critique et émancipation ? |url=http://id.erudit.org/iderudit/008853ar |journal=Politique et sociétés |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=119–42|doi=10.7202/008853ar }}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>"

== Research and works ==
Disseminated throughout numerous articles, intertwined with reflections on utopias, and driven by an "insurgent" conception of democracy, Abensour's thought constitutes a "critical-utopian political philosophy"<ref name=":13" /> aimed at emancipation. Below, among the many inquiries pursued by Abensour, his critique of political philosophy, his approach to revolution, his unveiling of an alternative utopia, his concern regarding totalitarianism, and his conception of democracy are discussed

=== Critique of political philosophy ===
Abensour was interested in identifying the essence of politics and its conditions of possibility. He examined the moments when individuals come together to take action or associate for a specific purpose, e.g., a [[Rebellion|revolt]], a revolution, a [[Strike action|strike]], the creation of [[Workers' council|councils]], etc. Delving into the diversity of political phenomena, he explored their limits, whether in the form of domination, [[apoliticism]], or [[totalitarianism]].<ref name=":14">{{Cite book |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |title=Pour une philosophie politique critique |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2009 |location=Paris}}</ref><ref name=":23">{{Cite book |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |title=De la compacité |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2009 |isbn=978-2845341067 |location=Paris}}</ref> Furthermore, he reflected on many kinds of political institutions that embody aspects of political activity such as workers' councils, [[leadership]], [[National Assembly|assembly]], democracy, or the [[State (polity)|State]].<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":14" /> He was concerned with determining whether a particular political activity or institution is truly political and what contribution can it make to emancipation. For instance, can totalitarianism, which denies its population any uniqueness, initiative, and ultimately, plurality, be regarded as a political regime?

Furthermore, Abensour questioned the relationship between philosophical activity and political engagement. Abensour believed that [[political philosophy]], both as a lineage of thought and as an [[academic discipline]], tended to subordinate the politics to principles distinct from its own. Drawing inspiration from Hannah Arendt's insights,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |title=Hannah Arendt contre la philosophie politique ? |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2006 |location=Paris}}</ref> Abensour asserted that the shift in political philosophy took place during [[Plato]]'s era, and since then, as an academic discipline, it consistently imposed its own categories and objectives onto "political things" (''les choses politiques'' in English). In other words, Abensour's argument is that political philosophy has inadvertently perpetuated systems of domination while inhibiting the pursuit of genuine emancipation.

=== The French Revolution: a guiding light ===
Abensour was drawn early to the study of revolutionary events: "I began my doctorate around 1965," Abensour stated. "Originally, I planned to study [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]]. But I realized it was unfeasible and abandoned the idea.<ref name=":15" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" Despite abandoning this particular focus, the writings and actions of [[French Revolution]]aries, as well as the interpretation of their endeavors, continued to intrigue him. Indeed, questions about the French Revolution and, on a broader scale, revolutions, resurfaced regularly within Abensour's work. This was evident in his [[Collection (publishing)|editorial collection]] "Critique de la politique," interviews, and texts. Above all, for Abensour, the notion of revolution "more than any other event, takes part in the core of history.<ref name=":16">{{Cite book |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |title=Le cœur de Brutus |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2019 |location=Paris}}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>"
[[File:Jacques Bertaux - Prise du palais des Tuileries - 1793.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Duplessis-Bertaux]]'s painting, ''[[Insurrection of 10 August 1792|Storming of the Tuileries on 10. Aug. 1792]] during the French Revolution'' (1793).]]
In the constellation of thinkers discussed by Abensour, [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] occupies a pivotal place. Abensour presented the French revolutionary as a perfect illustration of what he saw as the enigma of the French Revolution: "When we talk about Saint-Just, the enigma is all the more daunting because it's the enigma of the Revolution itself, and perhaps of all revolutions.<ref name=":17">{{Cite book |last=Saint-Just |first=Louis Antoine de |title=Œuvres complètes |publisher=Gallimard |year=2004 |location=Paris |chapter='Lire Saint-Just' by Miguel Abensour}}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>" Saint-Just's writings, speeches, and sometimes ambiguous actions encapsulated specific moments, ideas, and events of the French Revolution. On one hand, there's the desire to abolish the [[Ancien Régime]], while on the other, a certain conservative persistence. Thus, when Abensour explores the French Revolution through the lens of Saint-Just: "It's more about questioning the strange transformation of the Revolution into supreme authority, pondering how the Revolution metamorphoses into a new absolute.<ref name=":16" /><sup>[fr]</sup>"

Abensour also approached the Revolution from the perspective of [[hero]]ism.<ref name=":16" /> According to him, heroism went hand in hand with the Revolution, and can perhaps be said to be a feature of every revolution: "As for me, I considered heroism a primary datum, a ''constitutive dimension'' of the Revolution. I claim the centrality of heroism, which can be seen as the essential element of the Revolution in the strong sense of the term, meaning it is an environment in which the actors are immersed"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |title=La lumière et la boue : Le Rouge et le Noir à l'ombre de 1793 |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2019 |location=Paris}}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>.

However, Abensour took care to distinguish the [[Modernity|modern]] hero from the [[Ancient history|ancient]] hero; furthermore, he established a [[Typology (social science research method)|typology]] of modern heroism: "anti-heroic heroism," "heroism of sincerity," "heroism of mastering appearances".<ref name=":16" /> For Abensour, the modern revolutionary hero has tended to substitute an [[Ethics|ethical]] aim for their political purpose. Consequently, the Revolution would no longer be political but ethical and, as a result, it would lose its primary goal, i.e., changing the organization of the political community. Even more concerning, according to Abensour, many revolutionary heroes wanted to use the Revolution to actually put an end to politics, considered as essentially conflictual and violent. This last aspect of heroism is especially disastrous as it aims nothing less than to deny the existence of political things and, consequently, create a space where domination can occur.

Nonetheless, Abensour still linked heroism to [[freedom]]: "The experience of the Revolution, as an experience of freedom, involved extreme peril; anyone who didn't know this knew nothing of it.<ref name=":17" /><sup>[fr]</sup>"

=== Revifying{{clarify|date=October 2023|reason=reifying?}} utopias ===
Abensour devoted his ''[[Doctorate|thèse d'État]]'' to [[utopia]] in the 19th century: "Les formes de l'utopie socialiste-communiste. Essai sur le communisme critique et l'utopie (1973, two volumes never published<ref name=":18" />). In it, according to [[Mona Ozouf]], "Miguel Abensour undertakes, against a certain [[Marxism]] but with the assistance of a certain [[Karl Marx|Marx]], the rehabilitation of utopia.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ozouf |first=Mona |date=1980 |title=L'utopie, encore et toujours |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-le-debat-1980-2-page-126.htm?contenu=resume |journal=Le Débat |volume=2|issue=2 |page=126 |doi=10.3917/deba.002.0126 }}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>" Starting with [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialists]] and a re-reading of Karl Marx, he considered utopia to be multifaceted and distinguished different periods of utopia in the 19th century:

* "utopian socialism," with leading figures such as [[Henri de Saint-Simon|Claude-Henri de Rouvroy de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Robert Owen]];
* "neo-utopianism," represented by [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] disciples, for example, [[Victor Prosper Considerant|Victor Considerant]] in the case of Fourier;
* the "new utopian spirit" of [[Pierre Leroux]], [[William Morris]], [[Edward Bellamy]], [[Joseph Déjacque]], or [[Ernest Cœurderoy]].

This last period, this "new utopian spirit," continued into the 20th century, and took on a new form: "the particularity of the new utopian spirit is to produce not utopias but a discourse on utopia, a renewed thinking of utopia. The prominent names are [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Martin Buber]], [[critical theory]] ([[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]], [[Walter Benjamin]]), and also [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [...]. One must also consider certain directions of [[surrealism]], especially in [[André Breton]]'s relationship with Fourier, and certain directions of the [[avant-garde]], such as [[Situationist International|situationism]] or the ''Utopie'' magazine in France.<ref name=":19">{{Cite journal |last1=Dayan-Hezbrun |first1=Sonia |last2=Kupiec |first2=Anne |last3=Murar |first3=Numa |date=2006 |title=L'homme est un animal utopique : Entretien avec Miguel Abensour |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-mouvements-2006-3-page-71.htm |journal=Mouvements |volume=45-46 |issue=45–46 |pages=71–86|doi=10.3917/mouv.045.86 }}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>"

More generally, Abensour believed that "just as it's mistaken to reduce utopia to a [[literary genre]] at the risk of disconnecting it from the sociopolitical and only considering it from the perspective of [[History of literature|literary history]], it's equally absurd to read utopia as if it were a portrayal of a historical society or a travelogue of a particular existing [[Polity|political community]].<ref name=":20">{{Cite book |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |title=Le procès des Maîtres Rêveurs: Utopiques I |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2013 |location=Paris}}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>" Against these reductions and interpretations of utopia, Abensour put forth a "plurality of perspectives" in his [[Collection (publishing)|editorial collection]] "Critique de la politique." Among some of them, Abensour asserted that [[Thomas More]] "truly invented, with ''[[Utopia (More book)|Utopia]]'', a new [[rhetorical device]] and thus attempted an unprecedented intervention in the political field<ref name=":21">{{Cite book |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |title=Utopia from Thomas More to Walter Benjamin |publisher=Univocal |year=2017 |location=Minneapolis}}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>"; he viewed Pierre Leroux as "a utopian activist with a long utopian practice<ref name=":20" /><sup>[fr]</sup>"; he believed that Karl Marx accomplished a "rescue by transference" of utopia;<ref>{{Cite book |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |title=L'histoire de l'utopie et le destin de sa critique : Utopiques IV |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2013 |location=Paris}}</ref> he considered that Walter Benjamin was "chasing down the mythology or delirium" that inhabits or ruins the utopias of the 19th century;<ref name=":21" /> or he detected in Emmanuel Levinas another way of thinking utopia, a "Thought of utopia under the sign of the Encounter.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |title=Levinas |publisher=Sens & Tonka |year=2021 |location=Paris}}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>"

On a deeper level, Abensour envisioned humans as "utopian animals": "[This expression] is an attempt to situate the human, the intricacies of the human, perhaps unsituable, unlocatable, evading assignment to a specific place and thereby gesturing towards a non-place. It's also in this sense that the human is utopian or that Levinas could speak of a utopia of the human.<ref name=":22">{{Cite book |last=Abensour |first=Miguel |title=Emmanuel Levinas, l'intrigue de l'humain. Entre métapolitique et politique : Entretiens avec Danielle Cohen-Levinas |publisher=Hermann |year=2012 |location=Paris}}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>" And he added: "Shouldn't we go further? Isn't it because the human is anarchic that it forges connections with the non-place of utopia?<ref name=":22" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" Finally, Abensour saw in utopia "an obstinate impetus towards [[freedom]] and [[justice]], which, despite all failures, all denials, all defeats, is reborn in history, resurfaces, which, even in the darkest of catastrophes, makes itself heard, resists, as if the catastrophe itself gives rise to a new utopian summoning.<ref name=":19" /><sup>[fr]</sup>"

=== Totalitarianism: an existential threat for politics ===
Abensour was deeply concerned by the emergence of [[totalitarianism]], by these attempts to put an end to the political, especially the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet regime]].
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146III-373, Modell der Neugestaltung Berlins ("Germania").jpg|thumb|[[Albert Speer]]'s [[Urban planning|plan]] for building a new capital, "[[Germania (city)|Germania]]," for [[Nazi Germany]] at the demand of [[Adolf Hitler]]. ]]
Abensour believed that totalitarianism is a complete novelty in socio-historical terms and a pivotal fact of the 20th century: "A double novelty, one might say: totalitarianism is the new element of our century, and as such, it is its 'core' ([[Hannah Arendt]]); in the history of domination, it represents a radically new [[Regime|form]] in that it aims to do nothing less than erase the political condition of human beings.<ref name=":14" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" Thus, for Abensour, totalitarianism is a form of "unprecedented, incomparable domination, and due to its incommensurable nature, it is irreducible to other forms of domination that have appeared in history, whether [[despotism]], [[Tyrant|tyranny]], or [[fascism]], as there are fascisms that are not necessarily totalitarian.<ref name=":14" /><sup>[fr]</sup>"

Furthermore, according to Abensour, another characteristic of totalitarianism is the way it generates [[apoliticism]]. Totalitarianism shouldn't be understood as an "excess of politics," but rather as the "destruction of politics" as it directly attacks the very conditions of possibility of politics.

Abensour's examination of [[Albert Speer]], a Nazi architect, perfectly illustrates the irreparable wound caused by totalitarianism to politics.<ref name=":23" />  Abensour contends that all architecture (whether it is a house, a building, a private or institutional structure, a [[Town square|square]], or even [[urban planning]], etc.) varies according to political regimes and ways of instituting politics. In the case of totalitarianism: "Architecture, as a constitutive element of a totalitarian regime—where its ''[[First principle|arché]]'', its command, unfolds—establishes a space that is neither public nor political .<ref name=":23" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" The monuments designed and created by Albert Speer embodied this negation of politics. Moreover, they aimed to unite the [[Germans|German people]] indivisibly: "Nazi monumentality, both the gigantism of the [[Mass society|masses]] (the 'human walls') and the gigantism of the buildings, instead of creating the 'public,' produces the massive and the 'compact,' seeking absolute cohesion.<ref name=":23" /><sup>[fr]</sup>"

== Posterity ==

=== France ===
Firstly, Abensour bequeathed to posterity his "Critique de la politique," an [[Collection (publishing)|editorial collection]] with an "astonishing catalog".<ref name=":0" /> In his [[obituary]], Robert Maggiori wrote: "This collection is, one might say, his 'opus.'<ref>{{Cite news |last=Maggiori |first=Robert |date=April 24, 2017 |title=Miguel Abensour, fin de l'utopie |pages=26 |work=[[Libération]] |url=https://www.liberation.fr/culture/2017/04/23/miguel-abensour-fin-de-l-utopie_1564697/ |access-date=August 11, 2023}}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>" This judgment aligns with that of [[Jean Birnbaum]], who, in a 2006 article dedicated to Abensour's collection, wrote: "Rarely, indeed, have [[Intellectual|intellectual vocation]] and [[Publishing|editorial]] adventure converged so remarkably in a single path of ideas.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Birnbaum |first=Jean |date=August 10, 2023 |title="Critique de la politique" : chez les maîtres rêveurs |pages=15 |work=[[Le Monde]] |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2006/08/10/critique-de-la-politique-chez-les-maitres-reveurs_802436_3260.html |access-date=August 11, 2023}}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>" On his part, Florent Perrier emphasized that this collection has been "one of the most important in the [[Geographical distribution of French speakers|Francophone]] world in the broader field of [[political philosophy]].<ref name=":5" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" Others, like Emmanuel Renault and Yves Sintomer, writing the "Introduction" of a work dedicated to Critical Theory,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Où en est la théorie critique ? |publisher=La Découverte |year=2003 |editor-last=Renault |editor-first=Emmanuel |location=Paris |editor-last2=Sintomer |editor-first2=Yves}}</ref> or like Jean-François Kervégan, questioned about the lasting impact of [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]]' introduction in [[French philosophy]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Fœssel |first1=Michael |last2=Haber |first2=Stéphane |last3=Kervégan |first3=Jean-François |date=2015 |title=L'effet Habermas dans la philosophie française |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-esprit-2015-8-page-55.htm |journal=[[Esprit (magazine)|Esprit]] |volume=8–9 |pages=55–68}}</ref> recognized the importance of this collection for the French reception of the writings of theorists from the [[Frankfurt School]]. Louis Pinto, acknowledging Abensour's role as a mediator in the reception of [[Critical theory]], argued that Abensour "contributed to inventing a new intellectual style in the philosophical field, a kind of '[[avant-garde]] [[Academy|academism]]' that claimed pretensions of radical rupture distinct from those of the philosophical avant-garde of the previous generation, sometimes referred to as '[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]'.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pinto |first=Louis |date=2020 |title=Le commerce des idées philosophiques : Le cas des médiateurs français de la "théorie critique" de Francfort |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-europeenne-des-sciences-sociales-2020-1-page-117.htm |journal=Revue européenne des sciences sociales |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=117–47|doi=10.4000/ress.6446 |s2cid=182530110 }}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>"

Furthermore, among Abensour's works and research, two poles have particularly attracted commentary and commentators: the [[utopia]]n pole and the democratic pole. Regarding the first pole, [[Louis Janover]] recalled the context of Abensour's research and work: "It is up to him, indeed, not only to have unearthed forgotten authors at a time when utopia had been banished to that undefined space known as pre-[[Marxism]] but also to have reintroduced them into the genealogy of the [[Labour movement|labor movement]].<ref name=":25" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" In the same issue of the journal ''Lignes'', Michèle Cohen-Halimi and [[Sophie Wahnich]] wrote: "Miguel Abensour has thus heroically become one of the greatest thinkers of utopia, one of the greatest conveyors of utopias of all times, from [[Thomas More]] to [[Walter Benjamin]].<ref name=":25" /><sup>[fr]</sup>"

The democratic pole of Abensour's research and work has gathered much attention, as his idea of "insurgent democracy" aligns with certain theoretical conceptions democracy (notably those of [[Claude Lefort]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Ernesto Laclau]], and [[Chantal Mouffe]]) now collectively referred to as "[[radical democracy]]".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Démocratie et modernité : La pensée politique française contemporaine |publisher=Presses Universitaires de Rennes |year=2015 |editor-last=Chevrier |editor-first=Marc |location=Rennes |editor-last2=Couture |editor-first2=Yves |editor-last3=Vibert |editor-first3=Stéphane}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |date=2019 |editor-last=Deleixhe |editor-first=Martin |editor2-last=Delmotte |editor2-first=Florence |title=Démocratie radicale : retours critiques |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-raisons-politiques-2019-3.htm |journal=Raisons Politiques |issue=75}}</ref><ref name=":10" /> According to Monique Rouillé-Boireau, "in Miguel Abensour's savage or 'insurgent' democracy, the aim is to maintain the idea of pluralities within the [[Polity|political community]], and this takes place within an [[Agonism|agonistic]] framework of struggle against the [[State (polity)|State]], of resistance to the State.<ref name=":24" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" In the same spirit, Max Blechman wrote, "In true democracy, the abstract political State is dissolved as it is reduced to the essentials: a constitutional objectification, nothing more, and it is important to emphasize, nothing less than the political moment of the overall self-determination of the entire ''[[People|demos]].''<ref name=":2" /><sup>[fr]</sup>" However, Abensour's "insurgent democracy" is not without its critiques. For instance, Martin Deleixhe has argued that conceiving democracy against the State, that is, opposing the entirety of the people to the institutional form of the State, implies envisioning the people as a kind of totality "whose unity is both the goal and the principle of true democracy.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Deleixhe |first=Martin |date=2019 |title=La démocratie radicale et critique du marxisme. Démocratie, État et conflictualité |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-raisons-politiques-2019-3-page-29.htm |journal=Raison Politiques |volume=75 |issue=75|pages=29–44 |doi=10.3917/rai.075.0029 |s2cid=210371835 }}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>" Similarly Audric Vitiello remarked, "One can question the concrete outcome of such a conception hostile to all [[Institutionalisation|institutionalization]]: if every institution leads to the ''[[First principle|arkhè]]'', [...], if democracy always emerges 'against the State,' it seems difficult, if not impossible, to establish a genuinely democratic regime.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vitello |first=Audric |date=2008 |title=Démocratie radicale |url=http://www.dicopo.org/spip_article104.html |access-date=August 11, 2023 |website=DicoPo : Dictionnaire de théorie politique}}</ref><sup>[fr]</sup>"
