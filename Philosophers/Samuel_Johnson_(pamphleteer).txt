'''Samuel Johnson''' (1649–1703) was an English clergyman and political writer, sometimes called "the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] Johnson" to distinguish him from the [[Samuel Johnson|author and lexicographer]] of the same name, who was a [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] in politics and lived after him. He is one of the best known pamphlet writers who developed [[Whig resistance theory]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Phillipson|author2=Quentin Skinner|title=Political Discourse in Early Modern Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmLLrQ1CMC8C&pg=PA233|accessdate=4 April 2013|date=26 February 1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39242-6|page=233}}</ref>

==Life==
[[File:Greenhill, John - James II as Duke of York - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''James II as Duke of York'' (early 1660s) by [[John Greenhill]]. Johnson was a critic of the Duke of York, who later ascended the throne as [[James II of England]].]]

From a humble background, Samuel Johnson was educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St. Paul's School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and took orders.<ref>{{acad|id=JHN666S|name=Johnson, Samuel}}</ref> He attacked [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]] in ''Julian the Apostate'' (1682).

Johnson was illegally deprived of his orders, flogged, and imprisoned. He continued, however, his attacks on the Government by pamphlets, and did much to influence the public mind in favour of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. Dryden gave him a place in ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'' as "Benjochanan". After the Revolution he was restored to his orders and received a pension, but considered himself insufficiently rewarded by a [[deanery]], which he declined. He was married for many years and suffered from many illnesses.

==The ''Julian'' tracts==
Johnson's 1682 pamphlet ''Julian the Apostate'' was a reply to a sermon ''A Discourse of the Sovereign Power'' earlier the same year by [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]];<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=13203|title=Hickes, George|author=Theodor Harmsen}}</ref> it was printed by [[John Darby (printer)|John Darby]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=67087|title=Darby, John|author=Beth Lynch}}</ref> With its sequels, it employed a technique of vilification by the use of parallels in classical literature.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hugh Thomas Swedenberg|title=England in the Restoration and early eighteenth century: essays on culture and society|url=https://archive.org/details/englandinrestora00llif|url-access=registration|accessdate=4 April 2013|year=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01973-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/englandinrestora00llif/page/21 21]}}</ref> In 1683 he followed it with ''Julian's Arts'', but the timing turned out badly, with the revelations of the [[Rye House Plot]], and the pamphlet was held back.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Johnson, Samuel (1649-1703)|volume=30}}</ref>

''Julian the Apostate'' met with seven published replies, as well as becoming the target of Oxford sermons. These included pamphlets from Hickes (''Jovian''), John Bennet (''Constantius the Apostate''), [[Edward Meredith]], and [[Thomas Long (writer)|Thomas Long]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Melinda S.
