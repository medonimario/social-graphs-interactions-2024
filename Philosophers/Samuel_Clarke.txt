'''Samuel Clarke''' (11 October 1675 – 17 May 1729) was an English [[philosopher]] and [[Anglican cleric]]. He is considered the major British figure in philosophy between [[John Locke]] and [[George Berkeley]].<ref name="SEP">{{cite SEP |url-id=clarke |title=Samuel Clarke |last=Vailati |first=Ezio}}</ref> Clarke's [[Book of Common Prayer (Unitarian)|altered, Nontrinitarian revision]] of the [[Book of Common Prayer (1662)|1662 ''Book of Common Prayer'']] continues to influence worship among modern [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]].

==Early life and studies==
Clarke was born in [[Norwich]], the son of [[Edward Clarke (MP for Norwich)|Edward Clarke]], an alderman of [[Norwich, England|Norwich]] and Member of Parliament, and brother of [[John Clarke (dean of Salisbury)|John Clarke]].<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Clarke, John (1682-1757)}}</ref> He was educated at [[Norwich School]] and [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rY-8ceSYvWoC|title=A Concise Description of the Endowed Grammar Schools in England|first=Nicholas|last=Carlisle|year=1818|publisher=Baldwin, Craddock and Joy|page=187}}</ref><ref name="Venn">{{acad|id=CLRK690S|name=Clarke, Samuel}}</ref> His tutor at Caius was [[John Ellys (Caius)|John Ellis]], a personal friend of [[Isaac Newton]], but who in [[natural philosophy]] taught in line with the [[Cartesianism]] that prevailed in the university.<ref name="ODNB">{{cite ODNB|id=5530|title=Clarke, Samuel|first=John|last=Gascoigne}}</ref>

Clarke, however, came to adopt the new physical system of Newton; he used the vehicle of an annotated translation of a work on physics in the Cartesian tradition to comment on the superiority of the Newtonian system.<ref name="Pfiz">{{cite book|author=Thomas C.

Having taken [[holy orders]], Clarke became chaplain to Moore in Whiston's place, and was presented by Moore to the rectory of [[Drayton, Norfolk]].<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Clarke, Samuel (1675-1729)|volume=10}}</ref>

In 1706, through the influence of Moore, Clarke obtained the rectory of [[St Benet Paul's Wharf]], London. Soon afterwards [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] appointed him one of her [[Ecclesiastical Household|chaplains in ordinary]], and in 1709 presented him to the rectory of [[St James's Church, Piccadilly|St James's, Westminster]].<ref name="EB1911">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Clarke, Samuel|volume=6}}</ref> His church brought Clarke into personal contact with Newton.<ref name="Pfiz"/>

==Boyle Lectures (1704)==
Clarke was [[Boyle lecturer]] for two years, and produced two books. The Newtonian theologians used the Boyle Lectures to attack opponents ([[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[deists]] and [[freethinkers]] in particular). Clarke's lectures set the agenda for further debates.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Samuel Clarke|author2=Anthony Collins|title=The Correspondence of Samuel Clarke and Anthony Collins, 1707-08|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSd1oh73Sz0C&pg=PA14|access-date=29 May 2013|date=21 October 2011|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=978-1-77048-291-3|pages=14–5}}</ref> He dealt in 1704 with the ''Being and Attributes of God'', an example of a [[physico-theological system]];<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas C. Pfizenmaier|title=The Trinitarian Theology of Dr. Samuel Clarke (1675-1729): Context, Sources and Controversy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OemH4jKItGQC&pg=PA46|access-date=29 May 2013|year=1997|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10719-9|pages=46–7}}</ref> and in 1705 with the ''Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion''. These books were later published together.<ref>As ''A Discourse concerning the Being and Attributes of God, the Obligations of Natural Religion, and the Truth and Certainty of the Christian Revelation''; subtitled as in opposition to Hobbes, Spinoza, the author of the ''Oracles of Reason'' (i.e. [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]]), and other "Deniers of Natural and Revealed Religion".</ref>

Clarke's reputation rested largely on his effort to demonstrate the [[existence of God]], and his theory of the foundation of [[rectitude]]. The former is not a purely ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' argument, and it was not presented as such. The intelligence, for example, of the self-existence and original cause of all things is, he says, "not easily proved ''a priori''," but "demonstrably proved ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' from the variety and degrees of perfection in things, and the order of causes and effects, from the intelligence that created beings are confessedly endowed with, and from the beauty, order, and final purpose of things."<ref name="EB1911"/> The theses maintained in the argument are:<ref name="EB1911"/>

#That something has existed from eternity
#that there has existed from eternity some one immutable and independent being
#that that immutable and independent being, which has existed from eternity, without any external cause of its existence, must be self-existent, that is, necessarily existing
#what the substance or essence of that being is, which is self-existent or necessarily existing, we have no idea, neither is it at all possible for us to comprehend it
#that though the substance or essence of the self-existent being is itself absolutely incomprehensible to us, yet many of the essential attributes of his nature are strictly demonstrable as well as his existence, and, in the first place, that he must be of necessity eternal
#that the self-existent being must of necessity be infinite and omnipresent
#must be but one
#must be an intelligent being
#must be not a necessary agent, but a being endued with liberty and choice
#must of necessity have infinite power
#must be infinitely wise, and
#must of necessity be a being of infinite goodness, justice, and truth, and all other moral perfections, such as become the supreme governor and judge of the world.

In order to establish his sixth thesis, Clarke contended that time and space, eternity and immensity, are not substances, but attributes: the attributes of a self-existent being.<ref name="EB1911"/>
	 
The work of Clarke on the existence of God set off a British debate that lasted to the middle of the century.<ref name="Haakonssen2006">{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-century Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6ExSHrknywC&pg=PA715|access-date=8 September 2013|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86743-6|pages=715–6}}</ref> [[Edmund Law]] and other writers represented Clarke as arguing from the existence of time and space to the existence of Deity.<ref name="EB1911"/> Law was influenced by a 1718 work of [[Samuel Colliber]] that modified Clarke's approach.<ref name="Haakonssen2006"/>

==Correspondence with Anthony Collins==
The public correspondence of Samuel Clarke with the English freethinker [[Anthony Collins (philosopher)|Anthony Collins]] in 1707 and 1708 was a debate on the nature of [[consciousness]].  The principal focus of the correspondence was the possibility of a materialist theory of mind.  Collins defended the materialist position that consciousness was an [[emergent property]] of the brain, while Clarke opposed such a view and argued that mind and consciousness must be distinct from matter.  The correspondence also inquired into the origins of consciousness, personal identity, free will, and determinism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Samuel|last2=Collins|first2=Anthony|title=The Correspondence of Samuel Clarke and Anthony Collins, 1707-1708|editor=Uzgalis, William|year=2011|publisher=[[Broadview Press]]|location=Peterborough, Ontario|isbn=978-1-55111-984-7|page=9}}</ref>

The debate arose from a controversy of 1706 on the [[immortality of the soul]]. Clarke published a refutation of the views of [[Henry Dodwell]], and this drew in Collins, who wrote a ''Letter to Mr Dodwell'' in his defence.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Perry|title=Personal identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIE32PrcDzUC&pg=PA283|access-date=28 May 2013|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25642-2|page=283}}</ref> By the sixth edition (1731), Clarke's own ''Letter to Mr Dodwell'' of 1706 had grown to 475 pages, including the replies of Collins.<ref name="White2006">{{cite book|author=David E.

[[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] argued differently, though on Clarke's side of the debate, using in particular the ideas of [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mary Astell|author2=John Norris|title=Letters Concerning the Love of God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWKL2w4AW6wC&pg=PA33|access-date=28 May 2013|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0586-7|pages=33–4 note 75}}</ref> Collins challenged Clarke on the ground of his [[substance dualism]].<ref>Liam P.

==Nontrinitarianism==
===''The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity'' (1712)===
Clarke studied scripture in the original languages, and the [[Early Christianity|primitive Christian]] writers. He took the degree of [[D.D.|doctor in divinity]] in 1710,<ref name="Venn"/> defending as his thesis the two propositions: ''Nullum fidei Christianae dogma, in Sacris Scripturis traditum, est rectae rationi dissentaneum'' [No doctrine of the Christian faith, delivered in the Holy Scriptures, is contrary to right reason.], and ''Sine actionum humanarum libertate nulla potest esse religio'' [Without the freedom of human actions, there can be no religion.].<ref name="DNB"/> The formal [[disputation]] was long remembered for Clarke's virtuosity; but the presiding Regius Professor, [[Henry James (Regius Professor)|Henry James]], received the distinct impression that Clarke's views on the Trinity were unorthodox.<ref name="ODNB"/> Clarke was required to swear to keep the [[39 Articles]]; and his attempt at self-justification by putting his views in book form were not immediately successful.<ref name="Gascoigne2002">{{cite book|author=John Gascoigne|title=Cambridge in the Age of the Enlightenment: Science, Religion and Politics from the Restoration to the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QmwqzdMsRkC&pg=PA118|access-date=30 May 2013|date=18 July 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52497-1|page=118}}</ref>

During 1712 Clarke published his treatise on ''The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity''.<ref>''The Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity''; London: Printed for James Knapton, at the Crown in St. Paul's Church-Yard, 1712.</ref> It is divided into three parts. The first contains a collection and exegesis of texts in the [[New Testament]] relating to the [[doctrine of the Trinity]]; in the second the doctrine is set out, and explained as a set of propositions; and in the third passages in the [[liturgy]] of the [[Church of England]] relating to the doctrine of the Trinity are considered.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Whiston claimed that, some time before publication, a message was sent to Clarke by [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Sidney Godolphin]], to the effect "the affairs of the public were with difficulty then kept in the hands of those that were for liberty", and that therefore it was a bad time for the publication of a controversial book. Clarke in any case took no notice of any Whig qualms.<ref name="EB1911"/>

[[Maurice Wiles]] calls Clarke's views "moderate Arianism".<ref>{{cite book|author=Maurice Wiles|title=Archetypal Heresy: Arianism Through the Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKWjIQtq5gQC&pg=PA110|access-date=30 May 2013|date=26 September 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-826927-4|page=110}}</ref> At the time they were certainly denounced as [[Arianism]]; they belonged, as did Newton's, to the type of [[antitrinitarianism]] later called "High Arianism".<ref>{{cite book|author=David Nicholls|title=God and Government in an 'Age of Reason'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yAIkxVZJLUoC&pg=PT59|access-date=30 May 2013|date=11 January 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-98227-1|page=59}}</ref> Clarke's position was [[subordinationist]], and less radical than Newton's and typical English Unitarians of his time. He looked at 1251 biblical texts, and rejected the added phrase known as the [[Johannine Comma]]. He made a more careful case than Whiston.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ariel Hessayon|author2=Nicholas Keene|title=Scripture and Scholarship in Early Modern England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0bObTmMazAC&pg=PA131|access-date=30 May 2013|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3893-3|pages=131–3}}</ref>

===The Trinitarian controversy===
The controversy within the Church of England to which Clarke was a major contributor had been initiated by [[George Bull]], with his publication in 1685 of views on the opinions of the [[Church Fathers]] before the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325 AD). He was reacting to issues that had been raised elsewhere in Europe, by [[Petavius]], by [[Christopher Sandius]] and [[Daniel Zwicker]] for the [[Socinian]] camp, and the [[Arminian]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas C. Pfizenmaier|title=The Trinitarian Theology of Dr. Samuel Clarke (1675-1729): Context, Sources, and Controversy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OemH4jKItGQC&pg=PA179|access-date=15 September 2013|year=1997|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10719-9|page=179}}</ref>

It was only with the close discussions of Clarke and his major opponent [[Daniel Waterland]], a generation later, that the theological and historical points involved came clearly into focus. Clarke and Waterland had definite differences on the theology of [[consubstantiality]] and [[aseity]].<ref name="P215">{{cite book|author=Thomas C. Pfizenmaier|title=The Trinitarian Theology of Dr. Samuel Clarke (1675-1729): Context, Sources, and Controversy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OemH4jKItGQC&pg=PA215|access-date=15 September 2013|year=1997|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10719-9|page=215}}</ref>

Waterland argued in theology for the Anglican orthodoxy of time, in particular that the possible attitudes were, besides the orthodox [[Athanasian]] view, limited to [[Arianism]] and [[Sabellianism]]; and that the two latter were not consistent with Scripture.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas C. Pfizenmaier|title=The Trinitarian Theology of Dr. Samuel Clarke (1675-1729): Context, Sources, and Controversy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OemH4jKItGQC&pg=PA197|access-date=15 September 2013|year=1997|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10719-9|page=197}}</ref> He also championed Bull's historical claim, that the Fathers before Nicaea held the views that were orthodox after Nicaea. Clarke's resistance to both points has had support from some modern scholars.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas C.

The trajectory of the English controversy from 1712 involved at least ten writers.<ref name="P215"/> By summer 1714 the debate on ''The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity'' had ramified, and provoked a formal complaint from the [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Lower House of Convocation]]: the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]] still made it an offence for "any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the Holy Trinity". Clarke drew up an apologetic preface, and then gave explanations which satisfied the Upper House of Convocation. He had strong supporters among the bishops.<ref name="EB1911"/><ref name="Gascoigne2002"/> Clarke promised not to preach or write on the topic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas C. Pfizenmaier|title=The Trinitarian Theology of Dr. Samuel Clarke (1675-1729): Context, Sources, and Controversy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OemH4jKItGQC&pg=PA185|access-date=15 September 2013|year=1997|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10719-9|page=185}}</ref> [[Arthur Ashley Sykes]] and [[John Jackson (controversialist)|John Jackson]] from then on acted as his proxies.<ref name="ODNB"/> Other main participants in the controversy were [[John Edwards (divine)|John Edwards]], [[Francis Gastrell]], James Knight who published with Bull's biographer [[Robert Nelson (nonjuror)|Robert Nelson]],<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Knight|author2=Robert Nelson|title=The Scripture Doctrine of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity Vindicated from the Misinterpretations of Dr. Clarke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LRGenQEACAAJ|access-date=15 September 2013|year=1714|publisher=Smith|isbn=9785871321010}}</ref> Richard Mayo of [[Great Kimble]] (son of the nonconformist [[Richard Mayo (minister)|Richard Mayo]]), [[Stephen Nye]], [[Edward Welchman]] and [[Edward Wells (theologian)|Edward Wells]].<ref name="P215"/>

[[Caroline of Ansbach]], the Princess of Wales, requested that Clarke defend his views in a disputation with [[Edward Hawarden]], and it took place in 1719, in her presence. Hawarden returned to the subject in  ''Answer to Dr. Clarke and Mr. Whiston'' (1729).<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=12641|title=Hawarden, Edward|first=G.|last=Bradley}}</ref>

===Revised prayer book===
{{main|Book of Common Prayer (Unitarian)}}
By 1724, Clarke had been pressured to public retract his [[Nontrinitarianism|Nontrinitarian]] views. However, he maintained these beliefs in private.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Sleeping Habits of Matter and Spirit: Samuel Clarke and Anthony Collins on the Immortality of the Soul|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|journal=Past Imperfect|date=2001–2003|volume=9|page=5|publisher=[[University of Alberta]]|url=https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/pi/index.php/pi/article/view/1429}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://archives.gcah.org/bitstream/handle/10516/6101/MH-1996-July-Tucker.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|title=John Wesley's Prayer Book Revision: The Text in Context|last=Tucker|first=Karen B.

==Correspondence with Leibniz==
{{Main|Leibniz-Clarke correspondence}}
In 1715 and 1716 Clarke had a discussion with [[Gottfried Leibniz]] on the principles of [[natural philosophy]] and religion, which was cut short when Leibniz died. A collection of the papers which passed between them was published in 1717.<ref>[[Georg Victor Leroy]], ''Die philosophischen Probleme in dem Briefwechsel Leibniz und Clarke'', Giessen, 1893.</ref>

==Later life and death==
In 1719 Clarke was presented by [[Nicholas Lechmere, 1st Baron Lechmere]], to the mastership of [[Wigston's hospital]] in [[Leicester]]. In 1727, on the death of Sir Isaac Newton, he was offered by the court the post of [[Master of the Mint]], worth on an average from £1200 to £1500 a year. He refused the position.<ref name="EB1911"/>

On Sunday 11 May 1729, when going out to preach before the judges at [[Serjeants' Inn]], Clarke had a sudden illness. It caused his death on the Saturday following, in London.<ref name="EB1911"/>  His funeral was held at St James's on Thursday, 22 May.<ref>''The Register of Burials in the Parish of St James within the Liberty of Westminster. 1723-1754''. 22 May 1729.</ref>

==Works==
===Translations===
Clarke published a [[Latin]] version of the ''Traité de physique'' of [[Jacques Rohault]] (1617(?)-1672) with notes, which he finished before he was twenty-two. The system of Rohault was based on Cartesian principles, and was previously known only through the medium of a crude Latin version. Clarke's translation (1697) continued to be used as a text-book in the university till supplanted by the treatises of Newton. Four editions were issued, the last being that of 1718. It was translated into English in 1723 by his younger brother John, [[dean of Salisbury]].<ref name="EB1911"/>

In 1706 Clarke translated Newton's ''[[Opticks]]'' into Latin, for which the author presented him with £500. In 1709, at the request of the author, Clarke revised [[William Whiston]]'s English translation of the ''[[Apostolical Constitutions]]''. In 1712 he published an annotated edition of ''[[Caesar's Commentaries (disambiguation)|Caesar's Commentaries]]''<!--both of them-->, with engravings, dedicated to [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]].<ref name="EB1911"/>

In 1729 he published the first twelve books of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. This edition, dedicated to [[William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]], was praised by Bishop Hoadly. Three years after his death appeared also the last twelve books of the ''Iliad'', published by his son Samuel Clarke, the first three of these books and part of the fourth having, as he states, been revised and annotated by his father.<ref name="EB1911"/>

===Other works===
In 1699 Clarke published two treatises: ''Three Practical Essays on Baptism, Confirmation and Repentance'' and ''Some Reflections on that part of a book called Amyntor, or a Defence of Milton's Life, which relates to the Writings of the Primitive Fathers, and the Canon of the New Testament''. In 1701 he published ''A Paraphrase upon the Gospel of St Matthew'', which was followed, in 1702, by the ''Paraphrases upon the Gospels of St Mark and St Luke'', and soon afterwards by a third volume upon St John. They were subsequently printed together in two volumes and passed through several editions.<ref name="EB1911"/>

In 1724 Clarke published seventeen sermons, eleven of which had not before been printed. In 1728 was published "A Letter from Dr Clarke to [[Benjamin Hoadly]], F.R.S., occasioned by the controversy relating to the Proportion of Velocity and Force in Bodies in Motion," printed in the ''Philosophical Transactions''.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Soon after his death his brother, Dr [[John Clarke (dean of Salisbury)|John Clarke]], published, from his original manuscripts, ''An Exposition of the Church [[Catechism]]'', and ten volumes of [[sermon]]s. The ''Exposition'' is composed of the lectures which he read on Thursday mornings, for some months in the year, at St James's church. He revised them, and left them ready for the press.<ref name="EB1911"/>

==Moral views==
Clarke's ethical theory of "fitness" is formulated on the analogy of mathematics. He held that in relation to the will things possess an objective fitness similar to the mutual consistency of things in the physical universe. This fitness God has given to actions, as he has given laws to Nature; and the fitness is as immutable as the laws. The theory was criticized by [[Théodore Simon Jouffroy]], [[Amédée Jacques]], [[Sir James Mackintosh]], [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], and others,<ref name="EB1911"/> but substantially defended by [[John Balguy]] against [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson's]] sentimentalist case against moral rationalism. A similar form of moral rationalism is developed by the [[Cambridge Platonist]] [[Ralph Cudworth]].

==Influence==
