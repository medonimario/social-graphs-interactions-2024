==Life==
François Poullain de la Barre was born during July 1647 in Paris, France, to a family with judicial nobility.<ref name=":0" /> He added "de la Barre" to his name later in life.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|last=Shulevitz|first=Judith|date=2021-07-28|title=I Found the Feminism I Was Looking For in the Lost Writings of a 17th-Century Priest|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/09/francois-poulain-radical-feminism/619499/|access-date=2021-08-27|website=The Atlantic|language=en}}</ref> After graduation in 1663 with a master of arts, he spent three years at the [[College of Sorbonne]] where he studied theology.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Desmond|date=2013-03-26|title=François Poulain de la Barre|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/francois-barre/}}</ref> In 1679, he became an ordained [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest. From 1679 to 1688, he led two modest parishes, [[Versigny, Aisne|Versigny]] and [[La Flamengrie, Aisne|La Flamengrie]], in [[Picardy]] in northern France.<ref name=":1" />

In 1688, the Catholic Church was critical of [[Cartesianism]], a philosophy that he had embraced early in his career, causing Poullain de la Barre to leave the priesthood and [[Picardy]]. Initially, he returned to [[Paris]]. By 1689, he had moved to [[Republic of Geneva|Geneva]] where he converted to [[Calvinism]], a branch of [[Protestantism]]. The following year, he married Marie Ravier.<ref name=":1" /> After a year as a tutor, he took a position teaching at a local Genevan university. After the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] revoked the [[Edict of Nantes]], he was exiled in the [[Republic of Geneva#Republic of Geneva (1541-1798 and 1813-1815)|Republic of Geneva]], where he obtained citizenship (bourgeoisie) in 1716.<ref>[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F15874.php Poullain de la Barre, François], in the [[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]].</ref> He spent the remainder of his life in Geneva, where he died on 4 May 1723.<ref name=":0" />

During a physiology conference in 1667, a friend of Poullain de la Barre introduced him to [[Cartesianism]], the philosophy of [[René Descartes]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stuurman|first=Siep|date=October 1997|title=Social Cartesianism: Francois Poulain de la Barre and the Origins of the Enlightenment|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=58|issue=4|pages=617–640|doi=10.1353/jhi.1997.0041|jstor=3653963|s2cid=170786547}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/895078218 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/895077820 cite #2 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

Six years after his introduction to Cartesianism, Poullain de la Barre published a three part series on the condition of women. In 1673, he published ''On the Equality of the Two Sexes:'' ''A Physical and Moral Discourse, Which Shows That it is Important to Rid Oneself of  Prejudice'',<ref name=":2" /> which argues that the difference between men and women goes beyond the body, but is in the "constitution of the body". He rejected the idea that the minds of men and women differ, historically proclaiming "the mind has no sex".<ref name=":3" /> In claiming sexual difference lies in part through the "constitution of the body", Poullain de la Barre argued the unequal treatment that women experience in religious and educational instruction, and the effects of the environment, create a perceived apparent innate difference between the sexes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Broad|first=Jacqueline|date=December 2003|title=Thinking about modernity: English women philosophers and the origins of modernity|journal=Intellectual News|volume=13|issue=1|pages=27–37|doi=10.1080/15615324.2003.10427197|s2cid=21231634|issn=1561-5324}}</ref> In his assessment, this does not have a natural basis, it is not [[Essentialism|essential]], nor is it innate, but proceeds from cultural prejudice, and can be understood as [[social constructionism]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=François Poulain de la Barre and the invention of modern equality|last=Stuurman, Siep|date=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674011854|oclc=52886676}}</ref> Poullain de la Barre advocated for equal education of women, emphasizing that women should receive a true and quality education.<ref name=":4" /> He also asserted that all careers, including scientific ones, should be open to them.<ref>''[http://blog.le-miklos.eu/wp-content/Poullain-EgaliteDesDeuxSexes.pdf De l’Égalité des deux sexes, discours physique et moral où l’on voit l’importance de se défaire des préjugez]'', 2nd edition, Paris, 1679 (annotated transcript in modern French spelling)</ref>

In 1674, he published ''On the Education of Ladies:'' ''To Guide the Mind in Sciences and Morals'', continuing his reflection on the education of women, but using Socratic dialogue in his thesis. He addresses the historical constrains of the time.<ref name=":0" /> In 1675, François Poullain de la Barre published the third in his series, ''On the Excellence of Men:'' ''Against the Equality of the Sexes''". The title was sarcastic, instead the work is a rebuttal of those opposed to gender equality.<ref name=":1" />

== Responses and critiques ==
Opinions about Poullain de la Barre's place in the history of feminism vary considerably, but his theories have often been used by others, such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].<ref name=":5" /> [[Pierre Bayle]] has advanced the theory that Poullain may have refuted his own thesis because he felt threatened, but the arguments [[antifeminist]]s advanced are doubtful of this refutation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

[[Simone de Beauvoir]] includes a quotation from Poullain de la Barre in an epigraph to ''[[The Second Sex]]'' in 1949: "All that has been written about women by men should be suspect, for the men are at once judge and party."
