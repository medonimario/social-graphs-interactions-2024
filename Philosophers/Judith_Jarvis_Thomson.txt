'''Judith Jarvis Thomson''' (October 4, 1929{{spnd}}November 20, 2020) was an American philosopher who studied and worked on [[ethics]] and [[metaphysics]]. Her work ranges across a variety of fields, but she is most known for her work regarding the thought experiment titled the [[trolley problem]] and her writings on abortion. She is credited with naming, developing, and initiating the extensive literature on the trolley problem first posed by [[Philippa Foot]] which has found a wide range use since.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edmonds |first1=Dave |title=Would You Kill the Fat Man? The Trolley Problem and What Your Answer Tells Us about Right and Wrong |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780691154022 |page=35}} "Philippa Foot set Trolleyology going, but it was Judith Jarvis Thomson, a philosopher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who delivered its most high-voltage jolt. Struck by Foot's thought experiment she responded with not one but two influential articles on what she labeled ''The Trolley Problem.''"</ref> Thomson also published a paper titled "[[A Defense of Abortion]]", which makes the argument that the procedure is morally permissible even if it is assumed that a [[fetus]] is a person with a right to life.

==Early life and education==
Thomson was born in New York City, on October 4, 1929. Her mother Helen (Vostry) Jarvis<ref>Helen Vostry (1898–1935)</ref> (1898–1935) was an English teacher, and her father Theodore Richard Jarvis<ref>(1896-1984) – Theodore's name was originally Isidor Jarvitz. On May 22, 1912 he legally changed his name to Isidor Yavis. Then, at some time later, he started using the name "Theodore Jarvis". The name "Theodore" was an Americanized version of the name Isidor, and the surname "Jarvis" consisted of the letters "Jar" (the first three letters of the surname Jarvitz) combined with the letters "vis" (the last three letters of the surname Yavis).

Gertrude was Jewish and had two children.<ref name="jwa" />

Though she did not receive religious pressure from her parents, she officially converted to Judaism at age fourteen, when she was confirmed at Temple Israel in Manhattan.<ref name="jwa" />

Thomson graduated from [[Hunter College High School]] in January 1946.<ref name="jwa" /> She received her bachelor's degree (BA) from [[Barnard College]] in 1950, a second BA at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] in 1952, an [[Oxbridge MA|MA]] from Cambridge in 1956, and a PhD from [[Columbia University]] in 1959.<ref name="jwa" /> All of her degrees were in philosophy.<ref name="jwa" />

In 1960, Thomson began teaching at Barnard College.<ref name="mitobit">{{Cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=Alex|title=Professor Emerita Judith Jarvis Thomson, highly influential philosopher, dies at 91|date=December 4, 2020 |url=https://news.mit.edu/2020/professor-emerita-judith-jarvis-thomson-influential-philosopher-dies-1204|access-date=2020-12-11|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|language=en}}</ref> In 1962, she married [[James F.

Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy. James was also appointed a professor of philosophy at MIT. The Thomsons divorced in 1980; they remained colleagues until James's death in 1984.<ref name="jwa" />

==Career==
Thomson was a visiting professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] (1976), [[UC Berkeley School of Law]] (1983), and [[Yale Law School]] (1982, 1984, 1985).

Thomson was elected a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2019.

==Philosophical views==
Thomson's main areas of research were moral philosophy and [[metaphysics]].<ref>{{Cite web |author-link= Sarah McGrath |last=McGrath |first=Sarah |date=2005 |title=Thomson, Judith Jarvis (1929—) |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/thomson-judith-jarvis-1929 |access-date=2020-11-21 |website=Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> In moral philosophy she made significant contributions to [[meta-ethics]], [[normative ethics]], and [[applied ethics]].

"[[A Defense of Abortion]]" (1971) introduced one thought experiment for which Thomson is especially well known. Published in 1971, Thomson's work on abortion is historically connected to and located just prior to the court case of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. The paper asks the reader to imagine that her circulatory system has, without her consent, been connected to that of a famous violinist whose life she must sustain for nine months. The hypothetical posed by Thomson notably redirects philosophical attention from the rights of the fetus to those of the pregnant woman.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Burgis |first=Ben |date=2020-11-30 |title=Judith Jarvis Thomson (1929–2020) |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2020/11/judith-jarvis-thompson-obituary-abortion-essay |access-date=2020-12-11 |website=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] |language=en-US}}</ref> Specifically, her argument accepts that a fetus is a person, moving past any discussion which revolved around that topic. Instead, Thomson claims that the bodily autonomy of the woman supersedes any rights of the fetus. This argument has been widely discussed since, such that it is accepted in some [[anti-abortion]] circles to have changed the way in which abortion is debated.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bradley |first=Gerard |date=2016 |title=The Future of Abortion Law in the United States |journal=National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=633–653|doi=10.5840/ncbq201616460 }}</ref>

In regards to ethical theories, Thomson was opposed to consequentialist, hedonist, and subjectivist perspectives.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Zimmerman |first=Michael |title=Review of /Goodness and Advice/ by Judith Jarvis Thomson |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3506252 |journal=Noûs |volume=38 |pages=534–552 |doi=10.1111/j.0029-4624.2004.00482.x |jstor=3506252 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Brown |first=Curtis |date=July 1998 |title=Review of ''Moral Relativism and Moral Objectivity'' by Gilbert Harm, Judith Jarvis Thomson |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2660325 |journal=The Philosophical Quarterly |volume=48 |pages=387–390 |jstor=2660325}}</ref> Her work relied on specific elements of deontological argumentation.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61151356 |title=Encyclopedia of philosophy |date=2006 |publisher=Thomson Gale/Macmillan Reference USA |others=Donald M.

In metaphysics, Thomson focused on questions regarding the relationship between actions and events, and between time and physical parts.<ref>{{Citation |last=Stoljar |first=Daniel |title=Thomson, Judith Jarvis |date=2010 |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-e-968 |work=[[The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210311011659/https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-e-968?rskey=Noyr4C&result=1 |publisher=Continuum |language=en |doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001 |isbn=978-0-19-975466-3 |access-date=2021-03-11 |archive-date=March 11, 2021 |author-link=Daniel Stoljar}}</ref>
