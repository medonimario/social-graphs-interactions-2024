'''Rudolph Goclenius the Elder''' ({{langx|la|Rudolphus Goclenius}}; born ''Rudolf Gockel'' or ''Göckel''; 1 March 1547 – 8 June 1628) was a German scholastic philosopher. He is sometimes credited with coining the term ''[[psychology]]'' in 1590, though the term had been used by Pier Nicola Castellani and Gerhard Synellius 65 years earlier.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Janssen |first1=D.

==Life==
He was born in [[Korbach]], [[Waldeck (state)|Waldeck]] (now in [[Waldeck-Frankenberg]], [[Hesse]]).

Goclenius studied at the [[University of Erfurt]], the [[University of Marburg]] and the [[University of Wittenberg]],<ref>''Album Academiae Vitebergensis'', Second Volume, Halle 1894, p. 179: July 31, 1570. His last name is misspelled as "Gocleuius"; cf. {{cite web|url=http://digital.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/hd/content/pageview/2525806 |title=''Wittenberger Matrikel, Universität Wittenberg''}}</ref> earning his M.A. in 1571. Subsequently, he directed [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] in his hometown Korbach (1573)<ref>During his second stay in Wittenberg, Goclenius wrote a letter to the mayors of Korbach, dated September 16, 1572. The purpose of this letter was to negotiate a salary agreement for the directorship at Korbach Stadtschule. The complete letter, along with its German translation, is reproduced in V. Schultze, Zur Vorgeschichte des Corbacher Gymnasiums. ''Geschichtsblätter für Waldeck und Pyrmont'', 2. Band, 1902, pp. 114-119.</ref> and in [[Kassel]] ([[Michaelmas]] 1575).<ref>Weber, C. F. ''Geschichte der städtischen Gelehrtenschule zu Cassel'', Kassel 1846, p. 58.</ref> In 1581, [[Landgrave]] [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Wilhelm IV of Hesse-Kassel]], a renowned astronomer, denied Goclenius's request to return to Korbach but allowed him to become a professor at the [[Philipps University of Marburg]]. There, he held chairs in physics,<ref>Caesar, C. I. ''Catalogi studiosorum scholae Marpurgensis'' (March 22, 1879), Marburg 1879, p. 5. Goclenius was appointed on September 9, 1581 and addressed his fellow professors on the subject of physics before beginning his teaching duties.</ref>  logic, mathematics, and ethics.<ref>Gundlach, F. {{cite web|url=http://dfg-viewer.de/show/?tx_dlf[id]=http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/eb/2017/0135/mets-7528.xml |title=''Catalogus Professorum Academiae Marburgensis 1527-1910.''}} Marburg 1927, pp. 387-388. Gundlach was unable to pinpoint the exact date when Goclenius was appointed to the professorship of logic. At the end of 1589, specifically on December 18th, Goclenius was still a Physics Professor. On this day, he honored 30 students with the title of Magister. The change in his professorship is evident from his preface, dated January 13, 1590, to the ''Three Books of Philosophical Debates, on Certain Logical and Physical Questions'' (Marburg, 1590).</ref> Goclenius also served as a counselor to Wilhelm and his son [[Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Moritz]], the latter of whom sent him to the [[Synod of Dort]] in 1618.<ref>Rommel, C. v. ''Neuere Geschichte von Hessen'', Zweiter Band, Kassel 1837, pp. 586-588; Heppe, H. ''Kirchengeschichte beider Hessen'', Zweiter Band, Marburg 1876, pp. 47-53; Schäufele, W. F.

''Reformation der Kirche - Reform der Bildung'', Münster 2020, p. 216.</ref><ref>The Landgrave's instructions, dated October 1, 1618, delineated the approach and guidelines for conducting the delegate's business at the Synod. These instructions are reprinted in H. Heppe, Historia synodi nationalis Dordracenae, ''Zeitschrift für die historische Theologie'', 23. Band, 1853, pp. 231-233. Goclenius delivered a speech on January 25, 1619 in which he "accurately refuted the famous syllogism of the [[Remonstrants]] based on the principles of logic, derived from the execution of predestination." See the ''Acta Synodi Nationali'', Leiden 1620, p. 194 (French translation: ''Actes du Synode national tenu à Dordrecht, l'an 1618 et 19'', Leiden 1624, p. 371).

Vol. 1, Göttingen 2015, p. 120.</ref> In 1627, Moritz decided to allow Goclenius to retire peacefully due to his age.<ref>Caesar, C. I. ''Catalogi studiosorum scholae Marpurgensis'' (March 22, 1886), Marburg 1886, p. 24. Landgrave Moritz instructed the professors at Marburg to nominate suitable candidates for the positions of Logic and Rhetoric professors. On June 20th, 1627 the professors recommended Reverend Konrad Greber for the extraordinary professorship of Logic and Dr. Theodor Höpingk for the Rhetoric professorship.</ref>

While Goclenius is known for popularizing the term ''[[psychology]]'', his most significant contribution lies in the field of [[ontology]]. Following Aristotle's work, he gave this philosophical discipline its name and continued in Aristotle's tradition. [[Ontology]] is thought to have been further developed in the 17th century by Goclenius.<ref>Enskat, R.  "Ontology." Religion Past and Present. Brill Online, 2013.</ref>

[[Johann Balthasar Schupp]] satirically recounted that Goclenius claimed his work ''Analecta'' (published 1598 in [[Lich, Hesse|Lich]]) was the best book he had ever written.<ref>''Zugab Doct: Joh: Balth: Schuppii Schrifften'', Hanau 1667, p. 120. Cf. Vilmar, A.F.C. Kleine Nachträge zu Strieders hessischer Gelehrten- und Schriftstellergeschichte, ''Zeitschrift des Vereins für hessische Geschichte und Landeskunde'', Dritter Band, 1843, p. 210.</ref>

Jeremias Nicolai, a student at Korbach ''Stadtschule'' from Autumn 1574 onwards, brother of [[Philipp Nicolai]], reported that Goclenius "promptly" composed a poem about "fiery air phenomena" ({{Lang|de|feurige Lufterscheinungen}}) observed in the city on November 14, 1574.<ref>Curtze, L. ''D. Philipp Nicolai's Leben und Lieder'', Halle 1859, p. 17. According to Curtze this poem was added to Goclenius' ''Liber Selectiorum Carminum'' (Marburg, 1606).</ref> It was published in Marburg the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idb.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/opendigi/DkII214_qt_2 |title=''In Phasma Seu Teras Ignitum Quod Horribili Fulgore, Et vibratu quasi contorum, visum est''}}, Marburg 1574.</ref> City historian Wolfgang Medding has suggested that this poem was inspired by an [[aurora]],<ref>Medding, W. ''Korbach : Die Geschichte einer Stadt'', Korbach 1988, p. 164.</ref> a hypothesis supported by historical records of auroral observations.<ref>Frobesius, J. N. ''Nova et Antiqua Luminis Atque Aurorae Borealis Spectacula'', Helmstedt 1739, pp. 42-43; Fritz, H. ''Verzeichniss beobachteter Polarlichter'', Wien 1873, p. 22.</ref> Later, he treated auroras ("chasmata") in a 1604 physics textbook.<ref>''Physicae completae speculum'', Marburg 1604, pp. 738-744.</ref>

On the morning of Trinity Sunday, on June 8, 1628, as Goclenius was preparing to go to church, he suffered a stroke and passed away.<ref>Letter by Hermann Vultejus to Johann Peter Lotichius, in: Lotichius, J. P., ''Censura'', Frankfurt 1645, pp. 92-93; Caesar, C. I. ''Catalogi studiosorum scholae Marpurgensis'', Part 14 (March 22, 1886), Marburg 1886, p. 32.</ref> The previous day, he had dinner with Hermann Vultejus and his son-in-law Christoph Deichmann, Chancellor of Lippe. Vultejus recalled, that Goclenius was mentally sharp and articulate, just as he had been in his younger days.  After his burial, which took place two days later, Wolfgang Riemenschneider (Loriseca) gave a speech in which he praised Goclenius as "leader of today's philosophers, Marburgian Plato, European light, Hessian immortal glory".<ref>Loriseca, W. Gratiarum actio a deductis exsequiis Dn. Rodolphi Goclenii, in: ''Orationes'', Kassel 1631, pp. 239-245. First published in ''Panegyricus Acutissimo ac Celeberrimo Dn. Rodolpho Goclenio Seniori'', Marburg 1629.</ref>

==Family==
Goclenius married his first wife, Margarethe, in 1570.<ref>Strieder, 1784, p. 432.</ref> Abraham Saur, a jurist in Marburg, recorded the following in his chronicle for April 10:

{{quote|text=M. Rudolphus Goclerius [sic] holds wedding. On this day / in the year of Christ 1570 as the Sun entered the Sign of Taurus / of which Astrologers say / it is auspicious for marriage / M. Rudolphus Goclerius [sic] / a young learned Man and Poet / celebrated his wedding in Korbach.
|author=Abraham Saur
|title=Diarium Historicum (1582, p. 155; translated from German)
}}

From this marriage his oldest son, [[Rudolph Goclenius the Younger]], or Rudolf Goclenius, Jr. was born. He went on to become a professor in Marburg and a celebrated mathematician. It is thanks to Rudolph Goclenius, Jr., that a lunar crater bears his name. Additionally, he also worked on cures for the plague and gained fame for his miraculous use with the "weapon salve" or [[Powder of Sympathy]]. Among other notable descendants were Theodor Christoph Goclenius (1602–1673, medicine), Eduard Franz Goclenius (1643–1721, law) and Reinhard Goclenius (1678–1726, law).<ref>Goeckel, G. (1916).

==Philosophical attitude==
An [[epigram]] from the literary games at Kassel in December 1576, contributed by Goclenius to the physics of [[Wilhelm Adolph Scribonius]] of Marburg, emphasized the importance of logic and reason in understanding the world - a guiding motif for his work:

{{Poem quote
|text=<!-- or: 1= -->If you remove Logic, all knowledge is gone: 
And if anything remains, it's mere fable and shadow. 
Let the great lamp of Titania be extinguished: 
And you'll see everything in blind darkness. 
Take away the light of Logic and Prometheus' fire: 
And the world will be hidden in small shadows. 
Only an inert mass of undigested matter will remain, 
And chaos will reign as it did before. 
And without a standard, without law, without a certain order, 
everything that will be established by us will go.

}}

Goclenius's philosophical views aligned closely with those of [[Aristotle]]. He belonged to a group called “[[Semiramists]],” which consisted of [[Aristotelians]] advocating both dialectic interpretation of Aristotle's teachings and the exposition of [[Ramism]].<ref>Krstić, K. Marko Marulić - The author of the term "Psychology". ''Acta Instituti Psychologica Universitatis Zagrabiensis'', No. 36, p. 7.</ref><ref>Joannes Bilstenius is credited with coining the term "Philippo-Ramism" in 1588 (H. Jaumann, ''Handbuch der Gelehrtenkultur der Frühen Neuzeit'', Band 1, Berlin 2004, p. 103). Goclenius contributed an ‘Autoschediasma’ to Bilstenius’s Syntagma, which describes the path of method as illustrious and renowned, and his treatise as concise yet comprehensive, yielding genuine doctrine.</ref> While serving as a rector at Korbach ''Stadtschule'' Goclenius even composed a scholarly poem on the death of Petrus Ramus.<ref>Carmen Scholasticum De morte Petri Rami. Prefixed to: ''In Phasma Seu Teras Ignitum Quod Horribili Fulgore, Et vibratu quasi contorum, visum est'', Marburg 1574.</ref> Friedrich Beurhusius, in a letter to Johann Thomas Freigius in September 1575, mentioned Goclenius as a devoted follower of Ramus, alongside other schoolmen such as Johann Lambach and Bernhard Copius.<ref>Domino Ioanni Thomae Freigio I.V.D. Clarissimo, Fredericus Beuchusius Scholae Tremonianae Prorector S. P. D. In: ''P. Rami, Professio Regia'', Basel 1576; H. Hotson, ''Commonplace Learning: Ramism and its German Ramifications, 1543-1630'', Oxford 2007, p. 27.</ref>

In 1610, [[Johann Heinrich Alsted]] wrote a manual providing information and advice on academic studies. According to Alsted, Goclenius considered four philosophers—Aristotle, [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] (whose ''Exercitationes'' he referred to as his 'Bible'), [[Jacopo Zabarella]], and [[Jakob Schegk]]—to be essential reading (cumprimis legendos, meaning "should be read first"). He believed they should form the foundation of what he called the 'Philosophical Library.'<ref>Alsted, J. H., ''Consiliarius Academicus et Scholasticus'', Straßburg 1610, p. 33</ref> Contemporary authors have slightly modified Goclenius's wording to imply that this selection would ''suffice'' to fill all the pulpits of philosophers.<ref>Pelargus, C. ''Oratio De Libro Vitae Mystico'', Wittenberg 1612; Lansius, T. ''Commentatio De Academiis'', Tübingen 1619, p. 44. Lansius' account differs from Pelargus' in that he omits the specifics regarding Goclenius' appreciation of Scaliger.</ref> Another author felt compelled to clear up a contemporary semantic misunderstanding, according to which Goclenius' use of the word 'Bible' in relation to Scaliger's ''Exercitationes'' indicates an overestimation of reason among Calvinists.<ref>Beckmann, C. Von Rod. Goclenij Worten. In: ''Anatomia Universalis Triumphans'', Erster und Ander Theil, Frankfurt an der Oder 1674, pp. 231-232.</ref>

==Works==
In his ''Disquisitiones Philosophicae'' (Philosophical Inquiries), published in 1599, Goclenius presents a synoptic table that categorizes philosophical doctrines, or liberal arts, into distinct domains of knowledge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6o8G5bld4CYC|title=''Disquisitiones philosophicae''}} Marburg, 1599.</ref> It encompasses two main categories: '''Real Doctrines''' and '''Arts Guiding Our Understanding'''. Real Doctrines delve into objects of our understanding, including '''Universal Philosophy''' (which deals with being in general) and '''Particular Philosophy''' (addressing specific beings). Within Particular Philosophy, we find '''Theoretical''' (or '''Real''') '''Philosophy''' (studying essence and quantity) and '''Practical''' (or '''Moral''') '''Philosophy''' (focusing on ethics and politics). The practice of '''Physics''' is the '''Art of Medicine'''. The conjunction of '''Astronomy''' and '''Geography''' is '''Cosmography'''. The second category, Arts Guiding Our Understanding, includes '''Rhetoric''', '''Grammar''', and '''Logic'''. Given the diversity of his works, this classification system serves as a useful organizing principle, providing an overview of his writings. Additionally, it helps readers understand how Goclenius conceptually structured the world through his main category of Real Doctrines.

Goclenius authored over 70 books, with more than half of them published between 1589 and 1599. Furthermore, his extensive list of publications includes numerous academic [[disputation]]s.<ref>For relevant background information, see Marti, Hp. Disputation. In Ueding, G. (Hrsg.), Historisches Wörterbuch der Rhetorik, Band 2, Tübingen 1994, pp. 866-880; Freedman, J. F. Disputations in Europe in the early modern period. In: {{Cite web |title=''Hora est!

In: ''Reformation vnd Ordnung Vnser Philipsen vonn Gottes gnaden Landtgrauen zu Hessen ... Wie wir wöllen das es hinfüro mit Administration vnd verwaltung vnserer Vniuersitet zu Marpurg gehalten werden soll''. Marpurg 1565. Also in: B. Hildebrand (Hrsg.), ''Urkundensammlung über die Verfassung und Verwaltung der Universität Marburg unter Philipp dem Grossmüthigen'', Marburg 1848, p. 88.</ref>  Besides this institutional requirement, Goclenius’s conviction that truth is revealed through debate, whether with oneself or others, also played a significant role.<ref>Foreword to Disquisitiones Philosophicae (1599)</ref> Goclenius delivered three hours of lectures daily: one for the general public (pro lectione publica), one for master's students (pro magistrandis), and one for bachelor's students (pro baccalaureandis).<ref>Letter by Landgrave [[Louis IV of Hesse-Marburg|Ludwig]] to his brother [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Wilhelm]], October 4, 1581. In: H. Heppe (Hrsg.), ''Geschichte der hessischen Generalsynoden von 1568-1582''. Zweiter Band, Kassel 1847, p. 221.</ref>

Notably, he used the term 'ontology' in his ''Lexicon philosophicum'' (1613), a term originally coined by Jacob Lorhard in his ''Ogdoas Scholastica'' (1606).

=== Psychology ===
Goclenius made significant contributions that led to the knowledge field termed ‘psychology.’ Lecture notes from the University of Marburg indicate that he used the term ‘psychology’ as early as 1582 within the framework of a disciplinary classification, similar to J. T. Freigius (1574) and F. Beurhusius (1581).<ref> A. Causanias, ''Goclenius in dialecticam Rami et geographiam et sphaeram'' (1582), Hessisches Hauptstaatsarchiv Wiesbaden (HHStAW).</ref> In 1586, he presided over two academic disputations, during which the word ‘psychology’ again appeared in adjectival form as a classificatory term. Although both disputations addressed the field of psychology, they revealed distinct conceptualizations of the soul or mind. The first thesis highlights the rational powers of the soul (vis cognoscendi & eligendi) as central to the human experience. The second thesis, in contrast, denies that the rational aspect alone constitutes the form of man, suggesting a more integrated view (personaliter) of the human being.<ref>''Disputatio Philosophica'', resp. Tolmerobulus Thalassidius, Marburg 1586; ''Theses Philosophicae'', resp. Iohannes Grimmaeus jun., Marburg 1586.</ref> 

His anthology ''ΨΥΧΟΛΟΓΙΑ: hoc est, de hominis perfectione, animo, et in primis ortu hujus'', published in 1590, became the first book to feature the term 'psychology' in its title.<ref>Hatfield, G. (2019). Rationalist Roots of Modern Psychology. In Robins, S., Symons, J. & Calvo, P. (eds.) ''The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Psychology''. London, p. 4.</ref> In his dedicatory letter to Hartmann von Berlepsch, Goclenius introduced the theme of the book with an epistemological reflection. He explored the challenging and profound nature of understanding the mind (animus), the differing philosophical views on the sources of truth and knowledge, and the significance of this inquiry despite its difficulty. Regarding the question of the origin of the mind, Goclenius compiled two opposing viewpoints from treatises written between 1579 and 1589. Some suggest that souls are divinely created and placed into bodies ([[Creationism_(soul)|Creationism]]), while others argue that souls are inherited from parents ([[Traducianism]]). He encouraged readers to form their own opinions without condemning differing views. The full title of the book translates to English as 'Psychology: that is, on the perfection of man, his mind, and especially its origin—the comments and discussions of certain theologians and philosophers of our time who are shown on the following page.' In this context, the term 'psychology' refers both to the subject of inquiry ('the perfection of man, his mind, and especially its origin') and to the inquiry itself ('the comments and discussions of certain theologians and philosophers of our time').

Research over the past decades has gradually identified the sources of the treatises since the book lacks bibliographic references in the modern sense.

In the 17th century, Goclenius' ΨΥΧΟΛΟΓΙΑ was widely read and quoted by scholars such as [[Robert Burton]],<ref>''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' (1621). Part. 1, Sect. 1, Subsec. 9: "Of the Rationall Soule", p. 39.</ref> [[Daniel Sennert]],<ref>''De origine et natura animarum in brutis'' (1638, pp. 117, 189f).</ref> and [[Jakob Thomasius]].<ref>''Disputatio physica de origine animae humanae'' (1669, pp. 3, 43, 51). Multiple references are also found in a doxographical work by Thomasius' pupil Johann Vake, "Vom Ursprung Menschlicher Seelen unter Vielen Meynungen die Beste" [The best among many opinions on the origin of human souls] (1692, pp. 94, 98, 102, 105, 106, 111-112).</ref> Goclenius himself revisited his ΨΥΧΟΛΟΓΙΑ in a 1604 textbook on natural science<ref>''Physicae completae speculum'', p. 69.</ref> and in various philosophical disputations.<ref>''Progymnasma Philosophicum. De Hominis Anima'', resp. Henricus Kräudter, Marburg 1604, Thesis Prima; ''Disputatio philosophica continens duas definitionum disquisitiones'', resp. Valentinus Rimer, Marburg 1606, p. 8.</ref>

Nevertheless, historians of psychology have disagreed on whether Goclenius, with his ΨΥΧΟΛΟΓΙΑ, aimed at an innovative approach for exploring the soul or to establish psychology as an independent field.<ref>Mengal (2005), Stiening (1999, 2004, 2014); Starobinski (1980), Vidal (2011), Luccio (2013).</ref> [[Friedrich August Carus]], in 1808, had referred to Goclenius' ΨΥΧΟΛΟΓΙΑ as a ''Lehrbuch'' ('textbook'), placed in temporal succession to Casmann’s Psychologia anthropologica (1594). However, this was already disputed in the 19th century.<ref>Volkmann, W. ''Lehrbuch der Psychologie'', Erster Band, Cöthen 1875, S. 38</ref> Researchers since then have converged in their classification of this book, with some labeling it as a ''Sammelwerk'' ('collection', Schüling, 1967), ''Sammelband'' ('compilation', Stiening, 1999), or ''Anthology'' (Vidal, 2011). This, at least on a linguistic level, is more in line with the fact that Goclenius used the Latin verb 'congessi' (collect, bring together) in his dedicatory letter to Berlepsch to characterize his approach.

=== Logic ===
Goclenius' crowning achievement is his original contribution made to [[term logic]], called the Goclenian [[Polysyllogism|Sorites]].<ref>Reusch, J. P. ''Systema Logicum'', Jena 1734, p. 672 (§ 584: "Sorites ordinarius: Goclenianus"); [[Ernst Platner|Platner, E.]] ''Philosophische Aphorismen'', Erster Theil, Leipzig 1793, p. 282.</ref> In the words of the British logician [[Carveth Read]]:

<blockquote>"It is the shining merit of Goclenius to have restored the Premises of the Sorites to the usual order of Fig. I.: whereby he has raised to himself a monument more durable than brass, and secured indeed the very cheapest immortality.  How expensive, compared with this, was the method of the Ephesian incendiary!"<ref>C. Read, M.A., Logic, Deductive and Inductive, (Grant Richards, London: 1898), p. 119.</ref>
</blockquote>

An example for the use of sorites in an argumentative context is presented by Goclenius in his "Dissertatio De Ortu Animi" which concludes the first edition of the ''Psychologia''.<ref>Goclenius (1590, pp. 302-304); Ragozin (2018, p. 108); see also, De Angelis (2002, pp. 97-98).</ref>

Contrary to Carveth Read's assessment, however, Dr. Rudolph Goclenius did not invent the Goclenian Sorites: St. Thomas Aquinas did:

<blockquote>"[A] second demonstration takes as its starting point the conclusion of a first demonstration, whose terms are understood to contain the middle term which was the starting point of the first demonstration. Thus the second demonstration will proceed from four terms the first from three only, the third from five, and the fourth from six; so that each demonstration adds one term. Thus it is clear that first demonstrations are included in subsequent ones, as when this first demonstration—every B is A, every C is B, therefore every C is A—is included in this demonstration—every C is A, every D is C, therefore every D is A; and this again is included in the demonstration whose conclusion is that every E is A, so that for this final conclusion there seems to be one [[syllogism]] composed of several syllogisms having several middle terms.

Bibliographies of Goclenius's writings were compiled by Friedrich Wilhelm Strieder (''Grundlage zu einer hessischen Gelehrten und Schriftsteller Geschichte,'' Bd. 4, Göttingen 1784, pp.&nbsp;428–487; Bd. 9, Cassel 1794, p.&nbsp;381; Bd. 13, Cassel 1802, pp.&nbsp;341–343; Bd. 15, Cassel 1806, p. 338) and Franz Joseph Schmidt (''Materialien zur Bibliographie von Rudolph Goclenius sen. (1547-1628) und Rudolph Goclenius jun. (1572-1621)'', Hamm 1979). Schmidt was a historian of medicine based in Hamm (Westphalia). His bibliography is organized into five groups: scientific works, academic writings, occasional writings, writings with Goclenius as editor or author of a foreword, and writings listed in the catalogue of the British Library but not in Strieder's Dictionary. Strieder’s bibliography is arranged chronologically.

* ''Oratio de natura sagarum in purgatione & examinatione per Frigidam aquis innatantium'', Marburg 1584. [A speech delivered at a graduation ceremony on November 19, 1583; republished in ''Panegyrici Academiae Marpurgensis'', Marburg 1590, pp. 190–203; and again, slightly shortened and with typographical errors, in Otto Melander’s ''Resolutio praecipuarum quaestionum criminalis adversus sagas processus'', Lich 1597. The reprint in Melander’s book is preceded by a letter from Goclenius to Melander. In the letter, Goclenius expresses his approval of Melander’s work refuting the practice of witch purgation by cold water. He mentions that he was once tasked by William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, through his Chancellor, to investigate the physical causes of witches floating, which led him to compose a speech on the subject.]
