'''Salomon Maimon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|m|ɒ|n}}; {{IPA|de|ˈmaɪmoːn|lang}}; {{langx|lt|Salomonas Maimonas}}; {{langx|he|שלמה בן יהושע מימון}}&lrm; ''Shlomo ben Yehoshua Maimon''; 1753 – 22 November 1800) was a philosopher born of [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] parentage in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], present-day [[Belarus]]. Some of his work was written in the German language.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Salomon Maimon was born '''Shlomo ben Joshua'''<ref name="IEP"/> in the town of [[Zhukov Borok]] near [[Mir, Belarus|Mir]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (present-day [[Belarus]]), where his grandfather leased an estate from a Prince [[Karol Stanisław "Panie Kochanku" Radziwiłł]]. He was taught [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]], first by his father, and later by instructors in Mir. He was recognized as a prodigy in Talmudic studies.  His parents fell on hard times, and betrothed him to two separate girls in order to take advantage of their dowries, leading to a bitter rivalry. At the age of eleven he was married to one of the two prospects, a girl from [[Nesvizh]]. At the age 14 he was already a father and was making money by teaching Talmud. Later he learned some German from books and walked all the way to [[Slonim]], where he met a rabbi named [[Shimshon ben Mordechai of Slonim]] who had studied in Germany. He borrowed German books on physics, optics and medicine from him. After that he became determined to study further.

===Interest in Kabbalah===
Maimon describes how he took an interest in [[Kabbalah]], and made a pilgrimage to the court of the [[Maggid of Mezritch]] around 1770.<ref name="Stanford">{{cite book|last=Thielke|first=Peter|title=Salomon Maimon|year=2023 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/maimon/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> He ridiculed the Maggid's adherents for their enthusiasm, and charged the Maggid with manipulating his followers.<ref name="socher">{{cite book|last = Socher|first = Abraham P.|title = The Radical Enlightenment of Solomon Maimon: Judaism, Heresy, and Philosophy|year = 2006|publisher = Stanford University Press|isbn = 0804751366}}</ref>{{rp|30}} He also wrote that the Maggid's ideas are "closer to correct ideas of religion and morals" than those he was taught in [[cheder]].<ref name="socher" />{{rp|30}}"

===In Germany===
In his mid-twenties Maimon left his home area in the direction of the German-speaking lands. His first attempt to take up residence in [[Berlin]] in 1778 failed. He was expelled for possession of a draft of a commentary on the ''[[Guide of the Perplexed|Moreh Nebukhim]]'' of [[Maimonides]]. A later attempt to convert to [[Protestantism]] in Hamburg failed due to admitted lack of belief in Christian dogma.<ref>''Solomon Maimon: An Autobiography'', trans. J. Clark Murray, University of Illinois Press, 2001.</ref> His second attempt to settle in Berlin in 1780 succeeded; he established a close connection with [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and entered the circles of the ''[[Haskalah]]'' (the Jewish Enlightenment movement) in Berlin.<ref name="Stanford"/> Mendelssohn introduced him to some wealthy Jews in Berlin, upon whom Maimon relied for [[patronage]] while he pursued his studies. He devoted himself to the study of philosophy along the lines of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] and Mendelssohn.

In 1783, Mendelssohn asked Maimon to leave Berlin due to Maimon's open [[Spinozism]]. After a journey to [[Hamburg]], [[Amsterdam]] and then back to Hamburg, he started attending the [[Gymnasium Christianeum]] in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]. During his stay there he improved his knowledge of the natural sciences and his command of German. In 1785, Maimon left for Berlin (where he met Mendelssohn for the last time), then moved to [[Dessau]], and then settled in [[Breslau]], where he attempted to study medicine but eventually took up the position of a tutor.

After many years of separation, Maimon's wife, Sarah, accompanied by their eldest son, David, managed to locate him in Breslau. She demanded that he either return to their home in Lithuania or give her a divorce. Maimon eventually agreed to the divorce.

It was not until 1787 in Berlin that Maimon became acquainted with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian philosophy, and in 1790 he published the ''Essay on Transcendental Philosophy'' (''Versuch über die Transcendentalphilosophie''), in which he formulated his objections to Kant's system. Kant seems to have considered Maimon one of his most astute critics.<ref name="Stanford"/> Maimon published a commentary on the ''Moreh Nebuchim [מורה נבוכים]'' of Maimonides in 1791 (''Gibeath Hamore [גבעת המורה]'', ''The Hill of the Guide''). In 1792/3 he published his ''Autobiography'' (''Lebensgeschichte'').

===In Silesia===
In 1795, Maimon found a peaceful residence in the house of Count von Kalckreuth (1766–1830),<ref>Variant spellings: (1) Count von Calckreuth (2) Count von Kalkreuth (12 December 1766 – 27 March 1830). His full name is usually given as Heinrich Wilhelm Adolf (or Adolph), Graf (Count) von Kalckreuth, but he was also known as Hans Wilhelm Adolf (or Adolph), Graf von Kalckreuth. He was a Prussian diplomat and author. He wrote books on taxation, law, and on various philosophical topics, including the philosophy of law. For a list of some of his writings see: https://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/viaf-269163381</ref> a young Silesian nobleman, and moved to the latter's estate in [[Nieder-Siegersdorf|Siegersdorf]], near Freistadt in Niederschlesien (Lower Silesia). Maimon died there at the age of 48 from apparent alcoholism.<ref>Elon, Amos. ''The pity of it all. A portrait of the German-Jewish Epoch, 1743–1933''. Picador, A metropolitan book.

==Thought==

===Thing-in-itself===
He seizes upon the fundamental incompatibility of a [[consciousness]] which can apprehend, and yet is separated from, the [[thing-in-itself]]. That which is object of thought cannot be outside consciousness; just as in [[mathematics]] "–1" is an unreal quantity, so things-in-themselves are ''ex hypothesi'' outside consciousness, i.e. are unthinkable. The Kantian [[paradox]] he explains as the result of an attempt to explain the origin of the given in consciousness. The [[substantial form|form]] of things is admittedly [[Subjectivity|subjective]]; the [[mind]] endeavours to explain the material of the given in the same terms, an attempt which is not only impossible but involves a denial of the elementary laws of thought. Knowledge of the given is, therefore, essentially incomplete. Complete or perfect [[knowledge]] is confined to the domain of pure thought, to [[logic]] and [[mathematics]]. Thus the problem of the thing-in-itself is dismissed from the inquiry, and philosophy is limited to the sphere of pure thought.

===Application of the categories===
The Kantian categories are demonstrable and [[Truth|true]], but their application to the given is meaningless and unthinkable. By this critical [[sceptic]]ism Maimon takes up a position intermediate between Kant and [[David Hume|Hume]]. Hume's attitude to the [[empirical]] is entirely supported by Maimon. The causal [[concept]], as given by experience, expresses not a necessary objective order of things, but an ordered scheme of [[perception]]; it is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and cannot be postulated as a concrete law apart from [[consciousness]].

===Doctrine of differentials===
Whereas Kant posed a dualism between understanding and sensibility, or between concepts and the given, Maimon refers both these faculties back to a single source of cognition. Sensibility, in Maimon's view, is therefore not completely without conceptual content, but is generated according to rules that Maimon calls [[Differential (mathematics)|differentials]]. In calling them this, Maimon is referring to the differentials from the calculus, which are entities that despite being neither qualitative nor quantitative, can nevertheless give rise to a determinate quantity and quality when related to other differentials. The operations of the faculty of sensibility are for Maimon therefore not principally different from those of mathematical intuition: seeing the color red is the same procedure as drawing a geometrical figure such as a line in a circle in thought. The reason that qualities are nevertheless 'given' is that it is only an infinite understanding that can grasp the rules for the generation of qualities in the way that a human understanding can grasp the rules for drawing a circle.

===Kant's comments===
Kant had received the first chapter of Maimon's book in manuscript from [[Markus Herz]]. In a letter to Herz from 26 May 1789, Kant writes the following:

<blockquote>"I had half decided to send the manuscript back in its immediately .... But one glance at the work made me realize its excellence and that not only had none of my critics understood me and the main questions as well as Herr Maimon does but also very few men possess so much acumen for such deep investigations as he..."<ref>* Kant, Immanuel. '' Correspondence''. Translated and edited by A. Zweig. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999, pp. 311-311.</ref></blockquote>

Nevertheless, Kant does not agree with Maimon's assessment. For Kant, the question of the relationship of the faculties is adequately answered by the Transcendental Deduction, in which Kant argues that the categories make experience possible. Furthermore, as an explanation of the harmony of the faculties, Kant offers the Leibnizian account of a [[pre-established harmony]].
