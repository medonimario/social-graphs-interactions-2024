==Philosophical views==
Barnes holds that our modern notion of the [[scientific method]] is "thoroughly [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]."  He emphasizes the point in order to refute empiricists [[Francis Bacon]] and [[John Locke]], who thought they were breaking with the Aristotelian tradition.  He claims that the "outrageous" charges against Aristotle were brought by men who did not read Aristotle's own works with sufficient attention and who criticized him for the faults of his successors.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=137}}
