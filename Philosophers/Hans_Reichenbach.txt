'''Hans Reichenbach''' (September 26, 1891 – April 9, 1953) was a leading [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], [[educator]], and proponent of [[Logical positivism|logical empiricism]]. He was influential in the areas of [[science]], [[education]], and of logical empiricism. He founded the ''Gesellschaft für empirische Philosophie'' (Society for Empirical Philosophy) in Berlin in 1928, also known as the "[[Berlin Circle]]". [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[Richard von Mises]], [[David Hilbert]] and [[Kurt Grelling]] all became members of the Berlin Circle.

In 1930, Reichenbach and [[Rudolf Carnap]] became editors of the journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]''. He also made lasting contributions to the study of [[empiricism]] based on a [[theory of probability]]; the [[Mathematical logic|logic]] and the [[philosophy of mathematics]]; [[space]], [[time]], and [[relativity theory]]; analysis of [[probabilistic]] [[reasoning]]; and [[quantum mechanics]].<ref name=AS&C>{{cite web | title = Guide to the Hans Reichenbach Papers, 1884-1972 ASP.1973.01 |url=https://digital.library.pitt.edu/islandora/object/pitt%3AUS-PPiU-asp197301/from_search/8a5eed6f9402214bc1c343ecec8bec72-0 |work=ULS Archives & Special Collections |publisher=University of Pittsburgh | access-date = 2015-12-01}}</ref> In 1951, he authored ''[[The Rise of Scientific Philosophy]]'', his most popular book.<ref name=:0/><ref name=:1/>

==Early life==
Hans was the second son of a Jewish merchant, Bruno Reichenbach, who had converted to [[Protestantism]]. He married Selma Menzel, a school mistress, who came from a long line of Protestant professionals which went back to the [[Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salmon |first1=W.

His younger brother, [[Herman Reichenbach|Herman]] was a music educator.

After completing secondary school in [[Hamburg]], Hans Reichenbach studied civil [[engineering]] at the [[Hochschule für Technik Stuttgart]], and [[physics]], [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]] at various universities, including [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], [[University of Erlangen|Erlangen]], [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[University of Munich|Munich]]. Among his teachers were [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Max Planck]], [[Max Born]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]].

==Political activism==
Reichenbach was active in [[German youth movement|youth movements]] and student organizations. He joined the [[Freistudentenschaft]] in 1910.<ref name="Milkov and Peckhaus">{{cite book |last1=Milkov |first1=Nikolay |last2=Peckhaus |first2=Volker |title=The Berlin Group and the Philosophy of Logical Empiricism |date=2013 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |location=Heidelberg |isbn=978-94-007-5485-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZVEAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA99 |language=en}}</ref> He attended the founding conference of the [[Freideutsche Jugend]] umbrella group at [[Hoher Meissner]] in 1913. He published articles about the university reform, the freedom of research, and against [[anti-Semitic]] infiltrations in student organizations.  His older brother Bernard shared in this activism and went on to become a member of the [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany]], representing this organisation on the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]]. Hans wrote the Platform of the [[Socialist Student Party, Berlin]] which was published in 1918.<ref name="SSP">{{cite book |last1=Reichenbach |first1=Hans |chapter=Report of the Socialist Student Party, Berlin |title=Hans Reichenbach Selected Writings 1909–1953 |pages=181–185 |date=1978 |doi=10.1007/978-94-009-9761-5_10 |isbn=978-90-277-0292-0 }}</ref> The party had remained clandestine until the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|November Revolution]] when it was formally founded with him as chairman.

However following his attending lectures by Albert Einstein in 1919, he stopped participating in political groups.<ref name="Mcadam">{{cite web |last1=Mcadam |first1=Roger Michael |title=Hans Reichenbach: philosopher-engineer |url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/5763/1/5763_3179.PDF |website=Durham e-Theses |publisher=Durham University |access-date=16 April 2019}}</ref>

==Academic career==
Reichenbach received a degree in [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Erlangen]] in 1915 and his [[PhD dissertation]] on the [[theory of probability]], titled ''Der Begriff der Wahrscheinlichkeit für die mathematische Darstellung der Wirklichkeit'' (''The Concept of Probability for the Mathematical Representation of Reality'') and supervised by [[Paul Hensel]] and [[Max Noether]], was published in 1916. Reichenbach served during [[World War I]] on the Russian front, in the German army radio troops. In 1917 he was removed from active duty, due to an illness, and returned to [[Berlin]]. While working as a physicist and engineer, Reichenbach attended [[Albert Einstein]]'s lectures on the [[theory of relativity]] in [[Berlin]] from 1917 to 1920.

In 1920 Reichenbach began teaching at the [[Technische Hochschule Stuttgart]] as ''[[Privatdozent]]''. In the same year, he published his first book (which was accepted as his [[habilitation]] in physics at the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart) on the philosophical implications of the [[theory of relativity]], ''The Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge'' (''Relativitätstheorie und Erkenntnis Apriori''), which criticized the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] notion of [[Analytic–synthetic distinction|synthetic]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. He subsequently published ''Axiomatization of the Theory of Relativity'' (1924), ''From Copernicus to Einstein'' (1927) and ''The Philosophy of Space and Time'' (1928), the last stating the logical positivist view on the theory of relativity.

Reichenbach distinguishes between axioms of connection and of coordination. Axioms of connection are those scientific laws which specify specific relations between specific physical things, like [[Maxwell’s equations]]. They describe empirical laws. Axioms of coordination are those laws which describe all things and are [[a priori]], like [[Euclidean geometry]] and are “general rules according to which the connections take place”. For example the axioms of connection of gravitational [[equations]] are based upon the axioms of coordination of [[arithmetic]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Padovani |first1=Flavia |title=Relativizing the relativized a priori: Reichenbach's axioms of coordination divided |journal=Synthese |date=July 2011 |volume=181 |issue=1 |pages=41–62|doi=10.1007/s11229-009-9590-0 }}</ref>

Another distinction of his was between the 'context of discovery' and 'context of justification'. The way scientists come up with ideas is not always the same as the way they justify them, and so as separate objects of study Reichenbach distinguished between them.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Science Education |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |pages=229–232}}</ref>

In 1926, with the help of Albert Einstein, Max Planck and [[Max von Laue]], Reichenbach became assistant professor in the physics department of the University of Berlin. He gained notice for his methods of teaching, as he was easily approached and his courses were open to discussion and debate. This was highly unusual at the time, although the practice is nowadays a common one.

In 1928, Reichenbach founded the so-called "[[Berlin Circle]]" ({{langx|de|Die Gesellschaft für empirische Philosophie}}; {{langx|en|Society for Empirical Philosophy}}). Among its members were [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[Richard von Mises]], David Hilbert and [[Kurt Grelling]]. The [[Vienna Circle]] manifesto lists 30 of Reichenbach's publications in a bibliography of closely related authors. In 1930 he and [[Rudolf Carnap]] began editing the journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]''.

When [[Adolf Hitler]] became [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, Reichenbach was immediately dismissed from his appointment at the University of Berlin under the government's so called "Race Laws" due to his Jewish ancestry. Reichenbach himself did not practise Judaism, and his mother was a German Protestant, but he nevertheless suffered problems. He thereupon emigrated to [[Turkey]], where he headed the department of philosophy at [[Istanbul University]]. He introduced [[interdisciplinary]] seminars and courses on scientific subjects, and in 1935 he published ''The Theory of Probability''.

In 1938, with the help of [[Charles W. Morris]], Reichenbach moved to the [[United States]] to take up a professorship at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in its [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|Philosophy Department]]. Reichenbach helped establish UCLA as a leading philosophy department in the United States in the post-war period. [[Carl Hempel]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[Wesley Salmon]] were perhaps his most prominent students. During his time there, he published several of his most notable books, including ''Philosophic Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'' in 1944, ''Elements of Symbolic Logic'' in 1947, and ''[[The Rise of Scientific Philosophy]]'' (his most popular book) in 1951.<ref name=:0>{{cite book |last1=Salmon |first1=W. C. |title=Hans Reichenbach: Logical Empiricist |date=2012 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-94-009-9404-1 | page=721 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=:1>[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Printonly/Reichenbach.html MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]</ref>

Reichenbach died unexpectedly of a heart attack on April 9, 1953. He was living in Los Angeles at the time, and had been working on problems in the [[Philosophy of space and time|philosophy of time]] and on the nature of [[scientific law]]s. As part of this he proposed a three part model of time in language, involving speech time, event time and — critically — reference time, which has been used by linguists since for describing [[grammatical tense|tenses]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Derczynski|first=L|author2=Gaizauskas, R|title=Empirical Validation of Reichenbach's Tense Framework|journal=Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Semantics|year=2013|url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/sigsem.html|access-date=2013-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027054515/http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/sigsem.html|archive-date=2016-10-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>  This work resulted in two books published posthumously: ''The Direction of Time'' and ''Nomological Statements and Admissible Operations''.
