'''Andrea Rita Dworkin''' (September 26, 1946 – April 9, 2005) was an American [[radical feminist]] writer and activist best known for her analysis of [[Anti-pornography feminism|pornography]]. Her feminist writings, beginning in 1974, span 30 years. They are found in a dozen solo works: nine books of non-fiction, two novels, and a collection of short stories. Another three volumes were co-written or co-edited with US constitutional law professor and feminist activist [[Catharine A. MacKinnon]].

The central objective of Dworkin's work is analyzing [[Western society]], culture, and politics through the prism of men's sexual violence against women in a [[patriarchal]] context. She wrote on a wide range of topics including the lives of [[Joan of Arc]],<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1987|pp=103–133}}</ref> [[Margaret Chant-Papandreou|Margaret Papandreou]],<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|pp=153–161}}</ref> and [[Nicole Brown Simpson]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-01-29-op-25763-story.html|title=Disorder in the Court : THE ABUSE : In Nicole Brown Simpson's Words|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|date=1995|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> she analyzed the literature of [[Charlotte Brontë]],<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|pp=68–87}}</ref> [[Jean Rhys]],<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|pp=87–94}}</ref> [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Kōbō Abe]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[James Baldwin]], and [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]];<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1987||pp=3–100}}</ref> she brought her own radical feminist perspective to her examination of subjects historically written or described from men's point of view, including [[fairy tale]]s, homosexuality,<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1978a|pp=107–146}}</ref> lesbianism,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/OurBloodII.html|title=Lesbian Pride|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|date=1975|website=No Status Quo}}</ref> virginity,<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1987|pp=103–151|chapter=Virginity}}</ref> [[Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel, and Women's Liberation|antisemitism, the State of Israel]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/IsraelI.html|title=Israel: Whose Country Is It Anyway?|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|date=1990|website=No Status Quo}}</ref> [[the Holocaust]], biological superiority,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIIID.html|title=Biological Superiority: The World's Most Dangerous and Deadly Idea|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|date=1977|website=No Status Quo}}</ref> and racism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whisnant|first=Rebecca|date=September 2016|title=Our Blood: Andrea Dworkin on Race, Privilege, and Women's Common Condition|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306421521|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|volume=58|pages=68–76|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2016.07.004|via=Research Gate}}</ref> She interrogated premises underlying concepts such as [[freedom of the press]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIVE.html|title=For Men, Freedom of Speech; For Women, Silence Please|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|date=1979|website=No Status Quo}}</ref> and [[civil liberties]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIVD.html|title=The ACLU: Bait and Switch|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|date=1981|website=No Status Quo}}</ref> She theorized the sexual politics of intelligence,<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1978a|pp=37–69|chapter=The Politics of Intelligence}}</ref> fear, courage,<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1976|pp=50–65}}</ref> and integrity.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1987|pp=127–128}}</ref> She described a male supremacist political ideology manifesting in and constituted by rape,<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1976|pp=22–49}}</ref> battery,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIIIB.html|title=A Battered Wife Survives|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|date=1978b|website=No Status Quo}}</ref> prostitution,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/MichLawJourI.html|title=Prostitution and Male Supremacy|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|date=1993|website=No Status Quo}}</ref> and pornography.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIVH.html|title=Pornography and Male Supremacy|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|date=1981|website=No Status Quo}}</ref>

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Andrea Dworkin was born on September 26, 1946, in [[Camden, New Jersey]], to Harry Dworkin and Sylvia Spiegel. Her father was the grandson of a [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jew]] who fled Russia when he was 15 years old in order to escape military service, and her mother was the child of Jewish immigrants from [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungary]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Shalvi|first1=Alice|author-link1=Alice Shalvi|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/dworkin-andrea |title=Andrea Dworkin, 1946–2005 |encyclopedia=Jewish Women Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Jewish Women's Archive]] |access-date=December 28, 2012}}</ref> She had one younger brother, Mark. Her father was a school teacher and dedicated [[socialist]], whom she credited with inspiring her passion for [[social justice]]. Her relationship with her mother was strained, but Dworkin later wrote that her mother's belief in legal [[birth control]] and abortion, "long before these were respectable beliefs", inspired her later activism.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|p=23}}</ref>

Though she described her Jewish household as being in many ways dominated by the memory of the Holocaust, it nonetheless provided a happy childhood until she reached the age of nine, when an unknown man [[child sexual abuse|molested]] her in a movie theater. When Dworkin was ten, her family moved from the city to the suburbs of [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]] (then known as Delaware Township), which she later wrote she "experienced as being [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] by aliens and taken to a penal colony".<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1997|p=3}}</ref> In sixth grade, the administration at her new school punished her for refusing to sing "[[Silent Night]]" (as a Jew, she objected to being forced to sing Christian religious songs at school).<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|pp=21–22}}</ref> She said she "probably would have become a rabbi" if women could have while she was in high school and she "would have liked" being a [[Talmud]]ic scholar.<ref>[[Norah Vincent|Vincent, Norah]], ''Sex, Love and Politics: Andrea Dworkin'', in ''New York Press'', vol. 11, no. 5, Feb. 4–10, 1998, p.&nbsp;42, col.&nbsp;1 (main title and subtitle may have been in either order, per ''id.'', p. [1]).</ref>

Dworkin began writing poetry and fiction in the sixth grade.<ref name="LifeDeath232428-Heartbreak3740">{{harvnb|Dworkin|1997|pp=23–24, 28}}; {{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|pp=37–40}}</ref> Around that time, she was undecided about whether to become a lawyer or a writer, because of her interest then in abortion, and chose writing because she could "do it in a room alone" and "nobody could stop me".<ref>Both quotations: Vincent, Norah, ''Sex, Love and Politics'', ''op. cit.'', p.&nbsp;42, col.&nbsp;4.</ref> Throughout high school, she read avidly, with encouragement from her parents. She was particularly influenced by [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Che Guevara]], and the [[Beat generation|Beat poets]], especially [[Allen Ginsberg]],<ref name="LifeDeath232428-Heartbreak3740" /> and has included among writers she "admired most" [[Jean Genet]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and [[Lord Byron]].<ref>Vincent, Norah, ''Sex, Love and Politics'', ''op. cit.'', p.&nbsp;42, col.&nbsp;4 (quoting interviewer Vincent).</ref> She graduated in 1964 from what is now [[Cherry Hill High School West]].<ref>Strauss, Robert. [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/business/a-50th-high-school-reunion-and-a-generation-to-follow-.html "A 50th High School Reunion, and a Generation to Follow"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 19, 2014. Accessed October 29, 2018. "Today the drive-in spot is occupied by the Crowne Plaza hotel, where the Worthingtons, along with about 100 former classmates, gathered on a recent Saturday night for the 50th reunion of their Cherry Hill High School West graduating class..... On the 'In Memory' board with 54 other deceased classmates was Andrea Dworkin, the feminist known for her writings against pornography."</ref>

=== College and early activism ===
In 1965, while a freshman at [[Bennington College]], Dworkin was arrested during an anti-[[Vietnam War]] protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations and sent to the [[New York Women's House of Detention]], known for housing renowned leftist women.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gvshp.org/blog/2018/01/29/the-womens-house-of-detention/|title=The Women's House of Detention|last=Apmann|first=Sarah Bean|date=January 29, 2018|website=The blog of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation}}</ref> After writing to the Commissioner of Corrections Anna Cross, Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House of Detention gave her an [[internal examination]] which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a [[grand jury]] about her experience, and the media coverage of her testimony made national and international news.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|pp=77–81}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1965/03/06/archives/inquiry-ordered-at-womens-jail-mrs-kross-acts-in-case-of-a.html |title=Inquiry Ordered at Women's Jail; Mrs. Kross Acts in Case of a Bennington Student Seized in U.N. Protest |first=William E. |last=Farrell |journal=The New York Times |date=March 6, 1965 |access-date=February 4, 2013 }} {{subscription required}}</ref> The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public outrage over the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|p=80}}</ref>

Soon after testifying before the grand jury, Dworkin left Bennington College on the ocean liner ''[[Castel Felice]]'' to live in Greece and to pursue her writing.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|pp=80, 83}}</ref> She traveled from Paris to Athens on the [[Orient Express]], and went to live and write on the island of [[Crete]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|pp=83–85, 87}}</ref> While there, she wrote a series of poems titled ''(Vietnam) Variations'', a collection of poems and [[prose poetry|prose poems]] that she printed on the island in a book called ''Child'' (1965), and a novel in a style resembling [[magical realism]] called ''Notes on Burning Boyfriend''—a reference to [[Norman Morrison]], a [[pacifist]] who had [[Self-immolation|burned himself to death]] in protest of the Vietnam War. She also wrote several poems and dialogues which she hand-printed after returning to the United States; these became the book ''Morning Hair'' (1967).<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|p=98}}</ref>

It was during those years that she produced two books of poetry, ''Child'' (1965) and ''Morning Hair'' (1967). After living in Crete, Dworkin returned to Bennington College for two years, where she continued to study literature and participated in campaigns against the college's student conduct code, for [[contraception]] on campus, for the legalization of abortion, and against the Vietnam War.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|pp=107–112}}</ref> She graduated with a [[Bachelor's degree]] in literature in 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/arts/andrea-dworkin-writer-and-crusading-feminist-dies-at-58.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Andrea Dworkin, Writer and Crusading Feminist, Dies at 58|author=Fox, Margalit|language=en-US|url-status=live|date=April 12, 2005|access-date=March 29, 2024|archive-date=March 14, 2022|archive-url=https://archive.today/20220314174949/https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/arts/andrea-dworkin-writer-and-crusading-feminist-dies-at-58.html}}</ref>

=== Life in the Netherlands ===
After graduation, Dworkin moved to [[Amsterdam]] to interview Dutch [[anarchism|anarchists]] in the [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] movement, which used theatrical street [[Happening|happenings]] to instigate change.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1997|pp=24–25}}; {{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|p=117}}</ref> While there, she became involved with one of the anarchists, Cornelius (Iwan) Dirk de Bruin,<ref>[https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/resources/5977 ''Dworkin, Andrea. Videotape Collection of Andrea Dworkin, 1981–1998 (Inclusive): A Finding Aid'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard Univ. (Vt-136), Feb., 2009)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106225733/https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/resources/5977 |date=November 6, 2018 }}, as accessed October 18, 2018.</ref> and they married. Soon after, she says that de Bruin began to [[domestic violence|abuse her]] severely, punching and kicking her, burning her with cigarettes, beating her on her legs with a wooden beam, and banging her head against the floor until he knocked her unconscious.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|p=119}}; {{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|pp=103, 332}}</ref>

After she left de Bruin late in 1971, Dworkin said her ex-husband attacked, persecuted, and harassed her, beating her and threatening her whenever he found where she was hiding. She found herself desperate for money, often homeless, thousands of miles from her family, later remarking that "I often lived the life of a fugitive, except that it was the more desperate life of a [[battered woman]] who had run away for the last time, whatever the outcome."<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1997|p=17}}</ref> Due to poverty, Dworkin turned to prostitution for a period.<ref name=Doubts/> Ricki Abrams, a feminist and fellow [[expatriate]], sheltered Dworkin in her home and helped her find places to stay on houseboats, a communal farm, and in deserted buildings.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1997|pp=18–19}}</ref> Dworkin tried to work up the money to return to the United States.

Abrams introduced Dworkin to early [[radical feminist]] writing from the United States, and Dworkin was notably inspired by [[Kate Millett]]'s ''[[Sexual Politics]]'', [[Shulamith Firestone]]'s ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'', and [[Robin Morgan]]'s ''[[Sisterhood Is Powerful]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1997|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|p=118}}</ref> She and Abrams began to work together on "early pieces and fragments" of a radical feminist text on the hatred of women in culture and history,<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1974||loc=Acknowledgment, p. 7}}</ref> including a completed draft of a chapter on the pornographic [[counterculture]] magazine ''Suck'', which was published by a group of fellow expatriates in the Netherlands.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1997|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|p=122}}</ref>

Dworkin later wrote that she eventually agreed to help smuggle a briefcase of heroin through customs in return for $1,000 and an airplane ticket, thinking that if she was successful she could return home with the ticket and the money, and if caught she would at least escape her ex-husband's abuse by going to prison. The deal for the briefcase fell through, but the man who had promised Dworkin the money gave her the airline ticket anyway, and she returned to the United States in 1972.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|pp=332–333}}; {{harvnb|Dworkin|1997|p=22}}</ref>

Before she left Amsterdam, Dworkin spoke with Abrams about her experiences in the Netherlands, the emerging feminist movement, and the book they had begun to write together. Dworkin agreed to complete the book—which she eventually titled ''[[Woman Hating]]''—and publish it when she reached the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1997|p=22}}</ref> In her memoirs, Dworkin relates that during that conversation, she vowed to dedicate her life to the feminist movement:

{{blockquote|Sitting with Ricki, talking with Ricki, I made a vow to her: that I would use everything I knew, including from prostitution, to make the women's movement stronger and better; that I'd give my life to the movement and for the movement. I promised to be honor-bound to the well-being of women, to do anything necessary for that well-being. I promised to live and to die if need be for women. I made that vow some thirty years ago, and I have not betrayed it yet.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|p=122}}.</ref>}}

=== Return to New York and contact with the feminist movement ===
In New York City, Dworkin worked again as an anti-war organizer, participated in demonstrations for [[lesbian rights]] and against [[apartheid]] in South Africa.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|p=123}}</ref> The feminist poet [[Muriel Rukeyser]] hired her as an assistant. Dworkin later said, "I was the worst assistant in the history of the world. But Muriel kept me on because she believed in me as a writer."<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|p=3}}</ref> Dworkin also joined a feminist [[consciousness raising]] group,<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|p=124}}</ref> and soon became involved in radical feminist organizing, focusing on campaigns against men's violence against women. In addition to her writing and activism, Dworkin gained notoriety as a speaker, mostly for events organized by local feminist groups.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|pp=139–143}}</ref> She became well known for passionate, uncompromising speeches that aroused strong feelings in both supporters and critics, and inspired her audience to action, such as her speech at the first organisational [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] march in November 1978 (led by [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media|WAVPM]]), and her 1983 speech at the Midwest Regional Conference of the National Organization for Changing Men (now the [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]]<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of NOMAS|url=http://www.nomas.org/history|publisher=National Organization for Men Against Sexism|access-date=July 5, 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090603053848/http://nomas.org/history| archive-date= June 3, 2009 | url-status= live|date=May 2012}}</ref>) titled "I Want a Twenty-Four Hour Truce During Which There Is No Rape."<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|pp=162–171}}</ref>

=== Relationship with John Stoltenberg ===
In 1974, Andrea and [[John Stoltenberg]] were introduced by a mutual friend, a theater director, at a meeting of the then-fledgling Gay Academic Union. Later in 1974, not attending together, they both  walked out of a poetry reading—a benefit for the [[War Resisters League]] in [[Greenwich Village]]—due to the misogynist content. It was then they began their decades-long intellectual and personal relationship. Moving in together, their agreement was that while they would always live together, they could have relationships outside of their partnership. They planned never to marry unless one of two things occurred.<ref name="Living">{{cite web |author=John Stoltenberg |author-link=John Stoltenberg |date=May–June 1994 |title=Living with Andrea Dworkin |url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/LivingWithAndrea.html |access-date=July 5, 2009 |work=Lambda Book Report}}</ref> As Andrea stated to the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 1985, "unless one of us is terminally ill or jailed for political activity.<nowiki>''</nowiki> About that piece, John said the "editor refused to allow the writer to identify us as gay and lesbian, as we had asked." They married in 1998 due to her ill health, specifically painful osteoarthritis. Their life of thirty-one years together ended in April 2005 with Dworkin's sudden death from heart disease, an enlarged heart. Since then, he has lived with his husband in Washington, DC.

In Martin Duberman’s biography, ''Andrea Dworkin: the Feminist as Revolutionary'', John is quoted describing the sexual dimension of their relationship.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Duberman |first=Martin |title=Andrea Dworkin: The Feminist as Revolutionary |publisher=The New Press |year=2020 |isbn=978-1620975855 |edition=1st |location=New York, New York |publication-date=8 September 2020 |pages=74-76, 106}}</ref> Andrea’s relationship with a woman, Joanne, was unwinding through the last half of the decade, and John maintained gay relationships with men throughout their time together.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Duberman |first=Martin |title=Andrea Dworkin: the Feminist as Revolutionary |publisher=New Press |year=2020 |isbn=9781620975855 |location=New York, NY |pages=74–76, 106 |language=English}}</ref>

Stoltenberg began writing a series of essays, books, and articles examining manhood and [[masculinity]] from a radical feminist perspective.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.feministcurrent.com/2013/09/09/john-stoltenberg-on-manhood-male-supremacy-and-men-as-feminist-allies/|title=John Stoltenberg on manhood, male supremacy, and men as feminist allies|last=Sporenda|date=September 9, 2013|website=Feminist Current}}</ref> Although Dworkin publicly wrote, "I love John with my heart and soul,"<ref>{{cite book |last=Dworkin |chapter=Andrea Dworkin |chapter-url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/AutobiographyIII.html |title=Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series, Vol. 21 |year=1994 |publisher=Thomson Gale |location=Farmington Hills, MI |isbn=978-0-8103-4518-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/contemporaryauth00joyc_2 }}</ref> and Stoltenberg described Dworkin as "the love of my life,"<ref name="Imagining">{{cite web|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/andreadworkin.html|title=Imagining Life Without Andrea|author=John Stoltenberg|date=April 30, 2005|publisher=Feminist.com|access-date=October 18, 2018|author-link=John Stoltenberg}}</ref> she continued to publicly identify herself as lesbian, and he as gay. Stoltenberg, recounting the perplexity that their relationship seemed to cause people in the press, summarized the relationship by saying, "So I state only the simplest facts publicly: yes, Andrea and I live together and love each other and we are each other's life partner, and yes we are both [[Coming out|out]]."<ref name="Living" />

=== Later life ===
From 1974 through 1983, Dworkin wrote prolifically, producing four volumes developing her overall thesis about the practice, meaning, and function of patriarchal, misogynist violence. In 1977, she became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}&nbsp; The Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref> Between 1985 and 1997, she produced eight more books: three of them with Catharine A. MacKinnon either as co-author or editor and two collections of formerly unpublished essays and speeches. Her two final books came out in the first years of the 21st century, the latter being a memoir.

Dworkin was a strong opponent of President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] during the [[Lewinsky scandal|scandal]] centered on his behavior toward [[Monica Lewinsky]], whom she supported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestaranto.com/hypo.htm|title=Who's a Hypocrite – and Who Cares?|author=James Taranto|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=August 4, 1998|access-date=March 4, 2011}}</ref> She also expressed support for [[Paula Jones]] and [[Juanita Broaddrick]].<ref>Candice E. Jackson. ''[[Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine]]''. Torrance, Calif.: World Ahead Publishing. p. 240.</ref>

In June 2000, she published ''[[Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel, and Women's Liberation]]'', in which she compared the oppression of women to the persecution of Jews, discussed the sexual politics of Jewish identity and [[antisemitism]], and called for the establishment of a women's homeland as a response to the oppression of women.

In 2002, Dworkin published her autobiography, ''Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant''. She soon began to speak and write again, and in an interview with [[Julie Bindel]] in 2004 said, "I thought I was finished, but I feel a new vitality. I want to continue to help women."<ref name=WithoutCompromise/> She published three more articles in ''The Guardian'' and began work on a new book, ''Writing America: How Novelists Invented and Gendered a Nation'', on the role of novelists such as [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[William Faulkner]], and [[Eudora Welty]] in the development of American political and cultural identity, which was left unfinished when she died.<ref name=TimesObit/> Dworkin's outline and proposal for the book was made public on June 15, 2022.<ref name="dailykos.com">{{Cite web |title="Writing America: How Novelists Invented & Gendered a Nation" By Andrea Dworkin |url=https://www.dailykos.com/story/2022/6/15/2103847/--Writing-America-How-Novelists-Invented-and-Gendered-a-Nation-By-Andrea-Dworkin |access-date=2022-06-16 |website=Daily Kos}}</ref>

=== Illness and death ===
During her final years, Dworkin suffered fragile health, and she revealed in her last column for ''The Guardian'' that she had been weakened and nearly crippled for the past several years by her weight and severe [[osteoarthritis]] in the knees.<ref name=ThroughPain>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/23/features.weekend|title=Through the pain barrier|access-date=July 11, 2009|author=Dworkin|date=April 23, 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}</ref> Shortly after returning from Paris in 1999, she had been hospitalized with a high fever and [[blood clot]]s in her legs. A few months after being released from the hospital, she became increasingly unable to bend her knees, and underwent surgery to replace her knees with [[titanium]] and plastic [[prosthetic]]s. She wrote, "The doctor who knows me best says that osteoarthritis begins long before it cripples—in my case, possibly from homelessness, or sexual abuse, or beatings on my legs, or my weight. John, my partner, blames ''Scapegoat'', a study of Jewish identity and women's liberation that took me nine years to write; it is, he says, the book that stole my health. I blame the drug-rape that I experienced in 1999 in Paris."<ref name=ThroughPain/> When a newspaper interviewer asked her how she would like to be remembered, she said, "In a museum, when male supremacy is dead.

==Anti-pornography activism==
Dworkin was a speaker, writer, and activist in the feminist anti-pornography movement.<ref name=WithoutCompromise/><ref name=NeverHated/><ref name=GuardianObit/> In February 1976, she took a leading role in organizing public pickets of ''[[Snuff (film)|Snuff]]'' in New York City and, during the fall, joined [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Grace Paley]], [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Shere Hite]], [[Lois Gould]], [[Barbara Deming]], [[Karla Jay]], [[Letty Cottin Pogrebin]], [[Robin Morgan]], and [[Susan Brownmiller]] in attempts to form a radical feminist antipornography group.<ref>{{cite book|author=Susan Brownmiller|author-link=Susan Brownmiller|title=In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Dial Press|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-385-31486-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/inourtimememoiro00brow_0/page/297 297–299]|url=https://archive.org/details/inourtimememoiro00brow_0/page/297}}</ref> Members of this group would go on to found [[Women Against Pornography]] in 1979, but by then Dworkin had begun to distance herself from the group over differences in approach.<ref>Brownmiller, ''In Our Time'', pp. 303, 316.</ref> She spoke at a [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] march in November 1978, joining 3,000 women in a march through the [[red-light district]] of San Francisco.<ref>Brownmiller, ''In Our Time'', pp. 391–392.</ref>

In 1981, Dworkin published ''[[Pornography: Men Possessing Women]]'', which analyzes contemporary and historical pornography as an industry of [[misogyny|misogynistic]] dehumanization. She argues that pornography is implicated in violence against women, both in its production (through the abuse of the women used to star in it), and in the social consequences of its consumption by encouraging men to eroticize the domination, humiliation, and abuse of women.<ref name=WithoutCompromise/><ref name=NeverHated/><ref name=GuardianObit/> Dworkin, who joined ''The American Heritage Dictionary''{{'s}} Usage Panel, also argued in ''Pornography'' that this denigration of women is [[feminist language reform|built into linguistic norms]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]|edition=3d|date=1992|isbn=0-395-44895-6|page=xii}}</ref>

=== Anti-pornography Civil Rights Ordinance ===
{{main|Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance}}
In 1980, [[Linda Boreman]] (who had appeared in the pornographic film ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' as "Linda Lovelace") made public statements that her ex-husband [[Chuck Traynor]] had beaten and raped her, and violently [[coercion|coerced]] her into making that and other pornographic films. Boreman made her charges public for the press corps at a press conference, with Dworkin, feminist lawyer [[Catharine MacKinnon]], and members of [[Women Against Pornography]]. After the press conference, Dworkin, MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, and Boreman began discussing the possibility of using federal [[civil rights]] law to seek damages from Traynor and the makers of ''Deep Throat''. Boreman was interested, but backed off after Steinem discovered that the [[statute of limitations]] for a possible suit had passed.<ref>Brownmiller, ''In Our Time'', p. 337.</ref>

Dworkin and MacKinnon, however, continued to discuss civil rights litigation as a possible approach to combating pornography. In the fall of 1983, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the [[University of Minnesota]], to teach a course in literature for the [[Women's Studies]] program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on pornography, where they hashed out details of a civil rights approach. With encouragement from community activists in south [[Minneapolis]], the Minneapolis city government hired Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft an antipornography civil rights ordinance as an amendment to the Minneapolis city civil rights ordinance.

The amendment defined pornography as a civil rights violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from pornography to sue the producers and distributors in [[Civil law (common law)|civil court]] for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council, but vetoed both times by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered the wording of the ordinance to be too vague.<ref>{{cite book |author=Donald Alexander Downs |title=The New Politics of Pornography |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1989 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newpoliticsofpor0000down/page/34 34–65] |isbn=978-0-226-16162-4 |chapter=The Minneapolis Ordinance and the Feminist Theory of Pornography and Sexuality |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4h4rpVBqtMgC&pg=PA34 |url=https://archive.org/details/newpoliticsofpor0000down/page/34 }}</ref> Another version of the ordinance passed in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, in 1984, but was overturned as [[United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] in the case ''[[American Booksellers v.

Dworkin continued to support the civil rights approach in her writing and activism, and supported anti-pornography feminists who organized later campaigns in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] (1985),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/OrdinanceMassComplete.html|title=Model Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance|last1=Dworkin|first1=Andrea|last2=MacKinnon|first2=Catharine A.

On January 22, 1986, Dworkin testified for half an hour before the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]'s [[Meese Report|Commission on Pornography]] (also known as the "Meese Commission") in New York City, and answered questions from commissioners after completing her testimony.<ref>Dworkin's testimony is reprinted as: {{citation| last = Dworkin | first = Andrea | author-link = Andrea Dworkin | contribution = Pornography is a civil rights issue: 1986 | editor-last = Dworkin | editor-first = Andrea | editor-link = Andrea Dworkin | title = Letters from a War Zone: Writings, 1976–1989 | pages = 276–307 | publisher = E.P.

In her testimony and replies to questions from the commissioners, Dworkin denounced the use of criminal obscenity prosecutions against pornographers, stating, "We are against obscenity laws. We do not want them. I want you to understand why, whether you end up agreeing or not."<ref name=WarZone285>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|p=285}}</ref> She argued that obscenity laws were largely ineffectual,<ref name=WarZone285/> that when they were effectual they only suppressed pornography from public view while allowing it to flourish out of sight,<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|pp=285–286}}</ref> and that they suppressed the wrong material, or the right material for the wrong reasons, arguing that "Obscenity laws are also woman-hating in their very construction. Their basic presumption is that it's women's bodies that are dirty."<ref name=WarZone286>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|p=286}}</ref>

Instead she offered five recommendations for the Commission, recommending (1) that "the Justice Department instruct law-enforcement agencies to keep records of the use of pornography in violent crimes",<ref name=WarZone286/> (2) a ban on the possession and distribution of pornography in prisons,<ref name=WarZone287>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|p=287}}</ref> (3) that prosecutors "enforce laws against pimping and pandering against pornographers",<ref name=WarZone287/> (4) that the administration "make it a Justice Department priority to enforce RICO (the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]]) against the pornography industry",<ref name=WarZone287/> and (5) that Congress adopt federal anti-pornography civil rights legislation which would provide for civil damages for harm inflicted on women. She suggested that the Commission consider "creating a criminal conspiracy provision under the civil rights law, such that conspiring to deprive a person of their civil rights by coercing them into pornography is a crime, and that conspiring to traffic in pornography is conspiring to deprive women of our civil rights."<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|p=288}}</ref> Dworkin compared her proposal to the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]'s use of civil rights litigation against the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref name=WarZone285/>

Dworkin also submitted into evidence a copy of Boreman's book ''Ordeal'', as an example of the abuses that she hoped to remedy, saying "The only thing atypical about Linda is that she has had the courage to make a public fight against what has happened to her. And whatever you come up with, it has to help her or it's not going to help anyone." Boreman had testified in person before the Commission, but the Commissioners had not yet seen her book.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|p=289}}</ref>

====Addendum: ''Butler'' decision in Canada   ====
In 1992, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] made a ruling in ''[[R.&nbsp;v. Butler]]'' which incorporated some elements of Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal work on pornography into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In ''Butler'', the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law could be enforced constitutionally against some pornography on the basis of the Charter's guarantees of sex equality.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brenda Cossman|title=Bad Attitude/s on Trial: Pornography, Feminism, and the ''Butler'' Decision|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8020-7643-4|location=Toronto|page=107|chapter=Feminist Fashion or Morality in Drag?

== Non-fiction (selected works) ==
=== ''Woman Hating'' ===
{{Main|Woman Hating}}
Published in 1974, ''Woman Hating: A Radical Look at Sexuality'' was Dworkin's first book outlining many foundational points comprising her developing feminist philosophy. She identifies the book as a revolutionary act, an expression of a "commitment to ending male dominance" in all its cultural and social manifestations.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1974|p=17}}</ref> 

The last section explores [[androgyny]] in myths and religions across the globe to "discern another ontology, one which discards the fiction that there are two polar distinct sexes." She was not alone in this endeavor. Dworkin's exploration exists in a Western literary lineage that includes ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'', by [[Virginia Woolf]], and ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'', by [[Marge Piercy]]. In the final chapter, she examines sexual similarities, hermaphroditism, parthenogenesis, pansexuality, homosexuality, transsexuality, transvestism, bestiality, incest, the family, and children. About this chapter she reflects on her own theorizing as problematic, existing outside of girls' and women's lived experience: "I think there are a lot of things really wrong with the last chapter of ''Woman Hating''", said Dworkin in an interview with Cindy Jenefsky for her book, ''Without Apology: Andrea Dworkin's Art and Politics''. She identifies factors which influenced the chapter: 'years of reading Freud and trying to figure out abstractly what all this was about'... [A]t the time ''Woman Hating'' was written, [there were] roots in the counterculture and the sexual liberation movement."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jenefsky|first=Cindy|title=Without Apology: Andrea Dworkin's Art and Politics|publisher=Westview Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0813318264|location=Boulder, CO|pages=139}}</ref>

Dworkin's work from the early 1980s onward contained frequent condemnations of incest and [[pedophilia]] as one of the chief forms of violence against women, arguing once that "incest is a crime committed against someone, a crime from which many victims never recover."<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|pp=139–142, 149, 176–180, 308, 314–315}}; Dworkin, ''Intercourse'', pp. 171, 194; {{harvnb|Dworkin|1997|pp=22–23, 79–80, 86, 123, 143, 173, 188–189}}</ref> In the early 1980s, she had a public row with her formerly admired friend [[Allen Ginsberg]], with whom she shared godparent status of a mutual friend's child. The intense disagreement was over his support for [[child pornography]] and pedophilia, in which Ginsberg said, "The [[Right-wing politics|right]] wants to put me in jail." Dworkin responded, "Yes, they're very sentimental; I'd kill you."<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|2002|pp=36–39, The Fight}}</ref>

=== ''Right-Wing Women'' ===
In 1983, Dworkin published ''Right-Wing Women: The Politics of Domesticated Females'', an examination of women's reasons for collaborating with conservative men for the limitation of women's freedom.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dworkin|title=Right Wing Women|year=1983|chapter=Abortion|access-date=July 8, 2009|chapter-url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/RightWingWomenAbortion.html}}</ref>

In the preface to the British edition,<ref>Reprinted in {{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|pp=185–194}}</ref> Dworkin stated that the [[New Right]] in the United States focused especially on preserving male authority in the family, the promotion of [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] versions of orthodox religion, combating abortion, and undermining efforts to combat domestic violence,<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|pp=192–193}}</ref> but that it also had, for the first time, "succeeded in getting ''women as women'' (women who claim to be acting in the interests of women as a group) to act effectively on behalf of male authority over women, on behalf of a hierarchy in which women are subservient to men, on behalf of women as the rightful property of men, on behalf of religion as an expression of transcendent male supremacy."<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|p=193}}</ref> Taking this as her problem, Dworkin asked, "Why do right-wing women agitate for their own subordination? How does the [[right-wing|Right]], controlled by men, enlist their participation and loyalty? And why do right-wing women truly hate the feminist struggle for equality?"<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|p=194}}</ref>

In one review, it was described as being premised on agreement between feminists and right-wing women on the existence of domination by men in sex and class, but disagreement on strategy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=Sallie L.|date=January 1983|title="''Right-Wing Women: The Politics of Domesticated Females''", by Andrea Dworkin (Book Review)|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/7544468/right-wing-women-book|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205110019/http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/7544468/right-wing-women-book|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 5, 2016|journal=[[Library Journal]]|volume=108|issue=1|page=59}}</ref>

===''Intercourse''===
{{main|Intercourse (book)}}

In 1987, Dworkin published ''[[Intercourse (book)|Intercourse]]'', in which she extended her analysis from pornography to [[sexual intercourse]] itself, and argued that the sort of sexual subordination depicted in pornography was central to men's and women's experiences of heterosexual intercourse in a male supremacist society. In the book, she argues that all heterosexual sex in our [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society is coercive and degrading to women, and sexual penetration may by its very nature doom women to inferiority and submission, and "may be immune to reform".<ref name=UCCB>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://faculty.cbu.ca/sstewart/sexlove/dworkin.htm |chapter=Occupation/Collaboration |title=Intercourse |author=Dworkin |access-date=February 14, 2013 |title-link=Intercourse (book) |archive-date=August 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806080404/http://faculty.cbu.ca/sstewart/sexlove/dworkin.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Citing from both pornography and literature—including ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]'', ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', and ''[[Dracula]]''—Dworkin argued that depictions of intercourse in mainstream art and culture consistently emphasized heterosexual intercourse as the only kind of "real" sex, portrayed intercourse in violent or invasive terms, portrayed the violence or invasiveness as central to its eroticism, and often united it with male contempt for, revulsion towards, or even murder of, the "carnal" woman. She argued that this kind of depiction enforced a male-centric and coercive view of sexuality, and that, when the cultural attitudes combine with the material conditions of women's lives in a [[sexist]] society, the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's subordination of women, experienced as a form of "occupation" that is nevertheless expected to be pleasurable for women and to define their very status ''as women''.<ref name="UCCB"/>

Such descriptions are often cited by Dworkin's critics, interpreting the book as claiming "all" heterosexual intercourse is rape, or more generally that the anatomical mechanics of sexual intercourse make it intrinsically harmful to women's equality. For instance, [[Cathy Young]] says that statements such as "intercourse is the pure, sterile, formal expression of men's contempt for women" are reasonably summarized as "all sex is rape".<ref name=YoungObit>{{cite news|url=http://reason.com/archives/2005/04/19/womans-hating|title= Woman's Hating: The Misdirected Passion of Andrea Dworkin|author=Cathy Young|newspaper= Reason.com|date= April 19, 2005|author-link= Cathy Young}}</ref>

Dworkin rejected that interpretation of her argument,<ref name=LieDetector>{{cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/LieDetect.html|title=The Andrea Dworkin Lie Detector|author=Nikki Craft|publisher=Andrea Dworkin Online Library|access-date=July 8, 2009|author-link=Nikki Craft}}</ref> stating in a later interview that "I think both intercourse and sexual pleasure can and will survive equality" and suggesting that the misunderstanding came about because of the very sexual ideology she was criticizing: "Since the paradigm for sex has been one of conquest, possession, and violation, I think many men believe they need an unfair advantage, which at its extreme would be called rape. I do not think they need it."<ref name=Moorcock>{{cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/MoorcockInterview.html|title=Fighting Talk|author=Michael Moorcock|work=[[New Statesman]] and Society|date=April 21, 1995|access-date=July 8, 2009|author-link=Michael Moorcock}}</ref>

=== ''Life and Death'' ===
In 1997, Dworkin published a collection of her speeches and articles from the 1990s in ''Life and Death: Unapologetic Writings on the Continuing War on Women'', including a long autobiographical essay on her life as a writer, and articles on violence against women, pornography, prostitution, [[Nicole Brown Simpson]], the use of rape during the [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[École Polytechnique massacre|Montreal massacre]], Israel, and the gender politics of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]].<ref name=TimesObit>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article380289.ece|title=Obituary|work=[[The Times]]|date=April 13, 2005|access-date=July 18, 2009|location=London}}{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Reviewing ''Life and Death'' in ''[[The New Republic]]'', philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] criticizes voices in contemporary feminism for denouncing [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and Dworkin as "man-haters", and argues that [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] critiques of Dworkin's civil ordinance proposal against pornography "are not saying anything intellectually respectable", for the First Amendment "has never covered all speech: bribery, threats, extortionate offers, misleading advertising, perjury, and unlicensed medical advice are all unprotected." Nussbaum adds that Dworkin has focused attention on the proper moral target by making harm associated with subordination, not obscenity, civilly actionable. Nevertheless, Nussbaum opposes the adoption of Dworkin's pornography ordinance because it (1) fails to distinguish between moral and legal violations, (2) fails to demonstrate a causal relationship between pornography and specific harm, (3) holds a creator of printed images or words responsible for others' behavior, (4) grants censorial power to the judiciary (which may be directed against feminist scholarship), and (5) erases the contextual considerations within which sex takes place. More broadly, Nussbaum faults Dworkin for (1) occluding economic injustice through an "obsessive focus on sexual subordination", (2) reproducing [[objectification]] in reducing her interlocutors to their abuse, and (3) refusing reconciliation in favor of "violent extralegal resistance against male violence."<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. "Rage and Reason." ''The New Republic.'' August 11, 1997, pp. 36–42.</ref>

Many of Dworkin's early speeches are reprinted in her second book, ''Our Blood'' (1976). Later selections of speeches were reprinted ten and twenty years later, in ''Letters from a War Zone'' (1988) and ''Life and Death'' (1997).<ref name="TimesObit2">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article380289.ece|title=Obituary|date=April 13, 2005|work=[[The Times]]|access-date=July 18, 2009|location=London}}{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

== Fiction ==
Dworkin published three fictional works after achieving notice as a feminist author and activist. She published a collection of short stories, ''the new womans broken heart'' in 1980. Her first novel, ''Ice and Fire'', was originally published in the United Kingdom in 1986. It is a [[first-person narrative]], detailing violence and abuse; [[Susie Bright]] has claimed that it amounts to a modern feminist rewriting of one of the [[Marquis de Sade]]'s most famous works, ''[[L'Histoire de Juliette|Juliette]]''.<ref name="BrightObit">{{cite web|url=http://susiebright.blogs.com/susie_brights_journal_/2005/04/andrea_dworkin_.html|title=Andrea Dworkin Has Died|author=Susie Bright|author-link=Susie Bright|date=April 11, 2005|access-date=July 11, 2009}}</ref> However, Dworkin aimed to depict men's harm to women as normalized political harm, not as eccentric eroticism. Dworkin's second novel, ''Mercy'', reviewed by the ''New York Times'' as a [[Bildungsroman]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/15/books/declaring-war-on-men.html|title=Declaring War on Men|last=Steiner|first=Wendy|date=September 15, 1991|website=New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525230014/https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/15/books/declaring-war-on-men.html|archive-date=May 25, 2015}}</ref> was first published in the United Kingdom in 1990. According to ''The Telegraph'', the novels "were not popular".<ref name="obit-Telegraph">[https://web.archive.org/web/20121114001012/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/1487683/Andrea-Dworkin.html ''Andrea Dworkin'', in ''The Telegraph'', April 13, 2005, (section "News", subsection "Obits", subsubsection "Culture")], as accessed February 15, 2013 (obituary).</ref>

Dworkin's short fiction and novels often incorporated elements from her life and themes from her nonfiction writing, sometimes related by a first-person narrator. Critics have sometimes quoted passages spoken by characters in ''Ice and Fire'' as representations of Dworkin's own views.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatherhoodcoalition.org/cpf/newreadings/2001/feminist_hate_speech.htm|title=Feminist Hate-Speech|author=Gladden Schrock|publisher=The Fatherhood Coalition|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527153653/http://www.fatherhoodcoalition.org/cpf/newreadings/2001/feminist_hate_speech.htm|archive-date=May 27, 2009|access-date=July 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/r/ross-eric/2005/ross072205.htm|title=Mind-Programming of the Masses|author=Eric Ross|date=November 21, 2017|work=MacDworkinism and VAWA: The Fraud of the Millennia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508232955/http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/r/ross-eric/2005/ross072205.htm|archive-date=May 8, 2008|access-date=July 11, 2009}}</ref><ref name="LieDetector" /> Dworkin, however, wrote "My fiction is not autobiography. I am not an exhibitionist. I do not show myself. I am not asking for forgiveness. I do not want to confess. But I have used everything I know—my life—to show what I believe must be shown so that it can be faced. The imperative at the heart of my writing—what must be done—comes directly from my life. But I do not show my life directly, in full view; nor even look at it while others watch."<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1997|p=15}}</ref>

== Influence ==
Dworkin's writings were designed to assert the ubiquity and denounce the injustice of institutionalized and normalized sex-based harm against women. She became one of the most influential writers and spokeswomen of American [[radical feminism]] during the late 1970s and the 1980s.<ref name=NeverHated/><ref name=Trouble/> She characterized pornography as an industry of damaging objectification and abuse, not a metaphysical fantasy realm. She discussed prostitution as a system of exploitation, and intercourse as a key site of intimate subordination in [[patriarchy]]. Her analysis and writing influenced and inspired the work of contemporary feminists such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Jeffries|first=Stuart|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety|title=Are women human?|date=April 12, 2006|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=July 18, 2009|location=London| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090826173650/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety| archive-date= August 26, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Gloria Steinem,<ref>{{cite news|last=Heller|first=Zoe|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705215011/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-new-eve-these-are-some-common-perceptions-about-andrea-dworkin-that-she-hates-men-that-she-hates-sex-and-has-no-real-understanding-of-either-wrong-on-three-counts-her-crusade-against-pornography-and-the-brutalisation-of-women-derives-much-of-its-emotional-power-from-a-fund-of-bitter-personal-experience-1561920.html|archive-date=July 5, 2015|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-new-eve-these-are-some-common-perceptions-about-andrea-dworkin-that-she-hates-men-that-she-hates-sex-and-has-no-real-understanding-of-either-wrong-on-three-counts-her-crusade-against-pornography-and-the-brutalisation-of-women-derives-much-of-its-emotional-power-from-a-fund-of-bitter-personal-experience-1561920.html|title=The New Eve|date=December 6, 1992|work=[[The Independent|Independent on Sunday]]|access-date=July 18, 2009|url-status=dead|location=London}}</ref> [[John Stoltenberg]],<ref name=PrisonerofSex/> [[Nikki Craft]],<ref>{{cite web|last =Craft|first =Nikki |author-link =Nikki Craft|url=http://www.nikkicraft.com/|title=The Nikki Wiki: All About Nikki Craft|website=nikkicraft.com|access-date=July 18, 2009}}</ref> [[Susan G.

Further critics, especially women who identify as feminists{{Who|date=August 2024}} but sharply differ with Dworkin's positions and strategies, have suggested that Dworkin called attention to real and important problems, but that her legacy as a whole had been destructive to the women's movement.<ref>{{cite news|last = Marking | first = Havana |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/15/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety |title=The Real Legacy of Andrea Dworkin |date=April 15, 2005|access-date=July 12, 2009 | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]]| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090826060751/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/15/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety| archive-date= August 26, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Her work and activism on pornography—especially in the form of the [[Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance]]—were criticized by liberal groups such as the Feminist Anti-Censorship Task Force (FACT).<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1395106|title = Who Watches the Watchwomen?: Feminists against Censorship|journal = Feminist Review|volume = 36|issue = 36|pages = 19–24|last1 = Rodgerson|first1 = Gillian|last2 = Semple|first2 = Linda|year = 1990|doi = 10.1057/fr.1990.42|s2cid = 144019251}}</ref>

Dworkin was also met with criticism from [[sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminists]], in what became known as the [[feminist sex wars]] of the late 1970s and 1980s. The sex wars were a series of heated debates that polarized feminist thought on a number of issues relating to sex and sexuality. Sex-positive feminist critics criticized Dworkin's legal activism as censorious, and argued that her work on pornography and sexuality promoted an essentialist, conservative, or repressive view of sexuality, which they often characterized as "anti-sex" or "sex-negative". Her criticisms of common heterosexual sexual expression, pornography, prostitution, and [[sadomasochism]] were frequently claimed to disregard women's own agency in sex or deny women's sexual choices. Dworkin countered that her critics often misrepresented her views,<ref>See, for example, {{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|p=110}}: "One of the slurs constantly used against me by women writing in behalf of pornography under the flag of feminism in misogynist media is that I endorse a primitive biological determinism. ''Woman Hating'' clearly repudiates any biological determinism; so does ''Our Blood'' (1976), especially "The Root Cause." So does this piece, published twice, in 1978 in ''Heresies'' and in 1979 in ''Broadsheet''. The event described in this piece ["Biological Superiority: The World's Most Dangerous and Deadly Idea"], which occurred in 1977, was fairly notorious, and so my position on biological determinism—I am against it—is generally known in the Women's Movement."</ref> and that under the heading of "choice" and "sex-positivity", her feminist critics were failing to question the often violent political structures that confined women's choices and shaped the meaning of sex acts.<ref>See, for example, the 1995 Preface to ''Intercourse'', pp. vii–x, and ''Intercourse'', Chapter 7.</ref>

However, in the 21st century, Dworkin has garnered favor with younger generations of feminists, Lauren Oyler (b. 1991), [[Shitty Media Men|Moira Donegan]] (b. 1989), [[Jennifer Szalai]] (b. 1979-80), [[Michelle Goldberg]] (b. 1975), and [[Johanna Fateman|Joanna Fateman]] (b. 1974), who found liberal and sex-positive feminism lacking in depth of analysis and action.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=April 21 |last2=Pazner |first2=2021 Lily |title=Lessons From Andrea Dworkin: On Creating the Feminist Movement We Need |url=https://jwa.org/blog/risingvoices/lessons-andrea-dworkin-creating-feminist-movement-we-need |access-date=2022-05-15 |website=Jewish Women's Archive |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Oyler |first=Lauren |date=2019-03-23 |title=The Radical Style of Andrea Dworkin |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/01/the-radical-style-of-andrea-dworkin |access-date=2022-05-15 |magazine=The New Yorker |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Donegan |first=Moira |date=Feb–Mar 2019 |title=Sex During Wartime: The return of Andrea Dworkin's radical vision |url=https://www.bookforum.com/print/2505/the-return-of-andrea-dworkin-s-radical-vision-20623 |access-date=2022-05-15 |website=www.bookforum.com |language=en-US |archive-date=March 9, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230309094033/https://www.bookforum.com/print/2505/the-return-of-andrea-dworkin-s-radical-vision-20623 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Szalai |first=Jennifer |date=2019-03-12 |title=Andrea Dworkin, a Startling and Ruthless Feminist Whose Work Is Back in the Spotlight |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/books/review-last-days-at-hot-slit-andrea-dworkin.html |access-date=2022-05-15 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Michelle |date=2019-02-22 |title=Opinion {{!}} Not the Fun Kind of Feminist |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/opinion/sunday/trump-feminism-andrea-dworkin.html |access-date=2022-05-15 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Fateman |first=Johanna |date=15 February 2019 |title=The Power of Andrea Dworkin's Rage |url=https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/02/15/the-power-of-andrea-dworkins-rage/ |access-date=2022-05-15 |website=The New York Review of Books |language=en}}</ref>

In 1989, Dworkin wrote an article about her life as a battered wife in the Netherlands, "What Battery Really Is", in response to Susan Brownmiller, who had argued that [[Hedda Nussbaum]], a battered woman, should have been indicted for her failure to stop [[Joel Steinberg]] from murdering their adoptive daughter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneAfterword.html|title=What Battery Really Is|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|date=1989b|website=No Status Quo}}</ref> ''[[Newsweek]]'' initially accepted "What Battery Really Is" for publication, but then declined to publish the account at the request of their attorney, according to Dworkin, arguing that she needed either to publish anonymously "to protect the identity of the batterer" and remove references to specific injuries, or to provide "medical records, police records, a written statement from a doctor who had seen the injuries". Instead, Dworkin submitted the article to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', which published it on March 12, 1989.<ref>{{harvnb|Dworkin|1989a|p=330}}</ref>
