'''Sextus Empiricus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Σέξτος Ἐμπειρικός}}, {{transliteration|grc|Sextos Empeirikos}}; {{Floruit|mid-late 2nd century AD}}) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] [[philosopher]] and [[Empiric school]] [[physician]] with [[Roman citizenship]]. His philosophical works are the most complete surviving account of ancient Greek and Roman [[Pyrrhonism]], and because of the arguments they contain against the other [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]], they are also a major source of information about those philosophies.

== Life ==
Little is known about Sextus Empiricus. He likely lived in [[Alexandria]], [[Rome]], or [[Athens]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL273/1933/volume.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230608153204/https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674993013 |title=Outlines of Pyrrhonism |website=[[Loeb Classical Library]] |access-date=2023-10-15 | archive-date=2023-06-08 |url-status=live}}</ref> His Roman name, [[Sextus]], implies he was a Roman citizen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPFkU8agamYC&dq=sextus+empiricus+roman+citizen&pg=PA6|title=What Did the Romans Know?: An Inquiry into Science and Worldmaking|first=Daryn|last=Lehoux|date=March 15, 2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> The ''[[Suda]],'' a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, states that he was the same person as [[Sextus of Chaeronea]],<ref name="auto">[[Suda]], Sextos σ 235.</ref> as do other pre-modern sources, but this identification is commonly doubted.<ref>[[Luciano Floridi]] ''Sextus Empiricus: The Transmission and Recovery of Pyrrhonism'' 2002 {{ISBN|0195146719}} pp 3–7.</ref> In his medical work, as reflected by his name, tradition maintains that he belonged to the Empiric school in which Pyrrhonism was popular. However, at least twice in his writings, Sextus seems to place himself closer to the [[Methodic school]].

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Pyrrhonism}}
As a skeptic, Sextus Empiricus raised concerns which applied to all types of knowledge. He doubted the validity of [[problem of induction|induction]]<ref>Sextus Empiricus. ''[[Outlines of Pyrrhonism]]'' trans. [[Robert Gregg Bury|R.G. Bury]] (Loeb edn) (London: W. Heinemann, 1933), p. 283.</ref> long before its best known critic [[David Hume]], and raised the [[regress argument]] against all forms of reasoning:
{{blockquote|Those who claim for themselves to judge the truth are bound to possess a criterion of truth. This criterion, then, either is without a judge's approval or has been approved. But if it is without approval, whence comes it that it is trustworthy? For no matter of dispute is to be trusted without judging. And, if it has been approved, that which approves it, in turn, either has been approved or has not been approved, and so on ''[[ad infinitum]]''.<ref>Sextus Empiricus. ''Against the Logicians'' trans. R.G. Bury (Loeb edn) (London: W. Heinemann, 1935) p. 179</ref>}}
This view is known as [[Pyrrhonian skepticism]], which Sextus differentiated from [[Academic skepticism]] as practiced by [[Carneades]] which, according to Sextus, denies the possibility of knowledge altogether, something that Sextus criticized as being an affirmative belief. Instead, Sextus advocates simply giving up belief; in other words, suspending judgment ([[epoché]]) about whether or not anything is knowable.<ref>See ''PH'' I.3, I.8, I.198; cf. J. Barnes, "Introduction", xix ff., in Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Scepticism''. Julia Annas and Jonathan Barnes (transl.) (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000).</ref> Only by suspending judgment can we attain a state of [[ataraxia]] (roughly, 'peace of mind').

There is some debate as to the extent to which Sextus advocated the suspension of judgement. According to [[Myles Burnyeat]],<ref>Burnyeat, M., "Can The Sceptic Live His Scepticism" in Myles Burnyeat and Michael Frede (ed.), ''The Original Sceptics: A Controversy'' (Hackett, 1997): 25–57. Cf. Burnyeat, M., "The Sceptic in His Place and Time", ''ibid.'', 92–126.</ref>  [[Jonathan Barnes]],<ref>Barnes, J., "The Beliefs of a Pyrrhonist" in Myles Burnyeat and Michael Frede (ed.), ''The Original Sceptics: A Controversy'' (Hackett, 1997): 58–91.</ref> and [[Benson Mates]],<ref>Mates, B. ''The Skeptic Way'' (Oxford UP, 1996).</ref> Sextus advises that we should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs; that is to say, we should neither affirm any belief as true nor deny any belief as false, since we may live without any beliefs, acting by habit. [[Michael Frede]], however, defends a different interpretation,<ref>Frede, M., "The Sceptic's Beliefs" in Myles Burnyeat and Michael Frede (ed.), ''The Original Sceptics: A Controversy'' (Hackett, 1997): 1–24. Cf. Frede, M., "The Skeptic's Two Kinds of Assent and the Question of the Possibility of Knowledge", ''ibid.'', 127–152.</ref> according to which Sextus does allow beliefs, so long as they are not derived by reason, philosophy or speculation; a skeptic may, for example, accept common opinions in the skeptic's society. The important difference between the skeptic and the dogmatist is that the skeptic does not hold his beliefs ''as a result of rigorous philosophical investigation.''

[[Diogenes Laërtius]]<ref>[[Diogenes Laërtius]] '' Lives of Eminent Philosophers'' "Life of Timon" Book IX Chapter 12 Section 116 [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D12]</ref> and the [[Suda]]<ref name="auto"/> report that Sextus Empiricus wrote ten books on Pyrrhonism. The Suda also says Sextus wrote a book ''Ethica''. Sextus Empiricus's three surviving works are the ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' ({{Lang|grc|Πυῤῥώνειοι ὑποτυπώσεις}}, ''Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis'', thus commonly abbreviated ''PH''), and two distinct works preserved under the same title, ''Adversus Mathematicos'' ({{lang|grc|Πρὸς μαθηματικούς}}, ''Pros mathematikous'', commonly abbreviated "AM" or "M" and known as ''Against Those in the Disciplines,'' or ''Against the Mathematicians''). ''Adversus Mathematicos'' is incomplete as the text references parts that are not in the surviving text. ''Adversus Mathematicos'' also includes mentions of three other works which did not survive: 
* ''Medical Commentaries'' (AD I 202) 
* ''Empirical Commentaries'' (AM I 62)
* ''Commentaries on the Soul'' which includes a discussion of the Pythagoreans' metaphysical theory of numbers (AD IV 284) and shows that the soul is nothing (AM VI 55)<ref>Machuca, Diego ''Sextus Empiricus : his outlook, works, and legacy'' 2008 p. 35 [https://philarchive.org/archive/MACSEH]</ref>

The surviving first six books of ''Adversus Mathematicos'' are commonly known as ''Against the Professors''. Each book also has a traditional title;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sextus-empiricus/|title=Sextus Empiricus|author=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=29 May 2015}}</ref> although none of these titles except ''Pros mathematikous'' and ''Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis'' are found in the manuscripts.

''Adversus Mathematicos'' ''I–VI'' is sometimes distinguished from ''Adversus Mathematicos'' ''VII–XI'' by using another title, ''Against the Dogmatists'' ({{lang|grc|Πρὸς δογματικούς}}, ''Pros dogmatikous'') and then the remaining books are numbered as I–II, III–IV, and V, despite the fact that it is commonly inferred that what we have is just part of a larger work whose beginning is missing and it is unknown how much of the total work has been lost.

== Legacy ==
An influential [[Latin]] translation of Sextus's ''Outlines'' was published by [[Henricus Stephanus]] in [[Geneva]] in 1562,<ref>Bican Şahin, [''Toleration: The Liberal Virtue''], Lexington Books, 2010, p. 18.</ref> and this was followed by a complete Latin Sextus with [[Gentian Hervet]] as translator in 1569.<ref>[[Richard Popkin]] (editor), ''History of Western Philosophy'' (1998) p. 330.</ref> Petrus and Jacobus Chouet published the Greek text for the first time in 1621. Stephanus did not publish it with his Latin translation either in 1562 or in 1569, nor was it published in the reprint of the latter in 1619.

Sextus's ''Outlines'' were widely read in [[Europe]] during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, and had a profound effect on [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[David Hume]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], among many others. Another source for the circulation of Sextus's ideas was [[Pierre Bayle]]'s ''Dictionary''. The legacy of Pyrrhonism is described in [[Richard Popkin]]'s ''The History of Skepticism from Erasmus to Descartes'' and ''High Road to Pyrrhonism''. The transmission of Sextus's manuscripts through antiquity and the Middle Ages is reconstructed by [[Luciano Floridi]]'s ''Sextus Empiricus, The Recovery and Transmission of Pyrrhonism'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2002). Since the Renaissance, French philosophy has been continuously influenced by Sextus: [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] in the 16th century, [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Pierre-Daniel Huet]] and [[François de La Mothe Le Vayer]] in the 17th century, many of the "Philosophes", and in recent times controversial figures such as [[Michel Onfray]], in a direct line of filiation between Sextus' radical skepticism and secular or even radical atheism.<ref>Recent Greek-French edition of Sextus's works by Pierre Pellegrin, with an upbeat commentary.
