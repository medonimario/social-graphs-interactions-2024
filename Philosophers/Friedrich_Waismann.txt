'''Friedrich Waismann''' ({{IPA|de|ˈvaɪsman|lang}}; 21 March 1896{{spaced ndash}}4 November 1959) was an [[Austria]]n [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], and [[philosopher]].  He is best known for being a member of the [[Vienna Circle]] and one of the key theorists in [[logical positivism]].

==Biography==

Born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]], Waismann was educated in mathematics and physics at the [[University of Vienna]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Quinton |first=Anthony |author-link=Anthony Quinton |url=https://archive.org/details/philosophicalpap0008wais |title=Friedrich Waismann: Philosophical Papers |date=1977 |publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company |isbn=9789027707130 |editor1-last=McGuiness |editor1-first=Brian |editor-link=Brian McGuinness |page=ix |chapter=Introduction |url-access=registration}}</ref> In 1922, he began to study philosophy under the tutelage of [[Moritz Schlick]], the founder of the Vienna Circle. He emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1938 due to the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] by [[Nazi Germany]].

He was a reader in [[philosophy of science]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1937 to 1939, and lecturer in [[philosophy of mathematics]] at the [[University of Oxford]] from 1939 until his death. He died in [[Oxford]].

==Relationship with Wittgenstein==
Intermittently, from 1927 until 1936, Waismann had extensive conversations with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] about topics in philosophy of mathematics and [[philosophy of language]]. These conversations, recorded by Waismann, were published in ''Ludwig Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle'' (1979, ed. B.F. McGuinness). Other members of the Circle (including Schlick, [[Rudolf Carnap]], and [[Herbert Feigl]]) also spoke with Wittgenstein, but not to the extent Waismann did.

At one point in 1934, Wittgenstein and Waismann considered collaborating on a book, but these plans fell through after their philosophical differences became apparent.

Waismann later accused Wittgenstein of [[obscurantism]] because of what he considered to be his betrayal of the project of logical positivism and empirically-based explanation.<ref>Shanker, S., & Shanker, V. A. (1986), ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: critical assessments''. London: Croom Helm,50-51.</ref> Ultimately the texts for the project, written or just transcribed by Waismann, were published by [[Gordon Baker]] in 2003.<ref>''The Voices of Wittgenstein, the Vienna Circle'', by Ludwig Wittgenstein and Friedrich Waismann, Transcribed, edited and with an introduction by Gordon Baker, London:Routledge, 2003. On page xvii the editor asserts that "Like ''Ludwig Wittgenstein und der Wiener Kreis'', this book is the publication of an important part of Waismann’s [[Nachlass]], and authorship is therefore appropriately ascribed to Waismann."</ref>

==Linguistic philosophy and logical positivism==
In ''Introduction to Mathematical Thinking: The Formation of Concepts in Modern Mathematics'' (1936), Waismann argued that mathematical truths are true by convention rather than being necessarily (or verifiably) true. His collected lectures, ''The Principles of Linguistic Philosophy'' (1965), and ''How I See Philosophy'' (1968, ed. [[R. Harré]]), a collection of papers, were published posthumously.

==''Porosity'' and ''verifiability''==
Waismann introduced the concept of ''[[open texture]]'', or ''porosity'' to describe the  universal possibility of vagueness in empirical statements;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waismann|first=Frederick|date=1951|title=Verifiability|journal=Logic and Language|volume=1|pages=119–123|via=Blackwell}}</ref> it is based on Wittgenstein's ''Philosophical Investigations'', particularly Section 80.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law|last1=Tiersma|first1=Peter Meijes|last2=Tiersma|first2=Peter|last3=Solan|first3=Lawrence|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199572120|location=Oxford|pages=149}}</ref> According to the philosopher, even after measures have been taken to ensure that a statement is precise, there remains an inexhaustible source of vagueness due to an indefinite number of possibilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd Edition, Robert Audi, 1999: The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Second Edition|last=Audi|first=Robert|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521637220|location=Cambridge|pages=632}}</ref> Waismann's notion of ''vagueness'' is slightly different from his concept of ''open texture''―he explained that open texture is more like the possibility of vagueness;<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Law and Language: Current Legal Issues|last1=Freeman|first1=Michael|last2=Smith|first2=Fiona|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199673667|location=Oxford|pages=132}}</ref> vagueness can also be remedied so that it can be made more precise, while open texture cannot.<ref name=":0" />

Open texture has been found in legal philosophy through the writings of [[H. L. A. Hart]] (see Hart's "The Concept of Law about Rule Skepticism" and Waismann's article "Verifiability").<ref>{{Citation|last=Waismann|first=F.|chapter=Verifiability|date=1968|pages=39–66|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781349001040|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-00102-6_2|title=How I See Philosophy}}</ref> According to Hart, vagueness constitutes a fundamental feature of legal languages.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Legal Method and the Rule of Law|last=Urbina|first=Sebastián|date=2002-08-31|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9041118705|location=The Hague|pages=81}}</ref> It is claimed, however, that Waismann's conceptualization has limited practical application, since it is more for the ''extraordinary'', while Hart's view of open texture concerns the more ''mundane'', approaching the term in the context of a particular norm.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Logic of Legal Requirements: Essays on Defeasibility|last1=Beltrán|first1=Jordi Ferrer|last2=Ratti|first2=Giovanni Battista|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199661640|location=Oxford|pages=196}}</ref>
