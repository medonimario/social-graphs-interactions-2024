{{distinguish|text=[[Judah ben Isaac Messer Leon]] of Paris (1166–1224)}}

'''Judah ben Jehiel''', ({{langx|he|יהודה בן יחיאל}}, {{circa}} 1420 to 1425 – c. 1498), more usually called '''Judah Messer Leon''' ({{langx|he|יהודה מסר לאון}}), was an [[Italian Jews|Italian]] [[rabbi]], teacher, [[physician]], and [[philosopher]]. Through his works, assimilating and embodying the intellectual approach of the best Italian universities of the time, yet setting it inside the intellectual culture of Jewish tradition, he is seen as a quintessential example of a ''hakham kolel'' ("comprehensive scholar"), a scholar who excelled in both secular and rabbinic studies, the Hebrew equivalent of a [[polymath|Renaissance man]]. This was the ideal he tried to instil in his students. One of his students was [[Yohanan Alemanno]].

==Life==
Judah is thought to have been born in around 1420 at [[Montecchio Maggiore]], now in the Italian [[province of Vicenza]]. The son of a doctor, he was ordained as a rabbi and received a diploma in medicine while in his early 20s. According to tradition the honorific title ''Messer'' (a title of [[knight]]hood) was bestowed on him by the [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]], during the emperor's first visit to Italy in 1452, perhaps for work for him as a physician. The name "[[Leon (given name)|Leon]]" is the usual equivalent of "[[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]]", through the traditional identification of the [[lion of Judah]].

Messer Leon settled as a rabbi at [[Ancona]] at about this time, and established a ''[[yeshiva]]'', or academy, where he combined the traditional study of the Jewish texts with lectures on the non-Jewish program of the medieval secular curriculum. This academy was to follow him wherever he stayed around Italy over the next four decades. He was also licensed to practice medicine, and his successful activities in this field brought him much acclaim. Between 1456 and 1472 he lived in [[Padua]] and [[Bologna]], where he may have studied further at the famous Universities. He is said to have been awarded the title Doctor in Padua in 1469. After a short stay in [[Venice]], where his son [[David ben Judah Messer Leon|David]] was born, in 1473 he became rabbi in [[Mantua]]. There he fell into a conflict with his colleague [[Joseph Colon Trabotto]], in consequence of which both were expelled from the city in 1475.

In 1480 he settled in [[Naples]], then under the accommodating rule of [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand I]]. He remained there, with his academy, for virtually the whole of the rest of his life, until he and his son David were forced to flee in 1495, the year after the death of King Ferdinand, to escape the violent pogroms that ensued following the capture of the city by the French under [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]]. An ordination document issued by David in September 1499 refers to his father as by then already dead. Rabinowitz conjectures that Messer Leon had been with David, and died at Monastir (present-day [[Bitola]] in the [[Republic of Macedonia]]) in that year. However, Tirosh-Rothschild (p.&nbsp;253, n. 104) believes he was still in Naples, and died there in 1497.

==Works==
Messer Leon wrote extensively, including commentaries on the ''[[Organon]]'', the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', and the [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'' of Aristotle]], and their analysis by [[Averroes]], in which he followed the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] style and methods, composing for his students "summaries (''sefeqot'') on the Scholastic ''quaestiones'' (i.e. points of apparent textual contradiction) debated by the Italian academic community",<ref>Zonta p. 210, quoting Tirosh-Rothschild</ref> drawing closely on the style and substance of expositions then current at Padua.

These commentaries were written primarily for his close followers. More generally circulated were three textbooks addressing the three foundation subjects of a Renaissance secular education, the ''[[trivium]]'' ("three ways") of [[grammar]], [[logic]] and [[rhetoric]], seen as the essential prerequisite disciplines necessary for higher studies in the humanities, philosophy, and medicine. These subjects he covered with a Hebrew grammar under the title ''Libnat ha-Sappir'' (''The Pavement of Sapphire'') in 1454, a textbook on logic entitled ''Miklal Yofi'' (''Perfection of Beauty'') in 1455, and, most celebrated, a textbook of rhetoric called ''Nofet Zufim'' (''The Honeycomb's Flow''), which was printed by [[Abraham Conat]] of Mantua in 1475-6, the only work by a living author printed in Hebrew in the fifteenth century.

Like non-Jewish contemporary texts, the ''Nofet Zufim'' drew heavily on the classical theoretical writings of [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]]. But unlike its contemporaries, it took as its exemplars for such theories not the foremost orators of Greek and Roman antiquity, but [[Moses]] and the leading figures of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. In the opinion of Deutsch,<ref>Jewish Encyclopedia</ref> the object of the work was both [[apologetics|apologetic]] and [[propaganda|propagandic]]. The author desired to demonstrate to the non-Jewish world that the Jews were not devoid of the literary sense, and he wished to prove to his co-religionists that [[Judaism]] is not hostile to secular studies, which contribute to a better appreciation of Jewish literature. Although in later centuries the book was largely forgotten, and was not reprinted until the nineteenth century, in the intellectual circle of its own time it was highly appreciated. [[Azariah dei Rossi]] quoted Leon as a witness to the value of secular studies,<ref>ch. ii., in ''Me'or 'Enayim'', ed. Benjacob, i. 75, Wilna, 1863</ref> and [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]] recommended the book to the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] [[Zeraḥ bar Natan]] of [[Trakai]].<ref>Geiger, ''Melo Chofnajim'', p. 19, Berlin, 1840.</ref> In recent times interest has been renewed, with a new scholarly edition with translation and commentary published in 1983.

==Descendants==
{{main|David ben Judah Messer Leon}}
Following on from his father, Messer Leon's son also became a noted rabbi, physician and author, and defender of the value of the secular disciplines of the Renaissance to Jewish philosophy culture and study. David became best known for his ''Ein ha-Kore'' (''Eye of the Reader''), a sympathetic commentary on [[Maimonides]]' ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]''; and posthumously for his ''Tehillah le-Dawid'' (''Glory to David''), an encyclopedic summary of Jewish philosophy, edited by his grandson Aaron ben Judah (Constantinople, 1577).
