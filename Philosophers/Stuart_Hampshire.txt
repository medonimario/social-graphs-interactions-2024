'''Sir Stuart Newton Hampshire''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (1 October 1914 – 13 June 2004) was an English [[philosopher]], [[literary critic]] and university administrator.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=O'Grady |first=Jane |date=2004-06-16 |title=Sir Stuart Hampshire |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jun/16/guardianobituaries.obituaries |access-date=2024-07-04 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> He was one of the [[rationalism|antirationalist]] [[Oxford University|Oxford]] thinkers who gave a new direction to moral and political thought in the post-[[World War II]] era.

==Biography==
Hampshire was born in [[Healing, Lincolnshire]], the son of George Newton Hampshire, a fish merchant in nearby [[Grimsby]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite ODNB |id=94197 |title=Hampshire, Sir Stuart Newton |url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-94197 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210311003907/https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-94197 |archive-date=11 March 2021 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Hampshire was educated at [[Lockers Park School]] in Hertfordshire (where he overlapped with Guy Burgess),<ref>Stewart Purvia, Jeff Hulbert, ''Guy Burgess: The Spy Who Knew Everyone' (Biteback Publishing, 2016, {{ISBN|1849549133}}), p.6</ref> [[Repton School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he matriculated as a [[history]] scholar.<ref name=":0" /> He did not confine himself to history, switching instead to the study of [[literae humaniores|Greats]]<ref name=":1" /> and immersing himself in the study of [[painting]] and literature. As was the culture at Balliol, his intellectual development owed more to his gifted contemporaries than to academic tutors. Having taken a first class degree, in 1936 he was elected to a Fellowship of [[All Souls College, Oxford]],<ref name=":0" /> where he researched and taught [[philosophy]] initially as an adherent of [[logical positivism]]. He participated in an informal discussion group with some of the leading philosophers of his day, including [[J. L. Austin]], [[H. L. A. Hart]], and [[Isaiah Berlin]].<ref name=":1" />

In 1940, at the outbreak of [[World War II]] he enlisted in the [[army]] and was given a commission. Due to his lack of physical aptitude he was seconded to a position in [[military intelligence]] near [[London]] where he worked with Oxford colleagues such as [[Gilbert Ryle]] and [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]].<ref name=":1" /> His encounters as interrogator with [[Nazism|Nazi]] officers at the end of the war led to his insistence on the reality of [[evil]].<ref name=":0" />

After the war, he worked for the government before resuming his career in philosophy. From 1947 to 1950, he taught at [[University College London]], and was subsequently a fellow of [[New College, Oxford]].<ref name=":0" /> His study ''[[Spinoza (book)|Spinoza]]'' was first published in 1951.<ref name=":1" /> In 1955, he returned to [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]], as a resident fellow and domestic bursar.<ref name=":0" />

His innovative book ''[[Thought and Action]]'' (1959) attracted much attention, notably from his Oxford colleague [[Iris Murdoch]].<ref>See Iris Murdoch 'Existentialists and Mystics' (London, [[Chatto & Windus]] 1997)  A critique of Hampshire emerges most strongly in 'The Idea of Perfection', ''Yale Review'' Spring 1964</ref> It propounded an ''intentionalist'' theory of the [[philosophy of mind]] taking account of developments in [[psychology]]. Although he considered most [[continental philosophy]] vulgar and fraudulent, Hampshire was much influenced by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. He insisted that philosophy of mind "has been distorted by philosophers when they think of persons only as passive observers and not as self-willed agents". In his subsequent books, Hampshire sought to shift [[moral philosophy]] from its focus on the logical properties of moral statements to what he considered the crucial question of ''moral problems as they present themselves to us as practical agents.''

In 1960, Stuart Hampshire was elected a member of the [[British Academy]]<ref name=":1" /> and became [[Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic]] at University College London, succeeding [[A. J. Ayer]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> His international reputation was growing and from 1963 to 1970 he chaired the department of philosophy at [[Princeton University]]<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> to which he had happily escaped from the robust atmosphere of London to which his mandarin style, conveyed in a rather preposterous growling accent, was ill-suited, as Ayer implied in his memoirs.  In 1970, he returned to Oxford as [[Warden of Wadham College, Oxford]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Wadham was in the first group of men-only Oxford colleges to admit women in 1974. Hampshire considered his wardenship to be one of his most significant achievements in reviving the fortunes of the college. He was knighted in 1979 and retired from Wadham in 1984, when he accepted a professorship at [[Stanford University]].<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hacker |first=P. M. S. |author-link=P.

His last book, ''Justice Is Conflict'' (1999), inaugurated the ''Princeton Monographs in Philosophy'' series.

Stuart Hampshire wrote extensively on literature and other topics for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' and ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' amongst others.<ref name=":1" /> He was head of the literary panel of the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] for many years. In 1962–63, he was selected by the UK government to conduct a review of the effectiveness of [[GCHQ]].<ref name=":1" />

He married his first wife, Renée Ayer, the former wife of the philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]], in 1961.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> She died in 1980,<ref name=":1" /> and in 1984 or 1985 he married [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]],<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> who was then his colleague at Stanford and is now Professor of Philosophy at [[Durham University]] and at the [[University of California, San Diego]].
