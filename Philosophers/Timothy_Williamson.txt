'''Timothy Williamson''' (born 6 August 1955) is a British [[philosopher]] whose main research interests are in [[philosophical logic]], [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]]. He is the former [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at the [[University of Oxford]], and a fellow of [[New College, Oxford]].

== Education and career ==
Born on 6 August 1955, Williamson's education began at [[Leighton Park School]] and continued at Henley Grammar School (now [[The Henley College (Henley-on-Thames)|the Henley College]]). He then went to [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford University]]. He graduated in 1976 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree with [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours]] in mathematics and philosophy, and in 1980 with a doctorate in philosophy ([[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]]) for a thesis entitled ''The Concept of Approximation to the Truth''.<ref>[https://www.new.ox.ac.uk/node/1034 Timothy Williamson – New College, Oxford]</ref>

Williamson was Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1995–2000), fellow and lecturer in philosophy at [[University College, Oxford]] (1988–1994), and lecturer in philosophy at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] (1980–1988). He took up the Wykeham Professorship in 2000 and retired in 2023, when he took up a Senior Research and Teaching Fellowship in Philosophy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Timothy Williamson|url=https://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/people/timothy-williamson |access-date=9 April 2024 |website=University of Oxford Faculty of Philosophy}}</ref>

He has been visiting professor at [[Yale University]], [[Princeton University]], [[MIT]], the [[University of Michigan]], and the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]].

He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 2004 to 2005.

He is a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA),<ref>[https://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/archive.asp?fellowsID=1187 British Academy Fellowship record] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606071216/https://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/archive.asp?fellowsID=1187 |date=6 June 2011 }}</ref> the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40104|title=Gruppe 3: Idéfag|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|access-date=16 January 2011}}</ref> [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (FRSE), and a Foreign Honorary Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts & Sciences]].

Since 2022 he is visiting professor at the [[Università della Svizzera italiana|Università della Svizzera Italiana]].

== Philosophical work ==
Williamson has contributed to [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] [[philosophy of language]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]].

On [[vagueness]], he holds a position known as [[epistemicism]], which states that every seemingly vague predicate (like "bald" or "thin") actually has a sharp cutoff, which is impossible for us to know. For instance, there is some number of hairs such that anyone with that number is bald, and anyone with even one more hair is not. In actuality, this condition will be spelled out only partly in terms of numbers of hairs, but whatever measures are relevant will have some sharp cutoff. This solution to the difficult [[Sorites paradox]] was considered an astonishing and unacceptable consequence, but has become a relatively mainstream view since his defence of it.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=vagueness |title=Vagueness}}</ref> Williamson is fond of using the statement, "no one knows whether I am thin" to illustrate his view.<ref>[https://philosophy.hku.hk/courses/old/laurencegoldstein/phil2511/lecture7.html Phil 2511: Paradoxes]</ref>

In [[epistemology]], Williamson suggests that the concept of [[knowledge]] is unanalysable. This went against the common trend in philosophical literature up to that point, which was to argue that knowledge could be analysed into constituent concepts. (Typically this would be [[justified true belief]] plus an extra factor.) He agrees that knowledge entails justification, truth and [[belief]], but argues that it is conceptually primitive. He accounts for the importance of belief by discussing its connections with knowledge, but avoids the disjunctivist position of saying that belief can be analysed as the disjunction of knowledge with some distinct, non-[[fact]]ive mental state.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/019925656X.001.0001/acprof-9780199256563|title=Knowledge and its Limits|last=Williamson|first=Timothy|date=2002-10-10|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199256563|doi=10.1093/019925656x.001.0001}}</ref>

Williamson also argues against the traditional distinction of [[Procedural knowledge|knowing-how]] and [[Descriptive knowledge|knowing-that]]. He says that knowledge-how is a type of knowledge-that. Williamson argues that knowledge-how does not relate one's ability. As an example, he gives a ski instructor who knows how to perform a complex move without having the ability to do it himself.<ref>Stanley, J. and Williamson, T. (2001) 'Knowing How', The Journal of Philosophy 98(8): 411–444</ref>

In [[metaphysics]], Williamson defends necessitism, according to which necessarily everything is necessarily something, in short, that everything exists of necessity. Necessitism is associated with the [[Barcan formula]]: it is possible for something to have a property only if there is something which has that property. Thus, since it is possible for [[Wittgenstein]] to have had a child, there is something which is a possible child of Wittgenstein. However, Williamson has also developed an ontology of bare possibilia which he argues alleviates the worst consequences of necessitism and of the Barcan formula. It's not that Wittgenstein's possible child is concrete; rather, it is contingently non-concrete.
