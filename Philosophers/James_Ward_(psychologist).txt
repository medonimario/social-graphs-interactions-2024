'''James Ward''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (27 January 1843 – 4 March 1925) was an English [[psychologist]] and [[philosopher]].<ref name="SEP">[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james-ward/ James Ward (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)].</ref> He was a [[Cambridge Apostle]].

==Life==
Ward was born in [[Kingston upon Hull]], the eldest of nine children. His father was an unsuccessful merchant. Ward was educated at the [[Liverpool Institute]] and [[Mostyn House]], but his formal schooling ended when his father became bankrupt.

Apprenticed to a [[Liverpool]] architect for four years, Ward studied Greek and logic and was a [[Sunday school]] teacher.
In 1863, he entered [[Spring Hill College, Birmingham|Spring Hill College]], near [[Birmingham]], to train for the [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] ministry. An eccentric and impoverished student, he remained at Spring Hill until 1869, completing his theological studies as well as gaining a [[University of London]] BA degree.

In 1869–1870, Ward won a scholarship to Germany, where he attended the lectures of Isaac Dormer in [[Berlin]] before moving to [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] to study under [[Hermann Lotze]]. On his return to Britain Ward became minister at [[Downing Place United Reformed Church, Cambridge|Emmanuel Congregational Church]] in [[Cambridge]], where his theological liberalism unhappily antagonised his congregation. Sympathetic to Ward's predicament, [[Henry Sidgwick]] encouraged Ward to enter [[Cambridge University]]. Initially a [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge|non-collegiate student]], Ward won a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] in 1873, and achieved a first class in the moral sciences tripos in 1874.<ref>{{acad|id=WRT872J|name=Ward, James}}</ref>

With a dissertation entitled ''The Relation of Physiology to Psychology'', Ward won a Trinity fellowship in 1875. Some of this work, ''An Interpretation of [[Fechner's Law]]'', was published in the first volume of the new journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' (1876).

For the rest of his life, the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' reports that he: {{blockquote|...held himself aloof from all institutional religion; but he did not tend towards secularism or even agnosticism; his early belief in spiritual values and his respect for all sincere religion never left him.}}

During 1876–1877 he returned to Germany, studying in [[Carl Ludwig]]'s [[Leipzig]] physiological institute. Back in Cambridge, Ward continued physiological research under [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]], publishing a pair of physiological papers in 1879 and 1880.

From 1880 onwards Ward moved away from physiology to psychology. His article ''Psychology'' for the ninth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' – criticising [[associationist psychology]] with an emphasis upon the mind's active attention to the world – became enormously influential.

Ward was a strong supporter of women's education, and met his Irish-born [[Suffrage|suffragist]] wife-to-be, [[Mary Ward (suffragist)|Mary (née Martin)]], when she attended one of his series of lectures.<ref>{{Cite journal |journal = ODNB|title=Ward [née Martin], Mary Jane|first= Ann |last=Kennedy Smith|date=9 August 2018|doi = 10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.013.111289}}</ref> The couple married in [[Nottingham]] on 31 July 1884, and settled in Cambridge in a house built for them by [[J. J. Stevenson]]. She went on to become a lecturer in moral sciences at [[Newnham College]], and a member of the [[Ladies Dining Society]]. They had two daughters and a son.

Ward was elected to the new Chair of Mental Philosophy and Logic in 1897, his students including [[G.&nbsp;E. Moore]], [[Bertrand Russell]],<ref name="SEP" />  [[Mohammed Iqbal]] and [[George Stout]].<ref>{{acad|id=STT879GF|name=Stout, George, Frederick}}</ref> He served as president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1919 to 1920.

Ward died in Cambridge, and was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium.

==Philosophical work==

Ward defended a philosophy of [[panpsychism]] based on his research in physiology and [[psychology]] which he defined as a "spiritualistic monism".<ref>Vergilius Ture and Anselm Ferm ''A History of Philosophical Systems'' Littlefield, Adams, 1968.</ref><ref>James Ward [https://books.google.com/books?id=gUZmaRrKCJoC ''The Realm of Ends: Or Pluralism and Theism''] Reprint Edition, 2011, Cambridge University Press, p. 13 {{ISBN|0521235502}}.</ref> In his [[Gifford Lectures]] and his book ''Naturalism and Agnosticism'' (1899) he argued against [[materialism]] and [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and supported a form of panpsychism where reality consists in a plurality of centers of activity.<ref>James Ward ''Naturalism and Agnosticism'' New York: Macmillan Company, 1899.</ref> Ward's philosophical views have a close affinity to the pluralistic [[idealism]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ninian Smart|author2=John Clayton|title=Nineteenth-Century Religious Thought in the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03TwgrgNVakC&pg=PA297|access-date=7 April 2012|date=1 July 1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-35965-8|page=297}}</ref><ref>The New Cambridge Modern History: The Era of Violence, 1898–1945, edited by David Thomson, Cambridge University Press, 1960, p. 135.</ref> Ward had believed that the universe is composed of "psychic monads" of different levels, interacting for mutual self- betterment.<ref>Hugh Joseph Tallon ''The Concept of Self in British and American Idealism'' 1939, p. 118.</ref> His theological views have been described by some as a "personal [[panentheism]]".<ref>{{cite book|author=John W.
