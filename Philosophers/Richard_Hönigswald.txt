'''Richard Hönigswald''' (18 July 1875 in [[Magyar-Óvár]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (the present [[Mosonmagyaróvár]] in [[Hungary]]) – 11 June 1947 in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]) was a well-known [[philosopher]] belonging to the wider circle of [[neo-Kantianism]].

==Biography==
Hönigswald studied [[medicine]] and [[philosophy]] under [[Alois Riehl]] and [[Alexius von Meinong]] and from 1916 was professor of philosophy, [[psychology]] and [[pedagogy]] in [[Breslau]] (now [[Wrocław]]). There he supervised [[Norbert Elias]]'s doctorate up to its conclusion in 1924.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Orth|first=Ernst Wolfgang|title=Studien zur Philosophie Richard Hönigswalds|last2=Aleksandrowicz|first2=Dariusz|publisher=Königshausen & Neumann|year=1996|isbn=3-8260-1155-4|location=Wurzburg|pages=180|language=de}}</ref> He also influenced [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] towards philosophy after the latter attended a seminar Hönigswald conducted on the philosophy of language.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Di Cesare|first=Donatella|title=Gadamer: A Philosophical Portrait|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780253007636|location=Bloomington|pages=4}}</ref> From 1930 he was a professor at [[Munich]].  The emphasis of his work lay on the [[cognitive psychology|theory of cognition]] from the point of view of validation and the [[philosophy of language]]. Beyond that, Hönigswald tried to develop a method of teaching that would be applicable to the [[natural sciences]] and the [[humanities]] equally. He also dealt with questions of the psychology of [[thought]] and of pedagogy.

In 1933, as a Jew, he was compulsorily retired after the Law for the Restoration of Professional Civil Service was passed in Germany.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grassl|first=Roswitha|title=Der junge Richard Hönigswald: eine biographisch fundierte Kontextualisierung in historischer Absicht|publisher=Königshausen & Neumann|year=1998|isbn=3-8260-1489-8|location=Wurzburg|pages=11|language=de}}</ref> At the time of the [[Kristallnacht]] (''The Night of Broken Glass'') in 1938, he spent three weeks in [[Dachau concentration camp]]. In 1939 he emigrated with his wife and daughter by way of [[Switzerland]] to the [[United States]].

The discovery of the collection of Hönigswald's unpublished writings led to the so-called third phase of Neo-Kantianism after the phases launched by [[Hermann Cohen]] and [[Paul Natorp]] ([[epistemological]] phase) and [[Heinrich Rickert]], [[Wilhelm Windelband]], and [[Emil Lask]] ([[ontological]]-theoretical phase), respectively.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Anna|first=Giuseppe D'|title=Categories: Histories and Perspectives 2|last2=Fossati|first2=Lorenzo|publisher=Georg Olms Verlag|year=2020|isbn=978-3-487-42276-3|pages=169}}</ref>
