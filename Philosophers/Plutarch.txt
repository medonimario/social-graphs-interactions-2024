==Life==

===Early life===

Plutarch was born to a prominent family in the small town of [[Chaeronea]],{{sfn|Stadter|2014|p=13}} about {{convert|30|km}} east of [[Delphi]], in the Greek region of [[Boeotia]]. His family was long established in the town; his father was named Autobulus and his grandfather was named [[Lamprias]].{{sfn|Russell|2012}} His name is a compound of the Greek words {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πλοῦτος|πλοῦτος]]}}, ({{gloss|wealth}}) and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀρχός|ἀρχός]]}}, ({{gloss|ruler, leader}}). In the [[Ancient Greek personal names|traditional aspirational Greek naming convention]] the whole name means something like "prosperous leader". His brothers, Timon and Lamprias, are frequently mentioned in his essays and dialogues, which speak of Timon in particular in the most affectionate terms. [[Joannes Rualdus|Rualdus]], in his 1624 work ''Life of Plutarchus'', recovered the name of Plutarch's wife, Timoxena, from internal evidence afforded by his writings. A letter is still extant, addressed by Plutarch to his wife, bidding her not to grieve too much at the death of their two-year-old daughter, who was named Timoxena after her mother. He hinted at a belief in [[reincarnation]] in that letter of consolation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Plutarch |translator-first1=Phillip H |translator-last1=De Lacy |translator-first2=Benedict |translator-last2=Einarson |chapter=Consolatio ad Uxorem |title=Moralia |year=1959 |pages=575–605 |series=Loeb Classical Library |publisher=Harvard University Press |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Consolatio_ad_uxorem*.html |via=LacusCurtius |access-date=17 March 2018}}</ref>

Plutarch studied [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]] in [[Athens]] under [[Ammonius of Athens|Ammonius]] from AD&nbsp;66 to 67.<ref name="eb" /> He attended the games of Delphi where the emperor [[Nero]] competed and possibly met prominent Romans, including future emperor [[Vespasian]].{{sfn|Stadter|2014|p=14}} Plutarch and Timoxena had at least four sons and one daughter, although two died in childhood.

Plutarch was either the uncle or grandfather of [[Sextus of Chaeronea]] who was one of the teachers of [[Marcus Aurelius]], and who may have been the same person as the philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]].

===Work as magistrate and ambassador===
In addition to his duties as a priest of the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Delphic temple]], Plutarch was also a [[magistrate]] at Chaeronea and he represented his home town on various missions to foreign countries during his early adult years. Plutarch held the office of [[archon]] in his native municipality, probably only an annual one which he likely served more than once.<ref>{{cite book|title=Plutarch's Lives|last=Clough|first=Arthur Hugh|year=1864|publisher=Liberty Library of Constitutional Classics|chapter-url=http://www.constitution.org/rom/plutarch/intro.htm|chapter=Introduction }}</ref> Plutarch was [[epimeletes]] (manager) of the [[Amphictyonic League]] for at least five terms, from 107 to 127, in which role he was responsible for organising the [[Pythian Games]].

===Late period: priest at Delphi===
[[File:Plutarch and herm.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a philosopher and a [[Herm_(sculpture)|hermaic]] [[stele]] at the [[Delphi Archaeological Museum]]]]

Some time {{circa|AD 95}}, Plutarch was made one of the two sanctuary priests for the temple of Apollo at Delphi; the site had declined considerably since the classical Greek period. Around the same time in the 90s, Delphi experienced a construction boom, financed by Greek patrons and possible imperial support.{{sfn|Stadter|2014|p=20}} His priestly duties connected part of his literary work with the Pythian oracle at Delphia: one of his most important works is the "Why Pythia does not give oracles in verse"<ref>{{cite book |author=Plutarch |title=[[Moralia]] |at=11}}</ref> ({{lang|grc|"Περὶ τοῦ μὴ χρᾶν ἔμμετρα νῦν τὴν Πυθίαν"}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A0%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%AF_%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%BC%CE%B7_%CF%87%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BD_%CE%AD%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B5%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B1_%CE%BD%CF%85%CE%BD_%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD_%CE%A0%CF%85%CE%B8%CE%AF%CE%B1%CE%BD_(%CE%A0%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%8D%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%BF%CF%82) |title=Περί του μη χραν έμμετρα νυν την Πυθίαν (Πλούταρχος) - Βικιθήκη |website=el.wikisource.org |access-date=17 March 2018}}</ref> Even more important is the dialogue "On the 'E' at Delphi" ({{lang|grc|"Περὶ τοῦ Εἶ τοῦ ἐν Δελφοῖς"}}),<ref>{{cite book |author=Plutarch |title=Moralia |chapter=On the 'E' at "Delphi" |language=ancient Greek |url=https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%97%CE%B8%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AC/%CE%A0%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%AF_%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%95%CE%B9_%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%B5%CE%BD_%CE%94%CE%B5%CE%BB%CF%86%CE%BF%CE%AF%CF%82}}

According to Ammonius, the letter ''E'' written on the temple of Apollo in Delphi originated from the [[Seven Sages of Greece]], whose [[Delphic maxims|maxims]] were also written on the walls of the vestibule of the temple and were not seven but actually five: [[Chilon]], [[Solon]], [[Thales]], [[Bias of Priene|Bias]], and [[Pittakos]]. The tyrants [[Cleobulus|Cleobulos]] and [[Periandros]] used their political power to be incorporated in the list. Thus, the ''E'', which was [[Greek numerals|used to represent the number]]&nbsp;5, constituted an acknowledgement that the Delphic maxims actually originated from only five genuine wise men.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

=== Portrait ===

There was a portrait bust dedicated to Plutarch for his efforts in helping to revive the Delphic shrines.{{sfn|Russell|2012}} The portrait of a philosopher exhibited at the exit of the [[Delphi Archaeological Museum|Archaeological Museum of Delphi]], dates to the 2nd&nbsp;century; due to its inscription, in the past it had been identified with Plutarch. The man, although bearded, is depicted at a relatively young age: His hair and beard are rendered in coarse volumes and thin incisions. The gaze is deep, due to the heavy eyelids and the incised pupils.<ref>{{cite web |title=SELECTED EXHIBITS - Archaeological Site of Delphi - Museum of Delphi |url=https://delphi.culture.gr/museum/selected-exhibits/ |website=Delphi.culture.gr |publisher=Delphi Archaeological Museum |access-date=26 October 2022 |date=11 December 2019}}</ref> A fragmentary [[Herm_(sculpture)|hermaic]] [[stele]] ''next'' to the portrait probably did once bear a portrait of Plutarch, since it is inscribed, "The Delphians, along with the Chaeroneans, dedicated this (image of) Plutarch, following the precepts of the Amphictyony" ({{lang|grc|"Δελφοὶ Χαιρωνεῦσιν ὁμοῦ Πλούταρχον ἔθηκαν}} |  {{lang|grc|τοῖς Ἀμφικτυόνων δόγμασι πειθόμενοι}}").<ref>''Syll.''<sup>3</sup> 843=''CID'' 4, no.&nbsp;151 {{full citation|date=July 2021}}</ref>

===Lives of the Roman emperors===
[[File:Nuremberg_chronicles_f_111r_3.png|thumb|Plutarch in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' ]]
Plutarch's first biographical works were the Lives of the Roman Emperors from [[Augustus]] to [[Vitellius]]. Of these, only the Lives of [[Galba]] and [[Otho]] survive. The Lives of [[Tiberius]] and [[Nero]] are extant only as fragments, provided by Damascius (Life of Tiberius, cf. his Life of Isidore),<ref>Ziegler, Konrad, Plutarchos von Chaironeia (Stuttgart 1964), 258. Citation translated by the author.</ref> as well as Plutarch himself (Life of Nero, cf. Galba 2.1), respectively. These early emperors' biographies were probably published under the [[Flavian dynasty]] or during the reign of Nerva (AD 96–98). There is reason to believe that the two Lives still extant, those of Galba and Otho, "ought to be considered as a single work."<ref>Cf. among others, Holzbach, M.-C.(2006). Plutarch: Galba-Otho und die Apostelgeschichte : ein Gattungsvergleich. Religion and Biography, 14 (ed. by Detlev Dormeyer et al.). Berlin London: LIT, p. 13</ref> Therefore, they do not form a part of the Plutarchian canon of single biographies – as represented by the Life of [[Aratus of Sicyon]] and the Life of [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] (the biographies of [[Hesiod]], [[Pindar]], [[Crates (comic poet)|Crates]] and Daiphantus were lost). Unlike in these biographies, in ''Galba-Otho'' the individual characters of the persons portrayed are not depicted for their own sake but instead serve as an illustration of an abstract principle; namely the adherence or non-adherence to Plutarch's morally founded ideal of governing as a [[Princeps]] (cf. Galba 1.3; Moralia 328D–E).<ref name="Cf. Holzbach, op. cit., 24, 67–83">Cf. Holzbach, op. cit., 24, 67–83</ref>

Arguing from the perspective of Platonic political philosophy (cf. Republic 375E, 410D-E, 411E-412A, 442B-C), in ''Galba-Otho'' Plutarch reveals the constitutional principles of the [[Principate]] in the time of the civil war after Nero's death. While morally questioning the behavior of the autocrats, he also gives an impression of their tragic destinies, ruthlessly competing for the throne and finally destroying each other.<ref name="Cf. Holzbach, op. cit., 24, 67–83"/> "The Caesars' house in Rome, the Palatium, received in a shorter space of time no less than four Emperors", Plutarch writes, "passing, as it were, across the stage, and one making room for another to enter" (Galba 1).<ref>The citation from Galba was extracted from the Dryden translation as given at the [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/galba.html MIT Internet Classics Archive]</ref>

''Galba-Otho'' was handed down through different channels. It can be found in the appendix to Plutarch's ''Parallel Lives'' as well as in various Moralia manuscripts, most prominently in [[Maximus Planudes]]' edition where Galba and Otho appear as ''Opera'' XXV and XXVI. Thus it seems reasonable to maintain that ''Galba-Otho'' was from early on considered as an illustration of a moral-ethical approach, possibly even by Plutarch himself.<ref>Cf. Holzbach, op. cit., 24</ref>

===''Parallel Lives''===
{{Main|Parallel Lives}}
[[File:Plutarch Han.jpg|thumb|right|The start of [[Antonio Pacini da Todi|Antonio Pacini's]] Latin translation of the life of Theseus (1440s), dedicated to Cardinal [[Nicola Acciapaccia]]. Shown here from the 1470 [[Ulrich Han]] printing of Plutarch's ''[[Parallel Lives]]''.]]

Plutarch's best-known work is the ''Parallel Lives'', a series of [[biography|biographies]] of illustrious Greeks and Romans, arranged in pairs to illuminate their common [[morality|moral]] virtues and vices, thus it being more of an insight into human nature than a [[History|historical]] account.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Plutarch|title=The life of Alexander|page=1}}</ref> The surviving ''Lives'' contain 23 pairs, each with one Greek life and one Roman life, as well as four unpaired single lives. As is explained in the opening paragraph of his ''Life of Alexander'', Plutarch was not concerned with history so much as the influence of character, good or bad, on the lives and destinies of men. Whereas sometimes he barely touched on epoch-making events, he devoted much space to charming anecdote and incidental triviality, reasoning that this often said far more for his subjects than even their most famous accomplishments. He sought to provide rounded portraits, likening his craft to that of a painter; indeed, he went to tremendous lengths (often leading to tenuous comparisons) to draw [[Physiognomy|parallels between physical appearance]] and [[moral character]]. In many ways, he must be counted amongst the earliest [[ethics|moral philosophers]].{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Some of the ''Lives'', such as those of [[Heracles]], [[Philip II of Macedon]], [[Epaminondas]], [[Scipio Africanus]], [[Scipio Aemilianus]] and possibly [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus]] no longer exist; many of the remaining ''Lives'' are truncated, contain obvious [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] or have been tampered with by later writers. Extant ''Lives'' include those on [[Solon]], [[Themistocles]], [[Aristides]], [[Agesilaus II]], [[Pericles]], [[Alcibiades]], [[Nicias]], [[Demosthenes]], [[Pelopidas]], [[Philopoemen]], [[Timoleon]], [[Dion of Syracuse]], [[Eumenes]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], [[Romulus]], [[Numa Pompilius]], [[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus|Coriolanus]], [[Theseus]], [[Aemilius Paullus]], [[Tiberius Gracchus]], [[Gaius Gracchus]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], [[Sertorius]], [[Lucullus]], [[Pompey]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cicero]], [[Cato the Elder]], [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Junius Brutus]].{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

====''Life of Alexander''====
Plutarch's ''Life of Alexander'', written as a parallel to that of Julius Caesar, is one of five extant tertiary sources on the Macedonian conqueror [[Alexander the Great]]. It includes [[anecdote]]s and descriptions of events that appear in no other source, just as Plutarch's portrait of [[Numa Pompilius]], the putative second king of Rome, holds much that is unique on the early [[Roman calendar]]. Plutarch devotes a great deal of space to Alexander's drive and desire, and strives to determine how much of it was presaged in his youth. He also draws extensively on the work of [[Lysippos]], Alexander's favourite [[sculptor]], to provide what is probably the fullest and most accurate description of the conqueror's physical appearance. When it comes to his character, Plutarch emphasizes his unusual degree of self-control and scorn for luxury: "He desired not pleasure or wealth, but only excellence and glory." As the narrative progresses, the subject incurs less admiration from his biographer and the deeds that it recounts become less savoury. The murder of [[Cleitus the Black]], which Alexander instantly and deeply regretted, is commonly cited to this end.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

====''Life of Caesar''====
Together with [[Suetonius]]'s ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', and [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s own works [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|''de Bello Gallico'']] and ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili|de Bello Civili]]'', the ''Life of Caesar'' is the main account of [[Julius Caesar]]'s feats by ancient historians. Plutarch starts by telling of the audacity of Caesar and his refusal to dismiss [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna|Cinna's]] daughter, [[Cornelia (wife of Caesar)|Cornelia]]. Other important parts are those containing his military deeds, accounts of battles and Caesar's capacity of inspiring the soldiers.

{{quotation|His soldiers showed such good will and zeal in his service that those who in their previous campaigns had been in no way superior to others were invincible and irresistible in confronting every danger to enhance Caesar's fame. Such a man, for instance, was Acilius, who, in the sea-fight at Massalia, boarded a hostile ship and had his right hand cut off with a sword, but clung with the other hand to his shield, and dashing it into the faces of his foes, routed them all and got possession of the vessel. Such a man, again, was Cassius Scaeva, who, in the battle at Dyrrhachium, had his eye struck out with an arrow, his shoulder transfixed with one javelin and his thigh with another, and received on his shield the blows of one hundred and thirty missiles. In this plight, he called the enemy to him as though he would surrender. Two of them, accordingly, coming up, he lopped off the shoulder of one with his sword, smote the other in the face and put him to flight, and came off safely himself with the aid of his comrades. Again, in Britain, when the enemy had fallen upon the foremost centurions, who had plunged into a watery marsh, a soldier, while Caesar in person was watching the battle, dashed into the midst of the fight, displayed many conspicuous deeds of daring, and rescued the centurions, after the Barbarians had been routed. Then he himself, making his way with difficulty after all the rest, plunged into the muddy current, and at last, without his shield, partly swimming and partly wading, got across. Caesar and his company were amazed and came to meet the soldier with cries of joy; but he, in great dejection, and with a burst of tears, cast himself at Caesar's feet, begging pardon for the loss of his shield. Again, in Africa, Scipio captured a ship of Caesar's in which Granius Petro, who had been appointed quaestor, was sailing. Of the rest of the passengers Scipio made booty, but told the quaestor that he offered him his life. Granius, however, remarking that it was the custom with Caesar's soldiers not to receive but to offer mercy, killed himself with a blow of his sword.|''Life of Caesar'', XVI}}

Plutarch's life shows few differences from Suetonius' work and Caesar's own works (see ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' and ''[[De Bello Civili]]''). Sometimes, Plutarch quotes directly from the ''De Bello Gallico'' and even tells us of the moments when Caesar was dictating his works. In the final part of this life, Plutarch recounts details of [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar's assassination]]. It ends by telling the destiny of his murderers, just after a detailed account of the scene when a [[Ghost|phantom]] appeared to [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] at night.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Plutarch|title=The life of Caesar}}</ref>

====''Life of Pyrrhus''====
Plutarch's ''Life of Pyrrhus'' is a key text because it is the main historical account on Roman history for the period from 293 to 264&nbsp;BCE, for which both [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]' and [[Livy]]'s texts are lost.<ref name=TJCornell>{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=T.J. |year=1995 |title=The Beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c.&nbsp;1000–264&nbsp;BC) |publisher=Routledge |page=3 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref>

The remainder of Plutarch's surviving work is collected under the title of the ''Moralia'' (loosely translated as ''Customs and Mores''). It is an eclectic collection of seventy-eight essays and transcribed speeches, including "Concerning the Face Which Appears in the Orb of the Moon" (a dialogue on the possible causes for such an appearance and a source for Galileo's own work),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bakker & Palmerino |title=Motion to the Center or Motion to the Whole?

The ''Moralia'' was composed first, while writing the ''Lives'' occupied much of the last two decades of Plutarch's life.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

====Spartan lives and sayings====
Since Spartans wrote no history prior to the Hellenistic period – their only extant literature is fragments of 7th-century lyrics – Plutarch's five Spartan lives and "Sayings of Spartans" and "Sayings of Spartan Women", rooted in sources that have since disappeared, are some of the richest sources for historians of [[Laconia (ancient region)|Lacedaemonia]].<ref name="Pomeroy, Sarah B. 1999">Pomeroy, Sarah B.; Burstein, Stanley M.; Donlan, Walter; and Tolbert Roberts, Jennifer (1999). ''Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-509742-4}}. {{OCLC|38504496}}.{{page needed|date=May 2019}}</ref> While they are important, they are also controversial. Plutarch lived centuries after the Sparta he writes about (and a full millennium separates him from the earliest events he records); and even though he visited Sparta, many of the ancient customs he reports had been long abandoned, so he never actually saw what he wrote about.<ref name="Pomeroy, Sarah B. 1999"/>

Plutarch's sources themselves can be problematic. As the historians [[Sarah B. Pomeroy|Sarah Pomeroy]], [[Stanley M. Burstein|Stanley Burstein]], Walter Donlan, and Jennifer Tolbert Roberts have written, "Plutarch was influenced by histories written after the decline of Sparta and marked by nostalgia for a happier past, real or imagined."<ref name="Pomeroy, Sarah B. 1999" /> Turning to Plutarch himself, they write, "the admiration writers like Plutarch and Xenophon felt for Spartan society led them to exaggerate its monolithic nature, minimizing departures from ideals of equality and obscuring patterns of historical change."<ref name="Pomeroy, Sarah B. 1999" /> Thus, the Spartan egalitarianism and superhuman immunity to pain that have seized the popular imagination are likely myths, and their main architect is Plutarch. While flawed, Plutarch is nonetheless indispensable as one of the only ancient sources of information on Spartan life. Pomeroy et al. conclude that Plutarch's works on Sparta, while they must be treated with skepticism, remain valuable for their "large quantities of information" and these historians concede that "Plutarch's writings on Sparta, more than those of any other ancient author, have shaped later views of Sparta", despite their potential to misinform. He was also referenced in saying unto Sparta, "The beast will feed again."<ref name="Pomeroy, Sarah B. 1999" />

====''Questions''====
Book IV of the ''Moralia'' contains the ''Roman and Greek Questions'' (Αἰτίαι Ῥωμαϊκαί and Αἰτίαι Ἑλλήνων). The customs of Romans and Greeks are illuminated in little essays that pose questions such as "Why were patricians not permitted to live on the Capitoline?" (no. 91),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/E.html#91|title=Plutarch • Roman Questions, 90‑113|work=uchicago.edu}}</ref> and then suggests answers to them.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

===="On the Malice of Herodotus"====
[[File:Herodotus Massimo Inv124478.jpg|thumb|A bust of the early Greek historian [[Herodotus]], whom Plutarch criticized in "On the Malice of Herodotus"]]

In "[[On the Malice of Herodotus]]", Plutarch criticizes the historian [[Herodotus]] for all manner of prejudice and misrepresentation. It has been called the "first instance in literature of the slashing review".<ref name=NewCriterion/> The 19th&nbsp;century English historian [[George Grote]] considered this essay a serious attack upon the works of Herodotus, and speaks of the "honourable frankness which Plutarch calls his malignity".<ref>{{cite book |last=Grote |first=George |title=A History of Greece: From the time of Solon to 403&nbsp;B.C. |orig-date=1830 |publisher=Routledge |date=19 October 2000 |page=203}}</ref>

Plutarch makes some palpable hits, catching Herodotus out in various errors, but it is also probable that it was merely a rhetorical exercise, in which Plutarch plays [[wikt:devil's advocate|devil's advocate]] to see what could be said against so favourite and well-known a writer.<ref name=Stewart-Long/> According to Barrow (1967), Herodotus' real failing in Plutarch's eyes was to advance ''any criticism at all'' of the city-states that saved Greece from Persia. Barrow concluded that "Plutarch is fanatically biased in favor of the Greek cities; they can do no wrong."<ref>{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=R.H. |title=Plutarch and his Times |orig-date=1967 |year=1979}}</ref>

===Lost works===
The [[Lost literary work|lost works]] of Plutarch are determined by references in his own texts to them and from other authors' references over time. Parts of the ''Lives'' and what would be considered parts of the ''Moralia'' have been lost. The 'Catalogue of Lamprias', an ancient list of works attributed to Plutarch, lists 227 works, of which 78 have come down to us.<ref>Russell, D.A.F.M. (1970) ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, p. 849</ref> The Romans loved the ''Lives''. Enough copies were written out over the centuries so that a copy of most of the lives has survived to the present day, but there are traces of twelve more Lives that are now lost.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Parallel Lives|publisher=Loeb Classical Library Edition|edition=Vol. I|year=1914|chapter=Translator's Introduction|chapter-url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Introduction*.html }}</ref> Plutarch's general procedure for the ''Lives'' was to write the life of a prominent Greek, then cast about for a suitable Roman parallel, and end with a brief comparison of the Greek and Roman lives. Currently, only 19 of the parallel lives end with a comparison, while possibly they all did at one time. Also missing are many of his ''Lives'' which appear in a list of his writings: those of Hercules, the first pair of ''Parallel Lives'', [[Scipio Africanus]] and [[Epaminondas]], and the companions to the four solo biographies.

{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=30em
|"The [[soul]], being eternal, after [[death]] is like a caged bird that has been released. If it has been a long time in the body, and has become tame by many affairs and long habit, the soul will immediately take another body and once again become involved in the troubles of the world. The worst thing about old age is that the soul's memory of the other world grows dim, while at the same time its attachment to things of this world becomes so strong that the soul tends to retain the form that it had in the body. But that soul which remains only a short time within a body, until liberated by the higher powers, quickly recovers its fire and goes on to higher things."
|Plutarch ("The Consolation", ''Moralia'')
}}
Plutarch was a [[Middle Platonism|Platonist]], but was open to the influence of the [[Peripatetics]], and in some details even to [[Stoicism]] despite his criticism of their principles.<ref name="zeller306">Eduard Zeller, ''Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy'', 13th edition, p. 306</ref> He rejected only [[Epicureanism]] absolutely.<ref name="zeller306"/> He attached little importance to theoretical questions and doubted the possibility of ever solving them.<ref name="zeller307">Eduard Zeller, ''Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy'', 13th edition, p. 307</ref> He was more interested in moral and religious questions.<ref name="zeller307"/>

In opposition to Stoic materialism and Epicurean atheism he cherished a pure idea of [[God]] that was more in accordance with [[Plato]].<ref name="zeller307"/> He adopted a second principle (''[[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]]'') in order to explain the phenomenal world.<ref name="zeller307"/> This principle he sought, however, not in any indeterminate matter but in the evil [[Anima mundi|world-soul]] which has from the beginning been bound up with matter, but in the creation was filled with reason and arranged by it.<ref name="zeller307"/> Thus it was transformed into the divine soul of the world, but continued to operate as the source of all evil.<ref name="zeller307"/> He elevated God above the finite world, and thus [[Daemon (mythology)|daemons]] became for him agents of God's influence on the world. He strongly defends freedom of the will, and the immortality of the soul.<ref name="zeller307"/>

Platonic-Peripatetic [[ethics]] were upheld by Plutarch against the opposing theories of the Stoics and Epicureans.<ref name="zeller307"/> The most characteristic feature of Plutarch's ethics is its close connection with religion.<ref name="zeller308">Eduard Zeller, ''Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy'', 13th edition, p. 308</ref> However pure Plutarch's idea of God is, and however vivid his description of the vice and corruption which superstition causes, his warm religious feelings and his distrust of human powers of knowledge led him to believe that God comes to our aid by direct revelations, which we perceive the more clearly the more completely that we refrain in "enthusiasm" from all action; this made it possible for him to justify popular belief in [[divination]] in the way which had long been usual among the Stoics.<ref name="zeller308"/>

His attitude to popular religion was similar. The gods of different peoples are merely different names for one and the same divine Being and the powers that serve it.<ref name="zeller308"/> The [[Greek mythology|myths]] contain philosophical truths which can be interpreted allegorically.<ref name="zeller308"/> Thus, Plutarch sought to combine the philosophical and religious conception of things and to remain as close as possible to tradition.<ref name="zeller308"/> Plutarch was the teacher of [[Favorinus]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Richter |first1=Daniel S. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZ47DwAAQBAJ |title=The Oxford Handbook of the Second Sophistic |last2=Johnson |first2=William Allen |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-983747-2 |page=552 |language=en}}</ref>

[[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]'s  ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' draw extensively on Plutarch's ''Moralia'' and are consciously modelled on the Greek's easygoing and discursive inquiries into science, manners, customs and beliefs. ''Essays'' contains more than 400 references to Plutarch and his works.<ref name="NewCriterion" /> [[James Boswell]] quoted Plutarch on writing lives, rather than biographies, in the introduction to his own ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]''. Other admirers included [[Ben Jonson]], [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Milton]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Joseph De Maistre]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Louis L'amour]], and [[Francis Bacon]], as well as such disparate figures as [[Cotton Mather]] and [[Robert Browning]]. Plutarch's influence declined in the 19th and 20th centuries, but it remains embedded in the popular ideas of Greek and Roman history. One of his most famous quotes was one that he included in one of his earliest works. "The world of man is best captured through the lives of the men who created history."{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

==Translations of ''Lives'' and ''Moralia''==
There are translations, from the original [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], in [[Latin]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. British classical scholar H. J. Rose writes "One advantage to a modern reader who is not well acquainted with Greek is, that being but a moderate stylist, Plutarch is almost as good in a translation as in the original."<ref>[[H. J. Rose]]. ''A Handbook of Greek Literature: From Homer to the Age of Lucian.''. New York: Dutton, 1960. p. 409.</ref>

===French translations===
[[Jacques Amyot]]'s translations brought Plutarch's works to Western Europe. He went to Italy and studied the Vatican text of Plutarch, from which he published a French translation of the ''Lives'' in 1559 and ''Moralia'' in 1572, which were widely read by educated Europe.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle= Amyot, Jacques | volume= 01 | page = 901 |quote=  He was thus enabled to go to Italy to study the Vatican text of Plutarch, on the translation on whose Lives (1559; 1565) he had been some time engaged.}}</ref> Amyot's translations had as deep an impression in England as France, because Thomas North later published his English translation of the ''Lives'' in 1579 based on Amyot's French translation instead of the original Greek.<ref>Denton, John. “Renaissance Translation Strategies and the Manipulation of a Classical Text.

===English translations===
Plutarch's ''Lives'' were translated into English, from Amyot's version, by [[Sir Thomas North]] in 1579. The complete ''Moralia'' was first translated into English from the original Greek by [[Philemon Holland]] in 1603. In 1683, [[John Dryden]] began a life of Plutarch and oversaw a translation of the ''Lives'' by several hands and based on the original Greek. This translation has been reworked and revised several times, most recently in the 19th century by the English poet and classicist [[Arthur Hugh Clough]] (first published in 1859). One contemporary publisher of this version is [[Modern Library]]. Another is ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' in association with the University of Chicago, {{ISBN|0-85229-163-9}}, 1952, {{LCCN|5510323}}. In 1770, English brothers [[John Langhorne (poet)|John]] and [[William Langhorne (clergyman)|William Langhorne]] published "Plutarch's ''Lives'' from the original Greek, with notes critical and historical, and a new life of Plutarch" in 6 volumes and dedicated to Lord Folkestone. Their translation was re-edited by Archdeacon Wrangham in the year 1813.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

===Hebrew translations===
Following some Hebrew translations of selections from Plutarch's ''Parallel Lives'' published in the 1920s and the 1940s, a complete translation was published in three volumes by the [[Bialik Institute]] in 1954, 1971 and 1973. The first volume, ''Roman Lives'', first published in 1954, presents the translations of Joseph G. Liebes to the biographies of [[Coriolanus]], [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Fabius Maximus]], [[Tiberius Gracchus]] and [[Gaius Gracchus]], [[Cato the Elder]] and [[Cato the Younger]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Sulla]], [[Sertorius]], [[Lucullus]], [[Pompey]], [[Crassus]], [[Cicero]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Brutus]], and [[Mark Antony|Mark Anthony]].{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

The second volume, ''Greek Lives'', first published in 1971 presents A. A. Halevy's translations of the biographies of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], [[Aristides]], [[Cimon]], [[Pericles]], [[Nicias]], [[Lysander]], [[Agesilaus]], [[Pelopidas]], [[Dion of Syracuse|Dion]], [[Timoleon]], [[Demosthenes]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Eumenes]], and [[Phocion]]. Three more biographies presented in this volume, those of [[Solon]], [[Themistocles]], and [[Alcibiades]] were translated by M. H. Ben-Shamai.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

The third volume, ''Greek and Roman Lives'', published in 1973, presented the remaining biographies and parallels as translated by Halevy. Included are the biographies of [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius]], [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], [[Agis IV|Agis]] and [[Cleomenes III|Cleomenes]], [[Aratus]] and [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]], [[Philopoemen]], [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]], [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]], [[Flamininus]], [[Aemilius Paulus]], [[Galba]] and [[Otho]], [[Theseus]], [[Romulus]], [[Numa Pompilius]], and [[Poplicola]]. It completes the translation of the known remaining biographies. In the introduction to the third volume Halevy explains that originally the Bialik Institute intended to publish only a selection of biographies, leaving out mythological figures and biographies that had no parallels. Thus, to match the first volume in scope the second volume followed the same path and the third volume was required.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Pseudo-Plutarch==
