{{Short description|4th-century BC Greek Cyrenaic philosopher}}
'''Anniceris''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀννίκερις}}; fl. 300 BC) was a [[Cyrenaic]] philosopher. He argued that pleasure is achieved through individual acts of gratification which are sought for the pleasure that they produce, but he also laid great emphasis on the love of family, country, friendship and gratitude, which provide pleasure even when they demand sacrifice.

==Life==
Anniceris was a disciple of [[Parabates]], and a fellow student of [[Hegesias of Cyrene|Hegesias]]. The [[Suda]] says he lived at the time of [[Alexander the Great]] (ruled 336–323 BC).<ref>Suda, ''Anniceris''.</ref> [[Diogenes Laertius]] tells a story that Anniceris ransomed [[Plato]] from [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]], tyrant of Syracuse, for twenty [[Mina (unit)|minas]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, iii. 20. Cf. ii. 86</ref> This may possibly refer to an earlier Anniceris, possibly the celebrated charioteer mentioned by [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]].<ref>Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', ii. 27.</ref><ref name="EB1911"/>

==Philosophy==
{{main|Cyrenaics}}
Anniceris denied that pleasure was merely the absence of pain, for if so death would be a pleasure; and furthermore he denied that pleasure is the ''general'' goal of human life. To each separate action, there is a ''particular'' end, namely the pleasure which actually results from it.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anniceris|volume=2|page=74}}</ref> He differed from [[Aristippus]] because he allowed that friendship, patriotism, and similar virtues, were good in themselves; saying that the wise person will derive pleasure from such qualities, even though they cause occasional trouble, and that a friend should be chosen not only for our own need, but for kindness and natural affection.

He also denied that reason ({{langx|el|ὁ λόγος}}) alone can secure us from error; the wise person is the person who has acquired a habit of wise action; human wisdom is liable to lapses at any moment.<ref name="EB1911"/><ref>{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 96-97}}; Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromata''. ii.</ref>

The Annicerean (Ἀννικέρειος) sect originated from him.<ref>[https://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/sol/sol-entries/alpha/2466 Suda, alpha, 2466]</ref>
