'''Désiré Félicien François Joseph Mercier''' (21 November 1851 – 23 January 1926) was a [[Catholic Church in Belgium|Belgian Catholic]] prelate who served as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mechelen–Brussels|Archbishop of Mechelen]] from 1906 until his death in 1926. A [[Thomism|Thomist]] scholar, he had several of his works translated into other European languages. He was known for his book, ''Les origines de la psychologie contemporaine'' (1897). He was elevated to the [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinalate]] in 1907.

Mercier is noted for his staunch resistance to the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I]]. After the invasion, he distributed a strong pastoral letter, ''Patriotism and Endurance'', to be read in all his churches, urging the people to keep up their spirits. He served as a model of resistance.

==Biography==
===Early life and ordination===
Mercier was born at the [[château]] du Castegier in [[Braine-l'Alleud]], as the fifth of seven children of small business owners Paul-Léon Mercier and his wife, Anne-Marie Barbe Croquet. Three of Mercier's sisters became religious sisters. His brother Léon became a [[physician]].<ref>Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church. [http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios-m.htm#Mercier "Mercier, Desiré"], fiu.edu. Accessed 25 February 2024.</ref>

One of Mercier's maternal uncles was Adrien Croquet. In the 1860s Croquet became a missionary to the [[Grand Ronde Indian Reservation]] in western [[Oregon]] near the Pacific coast, where his surname was anglicized to Crockett. In the 1870s, a Mercier cousin, Joseph Mercier, joined their uncle Croquet in Oregon. He married a woman of one of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes resident there. Today, several thousand descendants of Joseph and his wife are members of the tribe.<ref>Fr. Cawley Martinus, ''Father Crockett of Grand Ronde: Adrien-Joseph Croquet, 1818–1902, Oregon Missionary, 1860–1898''</ref>

Mercier studied at the College Saint‑Rombaut of Malines (1863-1868), and entered the [[minor seminary]] at [[Mechelen]] in 1868 to prepare for the church. He attended the [[Major Seminary, Mechelen]], from 1870 to 1873.<ref name=Courtois>{{cite book | chapter-url = https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/mercier_desire_joseph | last = Courtois | first = Luc | chapter = Mercier, Désiré Joseph | title = International Encyclopedia of the First World War | journal = 1914-1918-online | year = 2017 |editor=Ute Daniel |editor2=Peter Gatrell |editor3=Oliver Janz |editor4=Heather Jones |editor5=Jennifer Keene |editor6=Alan Kramer |editor7=Bill Nasson | publisher = Freie Universität Berlin | location =Berlin | access-date = 15 November 2017 | doi=10.15463/ie1418.10207/1.1}}</ref>

Mercier received the clerical [[tonsure]] in 1871, and was [[Holy orders in the Catholic Church|ordained]] to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] by Archbishop [[Giacomo Cattani]], the [[nuncio]] to Belgium, on 4 April 1874. Mercier continued with graduate studies, obtaining his [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology|licentiate in theology]] (1877) and [[doctorate]] in [[philosophy]] from the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|University of Louvain]].<ref name=Courtois/>

===Thomist scholarship===
He returned to Malines in 1877 and taught philosophy at the minor seminary and soon after was named spiritual director of the seminarians. His comprehensive knowledge of [[Thomas Aquinas]] earned him the newly erected [[Professor|chair]] of [[Thomism]] at [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Louvain's Catholic university]] in 1882.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Roolf |first=Christoph |title=Mercier, Désiré Joseph |url=https://doi.org/10.1163/2352-3786_dlws1_beww1_en_0390 |journal=Brill's Digital Library of World War I |doi=10.1163/2352-3786_dlws1_beww1_en_0390}}</ref> It was in this post, which he retained until 1905, that he forged a lifelong friendship with Dom [[Columba Marmion]], an [[Ireland|Irish]] Thomist. Raised to the rank of [[monsignor]] on 6 May 1887, Mercier founded the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy]] at the Louvain University in 1899, which was to be a beacon of [[Neo-scholasticism|neo-Thomist philosophy]].{{cn|date=February 2024}}

He founded in 1894 and edited until 1906 the ''Revue Néoscholastique'', and wrote in a [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] manner on [[metaphysics]], philosophy, and psychology. Several of his works were translated into English, German, Italian, Polish, and Spanish. His most important book was ''Les origines de la psychologie contemporaine'' (1897).{{sfn|Colby|Williams|1916|pages=430–431}}

===Bishop and cardinal===
[[File:Cardinal Mercier by Cecilia Beaux - Museum Syndicate.jpg|thumb|''Cardinal Mercier'' by [[Cecilia Beaux]], 1919]]
[[File:Désiré-Joseph Mercier.jpg|thumb|Mercier is commemorated by this statue outside [[St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral]] in [[Brussels]] by [[Égide Rombaux]]]]
His reputation within his field gained the recognition of [[Pope Pius X]], and Mercier was appointed as [[Archbishop of Brussels-Mechelen|Archbishop of Mechelen]] and [[primate (bishop)|Primate]] of [[Belgium]] on 7 February 1906. He received his [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopal consecration]] on the following 25 March from Archbishop [[Antonio Vico (cardinal)|Antonio Vico]], and took as his episcopal [[motto]]: ''Apostolus Jesu Christi''. Mercier was created [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal priest]] by [[Pope Pius X]] in the [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of 15 April 1907.<ref>{{cite book | access-date = 26 January 2021 | title= Acta Sanctae Sedis |url = http://www.vatican.va/archive/ass/documents/ASS-40-1907-ocr.pdf| pages= 261–2 | volume = XXXX| date= 1907 }}</ref><ref name=Courtois/> Three days later Pope Pius gave him his cardinal's ring and assigned him the titular church of [[San Pietro in Vincoli|S. Pietro in Vincoli]].<ref>{{cite book | access-date = 26 January 2021 | title= Acta Sanctae Sedis |url = http://www.vatican.va/archive/ass/documents/ASS-40-1907-ocr.pdf| pages= 263–266 | volume = XXXX| date= 1907 }}</ref>

During the [[modernism in the Catholic Church|modernist]] controversy, Mercier was both progressive and antimodernist. He sought to assess the compatibility of Thomistic philosophy with rapidly developing scientific knowledge.<ref>Aubert, Roger. ''Désiré Mercier and the Origins of the Institute of Philosophy''.</ref> He was a brilliant scholar, open to contemporary ideas and sufficiently respected for being able to protect scholars at Louvain, such as [[Bollandist]] [[Hippolyte Delehaye]], from accusations of "modernism". Through his influence, Mercier prevented [[Albin van Hoonacker]]'s ''Les douze petits prophètes traduits et commentés'' ["The twelve minor prophets translated and annotated"] from being placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]]''.<ref name=devolder/>

Mercier was a close friend of [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Lambert Beauduin]] and kept apprised of liturgical and ecumenical developments. From 1921 to 1926 he held the regular [[Malines Conversations]] with [[Anglican doctrine|Anglican]] [[Theology|theologians]], notably [[Charles Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax]], foreshadowing the Catholic Church's [[Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission|future dialogue with the Anglicans]]. Anglicanism, Mercier believed, must be "united, not absorbed".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930065941/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951781-10,00.html "A Pope on British Soil"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 7 June 1982.</ref>

[[Pope Benedict XV]] sent his portrait and a letter of whole-hearted support to Mercier in 1916, and at one point told him, "You saved the Church!"{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Mercier was one of the [[Cardinal electors for the 1922 papal conclave|cardinal electors]] in the [[1922 papal conclave]], which selected [[Pope Pius XI]].{{cn|date=February 2024}}

===World War I German occupation===
{{Main|Belgium in World War I}}
[[File:"Cardinal Mercier has appealed to the Food Administration for more food for starving millions. Eat less wheat- meat... - NARA - 512580.jpg|right |thumb |Poster from the [[United States Food Administration]] during World War I]]
In 1914, the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] attempted a [[Schlieffen Plan|surprise invasion]] of [[France]] by invading [[Neutral country|neutral]] Belgium. Mercier had to leave his [[diocese]] on 20 August of that same year to attend the funeral of the late Pius X, and [[Cardinal electors for the 1914 papal conclave|participate]] in the following [[1914 papal conclave|conclave]] to elect a new pope.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

Returning from the conclave Mercier passed through the [[Port of Le Havre]], where he visited wounded Belgian, French and British troops. Once back in his archdiocese, he found [[St. Rumbolds Cathedral|Mechelen Cathedral]] to have been partially destroyed. In the [[Imperial German]] atrocities that ensued in the [[Rape of Belgium]], thirteen of the priests in Mercier's diocese were killed, not to mention many civilians, by Christmas 1914. With his pastoral letter, ''Patriotism and Endurance'', of Christmas 1914, Mercier came to personify Belgian resistance to the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|German occupation]]. The [[pastoral letter]] had to be distributed by hand as the Germans had cut off the postal service. Mercier's passionate, unflinching words were taken to heart by the suffering Belgians. He sometimes became a focus of Allied propaganda during the war.<ref name=devolder>[https://books.google.com/books?id=oG10DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA19 De Volder, Jan. ''Cardinal Mercier in the First World War'', Leuven University Press, 2018]; {{ISBN|9789462701649}}</ref> He was kept under house arrest by the Germans, and many priests who had read the letter aloud in public were arrested.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

In Ireland, Cardinal Mercier's detention and indeed the German occupation was used to help recruitment for the British Army among Irish Catholics. Following the war, Mercier helped with the re-establishment of the Irish Franciscan College ([[St Anthony's College, Leuven]]), with his friend since their seminary days in Louvain, Mons. [[James J. Ryan]].<ref>''Chronicle'', The Catholic Historical Review, Vol. 10, No. 3 (Oct., 1924), pp. 416-431.

===Final years and death===
Following World War I, Mercier undertook an excursion to raise funds to rebuild and stock a new [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)#Library|library]] of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Leuven]]. The original library had been burned by the Germans in the war. In his travels to raise funds, Mercier visited New York City for the only time. In 1919, he addressed the General Convention of the Episcopal Church in Detroit, expressing gratitude for [[American Relief Administration|American relief efforts]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Parsons |first=Edward Lambe |date=1961 |title=Recollections of General Conventions, 1901-1937 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42972920 |journal=Historical Magazine of the Protestant Episcopal Church |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=72–92 |jstor=42972920 |issn=0018-2486}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Convention |first=Episcopal Church General |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cV3iAAAAMAAJ&q=mercier&pg=PA375 |title=Journal of the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America Held in the City of Detroit from October Eighth to October Twenty-fourth, Inclusive, in the Year of Our Lord 1919, with Appendices |date=1920 |publisher=convention |language=en}}</ref> Among other projects, Mercier also unsuccessfully attempted to have the [[League of Nations mandate]] of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] awarded to Belgium.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aubert |first1=Roger |title=Les démarches du cardinal Mercier en vue de l'octroi à la Belgique d'un mandat sur la Palestine |journal=Bulletins de l'Académie Royale de Belgique |date=1979 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=166–228 |doi=10.3406/barb.1979.55400 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/barb_0001-4133_1979_num_65_1_55400}}</ref>

Mercier suffered from persistent [[dyspepsia]]. In early January 1926 he underwent [[surgery]] for a [[lesion]] of the [[stomach]]. During surgery, the [[Anesthesia|anesthetized]] cardinal held a conversation with his surgeon.<ref name=time>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930075504/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,728852,00.html "Mercier"], time.com, 11 January 1926.</ref>

In his final days, Mercier was visited by [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert]] and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876-1965)|Queen Elisabeth]], [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], and family members. He entered a deep [[coma]] around 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on 23 January and died an hour later, at age 74.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930215125/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786625,00.html "In Belgium"], time.com, 1 February 1926.</ref> The cardinal was buried at [[St. Rumbolds Cathedral]].

===Inter-Belgian relations===
Mercier is known for favouring French speakers and opposing the use of the [[Dutch language]]. Though in general social-minded, he was blind to the social aspects of the [[Flemish Movement]] and opposed many of its aims. Two examples. (1) Claiming that Dutch could never be a full-fledged cultural language, he fought all attempts to have Flemish high school and university students educated in their native Dutch. He relented only when overwhelmed by the political pressure the Flemish Movement was generating.<ref> Boudens, Robrecht & Lieve Gevers. "Mercier, Désiré J." ''Nieuwe Encyclopedie van de Vlaamse Beweging.'' Tielt: Lannoo, 1998, pp. 2035–2037.</ref> He managed to have [[Pope Benedict XV]] address him a letter<ref>''Cum semper, ut ipsi'', dated February 10, 1921. Full text (in Italian, despite its Latin title) available [https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xv/it/letters/1921/documents/hf_ben-xv_let_19210210_cum-semper.html here].</ref> in which he admonished priests that they should not address arguments extraneous to their supernatural commitment nor publish on secular subjects without their superior's permission. Mercier promptly published this letter.

===Church and science===
Mercier recognized the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] talent of [[Georges Lemaître]] as a young seminarian, and urged him to study [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Theory of relativity|theories of relativity]]. Lemaître became an early expert in [[general relativity]] as it applied to cosmological questions. 

He went on to propose an expanding model of the universe, based on both Einstein's and [[Willem de Sitter|de Sitter]]'s models. [[Georges Lemaître|Abbé Georges Lemaître]] developed his "primeval atom" hypothesis, together with researchers of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Louvain]], and [[George Gamow|Gamow]], [[Ralph Asher Alpher|Alpher]] and [[Robert Herman|Herman]] into the better known [[Big Bang]] theory of the origin of the universe.
