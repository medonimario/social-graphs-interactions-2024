'''Juan de Mariana''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Society of Jesus|SJ]]}} also known as '''Father Mariana''' (25 September 1536 – 17 February 1624), was a Spanish [[Jesuit]] [[Catholic priest|priest]], [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]], [[historian]], and member of the [[Monarchomachs]].<ref>Wm. A. Dunning. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2140284 The Monarchomachs]." ''Political Science Quarterly'' 19, no. 2 (1904): 277–301. {{doi|10.2307/2140284}}.</ref>

==Life==
Juan de Mariana was born in [[Talavera de la Reina|Talavera]], [[Kingdom of Toledo]]. He studied at the [[Complutense University]] of [[Alcalá de Henares]] and was admitted at the age of 17 into the [[Society of Jesus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1561, he went to teach theology in [[Rome]], reckoning among his pupils [[Robert Bellarmine]], afterwards cardinal; then passed into [[Sicily]]; and in 1569 he was sent to [[Paris]], where his expositions of the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]] attracted large audiences. In 1574, owing to ill health, he obtained permission to return to Spain; the rest of his life being passed at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]' house in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in vigorous literary activity.  He died in [[Madrid]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Works==
Juan de Mariana's great work, ''Historiae de rebus Hispaniae'', first appeared in twenty books at Toledo in 1592; ten books were subsequently added (1605), bringing the work down to the accession of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1519, and in a still later abstract of events the author completed it to the accession of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] in 1621. It was so well received that Mariana was induced to translate it into Spanish (the first part in 1601; completed, 1609; English translation by J. Stevens, 1699).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Mariana's ''Historiae'', though in many parts uncritical, is regarded for its research, accuracy, sagacity and style. Of his other works the most interesting is the treatise ''[[De rege et regis institutione]]'' (''On the king and the royal institution'', Toledo, 1598).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=A. D.|date=2009-04-03|title=Juan de Mariana and Early Modern Spanish Political Thought (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/261927|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|language=en|volume=95|issue=2|pages=360–361|doi=10.1353/cat.0.0414|s2cid=154661670|issn=1534-0708}}</ref> In its sixth chapter the question whether it is lawful [[tyrannicide|to overthrow]] a tyrant is freely discussed and answered in the affirmative, a circumstance which brought much odium upon the Jesuits, especially after the assassination of [[Henry IV of France]], in 1610. A volume entitled ''Tractatus VII. theologici et historici'' (published by Mariana in [[Cologne]] in 1609, containing in particular a tract, ''De morte et immortalitate'', and another, ''[[De monetae mutatione]]'' (''On the Alteration of Money''), where Mariana critized the royal monetary politic, was put upon the [[Index Expurgatorius]], and led to the confinement of its author by the [[Inquisition]] and to a process for ''[[lèse-majesté]]''.<ref>{{cite book|language=en|last1=Decock|first1=Wim|chapter=Spanish Scholastics on Money and Credit|title=Money in the Western Legal Tradition: Middle Ages to Bretton Woods|editor1=D. Fox|editor2=W. Ernst|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2016|pages=272–277}}</ref> It has been suggested that either the ''De rege et regis institutione'' or the ''De monetae mutatione'' influenced Chapter 29 of Part One of Cervantes's ''[[Don Quijote]]''. During his confinement there was found among his papers a criticism upon the Jesuits, which was printed after his death as ''[[Discursus de erroribus qui in forma gubernationis societatis Jesu occurrunt]]'' (''A discourse on the sickness of the Jesuit order'', Bordeaux, 1625), and was reprinted by order of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] when he banished the Jesuits from Spain.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

According to [[Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson]], an academic economist specializing in the [[School of Salamanca]], Juan de Mariana and the Spanish scholastics provided much of the theoretical basis for [[Austrian School]] economic thought.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Huerta de Soto |first1=Jesús |author-link1=Jesús Huerta de Soto |editor1-last=Holcombe |editor1-first=Randall G. |editor1-link=Randall G.
