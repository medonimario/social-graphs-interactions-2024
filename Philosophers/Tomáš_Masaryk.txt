'''Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk'''{{efn|{{IPA|cs|ˈtomaːʒ ˈɡarɪk ˈmasarɪk|lang}}}} (7&nbsp;March 1850{{snd}}14&nbsp;September 1937) was a [[Czechoslovaks|Czechoslovak]] statesman, [[Progressivism|progressive]] political activist and philosopher who served as the first [[List of presidents of Czechoslovakia|president of Czechoslovakia]] from 1918 to 1935. He is regarded as the [[Father of the Nation|founding father]] of [[Czechoslovakia]].

Born in [[Hodonín]], [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravia]] (then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]), Masaryk obtained a doctorate at the [[University of Vienna]] and was a professor of philosophy at the [[Charles University|Czech Charles-Ferdinand University]]. He began his political career as a deputy of the Austrian ''[[Imperial Council (Austria)|Reichsrat]]'', serving from 1891 to 1893 and from 1907 to 1914. He was an advocate of restructuring the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] into a [[federal state]], but by the outbreak of the [[First World War]], he had become a supporter of Czech and Slovak independence. He went into exile, and travelled around Europe to organise and promote the Czechoslovak cause. He played a pivotal role in the establishment of the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], which fought against the [[Central Powers]] during the war. In 1918, Masaryk, along with his protégés [[Edvard Beneš]] and [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]], travelled to the United States to obtain support from President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]]. Their negotiations resulted in the [[Czechoslovak declaration of independence|Washington Declaration]], which proclaimed the independence of a Czechoslovak state.

With the fall of Austria-Hungary in late 1918, the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]] received recognition from the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] and Masaryk was recognised as head of its provisional government. He was formally elected president in November, and was reelected three times subsequently. Masaryk presided over a period of stability as Czechoslovakia emerged as a strong democratic state. He resigned from office in 1935 due to old age, and was succeeded by Beneš. He retired to the village of [[Lány (Kladno District)|Lány]] and died two years later at the age of 87.

==Early life==
Masaryk was born to a poor, working-class family in the predominantly Catholic city of [[Hodonín]], [[Margraviate of Moravia]], in [[Moravian Slovakia]] (in the present-day [[Czech Republic]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]). The nearby [[Slovakia|Slovak]] village of [[Kopčany]], the home of his father Jozef, also claims to be his birthplace.<ref>Michaláč, Jozef 2007 T.G. Masaryk a kopčianska legenda. Kde sa v skutočnosti narodil náš prvý prezident? Bratislava: Nestor.</ref> Masaryk grew up in the village of [[Čejkovice (Hodonín District)|Čejkovice]], in [[South Moravian Region|South Moravia]], before moving to [[Brno]] to study.<ref name=capek>Čapek, Karel. 1995 [1935–1938]. ''Talks with T.G. Masaryk'', tr. Michael Henry Heim. North Haven, CT: Catbird Press, p. 77.</ref>

His father, Jozef Masárik, was Slovak, born in [[Kopčany]], [[Slovakia]]. Jozef Masárik was a carter and, later, the steward and coachman at the imperial estate in the nearby town of Hodonín. Tomáš's mother, Teresie Masaryková (née Kropáčková), was a [[Moravians|Moravian]] of [[Slavs|Slavic]] origin who received a German education. A cook at the estate, she met Masárik and they married on 15 August 1849.

==Education==
After grammar school in [[Brno]] and [[Vienna]] from 1865<ref>{{citation |language = cs|title = Brno, Studium na gymnáziu, návštěvy města|url = http://tg-masaryk.cz/mapa/index.jsp?id=43&misto=Studium-na-gymnaziu,-navstevy-mesta|publisher = Masarykův ústav a Archiv AV ČR|access-date = March 2, 2019}}</ref> to 1872, Masaryk attended the [[University of Vienna]] and was a student of [[Franz Brentano]].<ref name=routledge>Zumr, Joseph. 1998. "Masaryk, Tomáš Garrigue (1850–1937)". pp. 165–66 in the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', ed. Edward Craig. London: Routledge.</ref> He received his Ph.D. from the university in 1876 and completed his [[habilitation]] thesis, ''Der Selbstmord als soziale Massenerscheinung der modernen Civilisation'' (''Suicide as a Social Mass Phenomenon of Modern Civilization''), there in 1879.<ref name=routledge /> From 1876 to 1879, Masaryk studied in [[Leipzig]] with [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Edmund Husserl]].<ref>Čapek, Karel. 1995 [1935–1938]. Talks with T.G. Masaryk, tr. [[Michael Henry Heim]]. North Haven, CT: Catbird Press, p. 33</ref> He married [[Charlotte Garrigue]], whom he had met while a student in Leipzig, on 15 March 1878. They lived in Vienna until 1881, when they moved to [[Prague]].

Masaryk was appointed professor of philosophy at the Czech Charles-Ferdinand University, [[Charles University#Split into Czech and German universities|the Czech-language part]] of [[Charles University]], in 1882. He founded ''[[Athenaeum (Czech magazine)|Athenaeum]]'', a magazine devoted to Czech culture and science, the following year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lepka |first=Karel |date=2015 |title=Mathematics in T. G. Masaryk journal Athenaeum |location=Copenhagen |publisher=Danish school of education |pages=749–59 |isbn=978-87-7684-737-1}}</ref> ''Athenaeum'', edited by Jan Otto, was first published on 15 October 1883.

Masaryk's students included [[Edvard Beneš|Edward Benes]] and Emanuel Chalupny.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Skola |first=J. |date=1922 |title=Czech Sociology |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2764647 |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=76–78 |doi=10.1086/213427 |jstor=2764647 |issn=0002-9602}}</ref>
[[File:Alte universitaet cossa.jpg|thumb|[[Portico]] of the [[University of Vienna]] [[w:de:Neue Aula (Wien)|building]] where Masaryk studied philosophy.|225px]]
Masaryk challenged the validity of the epic poems ''[[Manuscripts of Dvůr Králové and Zelená Hora|Rukopisy královedvorský a zelenohorský]]'', supposedly dating to the early [[Middle Ages]] and presenting a false, nationalistic Czech [[chauvinism]] to which he was strongly opposed. He also contested the Jewish [[blood libel]] during the 1899 [[Hilsner Affair|Hilsner trial]].<ref>Wein, Martin. 2015. History of the Jews in the Bohemian Lands. Leiden: Brill, pp. 40-43, including Hilsner's biography [https://books.google.com/books?id=wai8CgAAQBAJ&q=brill+wein+bohemian+lands Table of Contents]</ref>

Masaryk was greatly influenced by the 19th-century cult of science.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=30}} The 19th century was an age of tremendous scientific and technological advances, and as such scientists enjoyed immense prestige. Masaryk believed that social problems and political conflicts were the results of ignorance, and that provided that one undertook a proper "scientific" approach to studying the underlying causes it would be possible to devise the correct solutions.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=30}} As such, Masaryk saw his role as an educator who would enlighten the public from its ignorance and apathy.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=30}}

==Politician==
Masaryk served in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Reichsrat]] from 1891 to 1893 with the [[Young Czech Party]] and from 1907 to 1914 in the [[Czech Progressive Party]], which he had founded in 1900. At that time, he was not yet campaigning for Czech and Slovak independence from Austria-Hungary. Masaryk helped [[Hinko Hinković]] defend the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]] during their 1909 Vienna [[political trial]]; its members were sentenced to a total of over 150 years in prison, with a number of death sentences.

When the [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, Masaryk concluded that the best course was to seek independence for Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. He went into exile in December 1914 with his daughter, Olga, staying in several places in Western Europe, the [[Russian Empire]], the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]. Masaryk began organizing Czechs and Slovaks outside Austria-Hungary during his exile, establishing contacts which would be crucial to Czechoslovak independence. He delivered lectures and wrote several articles and memoranda supporting the Czechoslovak cause. Masaryk was pivotal in establishing the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] in Russia as an effective fighting force on the Allied side during World War I, when he held a Serbian passport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5.409.html:494171-Srbija-nekada-mamila-kao-Amerika|title=Србија некада мамила као Америка|website=www.novosti.rs}}</ref> In 1915 he was one of the first staff members of the [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]] (now part of [[University College London]]), where the student society and senior common room are named after him. Masaryk became professor of Slavic Research at [[King's College London]], lecturing on the problem of small nations. Supported by [[Norman Hapgood]] T. G. Masaryk wrote the first memorandum to president [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]], concerning to independence of the Czechoslovak state, here in January 1917.<ref>{{cite book |last=Preclík|first=Vratislav|title=Masaryk a legie|pages=12–70, 101–102, 124–125, 128–129, 132, 140–148, 184–190|publisher=Paris Karviná in association with the Masaryk Democratic Movement, Prague|year=2019|language=cs|isbn=978-80-87173-47-3}}</ref>

During World War I and afterwards, Masaryk supported the unification of [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sistek|first=Frantisek|title=Czech-Montenegrin Relations, In: Ladislav Hladký et al., Czech Relations with the Nations and Countries of Southeastern Europe, Zagreb: Srednja Evropa 2019|date=January 2019|url=https://www.academia.edu/41731034|language=en}}</ref>

Masaryk championed [[Feminism|feminist]] causes, being influenced by his wife [[Charlotte Garrigue]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mujrozhlas.cz/their-own-words/feminist-legacy-charlotte-and-tomas-garrigue-masaryk | title=The feminist legacy of Charlotte and Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk • mujRozhlas | date=30 August 2021 }}</ref> Masaryk's progressive ideas strongly influenced [[Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence|Washington Declaration]] of Czechoslovak Independence.

On 5 August 1914, the Russian High Command authorized the formation of a battalion recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. The unit went to the front in October 1914 and was attached to the Russian Third Army.

From its start, Masaryk wanted to develop the legion from a battalion to a formidable military formation. To do so, however, he realized that he would need to recruit Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the legion to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian army; the order was rescinded in a few weeks, however, because of opposition from other areas of the Russian government. Despite continuing efforts to persuade the Russian authorities to change their minds, the Czechs and Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}} Under these conditions, the Czechoslovak armed unit in Russia grew slowly from 1914 to 1917. Masaryk preferred to concentrate on elites rather than public opinion.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=44}} On 19 October 1915, Masaryk gave the inaugural address at the newly opened School of Slavonic Studies at [[King's College London]] on "The Problem of Small Nations in the European Crisis", arguing that on both moral and practical grounds that the United Kingdom should support the independence efforts of "small" nations such as the Czechs.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=44}} Shortly afterwards, Masaryk crossed the English Channel to go to Paris, where he delivered a speech in French at the ''Institut d'études slaves'' of the Sorbonne on "''Les Slaves parmi les nations''" ("The Slavs Among the Nations"), receiving what was described as a "vigorous applause".{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=44}}

During the war, Masaryk's intelligence network of Czech revolutionaries provided critical intelligence to the allies. His European network worked with an American counterespionage network of nearly 80 members, headed by [[Emanuel Viktor Voska]] (including [[George Washington Williams (naval officer)|G. W. Williams]]). Voska and his network, who (as [[Habsburg]] subjects) were presumed to be German supporters, spied on German and Austrian diplomats. Among other achievements, the intelligence from these networks was critical in uncovering the [[Hindu–German Conspiracy]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=237}}</ref><ref name=Masaryk50>{{Harvnb|Masaryk|1970|pp=50, 221, 242}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Voska|Irwin|1940|pp=98, 108, 120, 122–23}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bose|1971|p=233}}</ref> Masaryk began teaching at London University in October 1915. He published "Racial Problems in Hungary", with ideas about Czechoslovak independence. In 1916, Masaryk went to [[France]] to convince the French government of the necessity of dismantling Austria-Hungary. He consulted with his friend professor [[Pavel Miliukov]], a leading Russian historian and one of the leaders of the Kadet Party, to introduce him to various members of Russian high society.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=44}}

In early 1916, the Czechs and Slovaks in Russian service were reorganized as the First Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}} In a rare attempt to influence public opinion, Masaryk opened up an office on Piccadilly Circus in London whose exterior was covered with pro-Czechoslovak slogans and maps with the intention of attracting the interest of those walking by.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=44}} One of Masaryk's most important British friends was the journalist [[Wickham Steed]] who wrote articles in the newspapers urging British support for Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=41}} Another important British contract for Masaryk was the historian [[Robert Seton-Watson]], who also wrote widely in the British press urging British support for the "submerged" nations of the Austrian empire.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=43}} After the 1917 [[February Revolution]] he proceeded to Russia to help organize the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], a group dedicated to Slavic resistance to the Austrians. Miliukov became the new Russian foreign minister in the Provisional government, and proved very sympathetic towards the idea of creating Czechoslovakia. After the Czechoslovak troops' performance in July 1917 at the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Battle of Zborov]] (when they overran Austrian trenches), the Russian provisional government granted Masaryk and the Czechoslovak National Council permission to recruit and mobilize Czech and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (Československý sbor na Rusi, also known as the Czechoslovak Legion – Československá legie). A second division of four regiments was added to the legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 by 1918.

Masaryk formed a good connection with Russian supreme commanders, [[Mikhail Alekseyev]], [[Aleksei Brusilov]], [[Nikolay Dukhonin]] and [[Mikhail Diterikhs]], in [[Mogilev]], from May 1917.

Masaryk travelled to the United States in 1918, where he convinced President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the righteousness of his cause. On 5&nbsp;May 1918, over 150,000 [[Chicago]]ans filled the streets to welcome him; Chicago was the centre of Czechoslovak immigration to the United States, and the city's reception echoed his earlier visits to the city and his visiting professorship at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1902 (Masaryk had lectured at the university in 1902 and 1907). He also had strong links to the United States, with his marriage to an American citizen and his friendship with Chicago industrialist [[Charles R. Crane]], who had Masaryk invited to the University of Chicago and introduced to the highest political circles (including Wilson). Except for president Wilson and the secretary of the state [[Robert Lansing]] this was [[Ray Stannard Baker]], W. Phillips, Polk, Long, Lane, D. F. Houston, [[Sir William Wiseman, 10th Baronet|William Wiseman]], [[Harry Pratt Judson]] and the French ambassador [[Jean Jules Jusserand]]. And [[Bernard Baruch]], Vance McCormick, [[Edward N. Hurley]], Samuel M. Vauclain, [[Colonel House]] too. At the Chicago meeting on 8 October 1918, Chicago industrialist [[Samuel Insull]] introduced him as the president of the future Czechoslovak Republic de facto and mentioned his legions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Preclík|first=Vratislav|title=Masaryk a legie|pages=87–89, 124–128, 140–148, 184–190|publisher=Paris Karviná in association with the Masaryk Democratic Movement, Prague|year=2019|language=cs|isbn=978-80-87173-47-3}}</ref> On 18 October 1918 he submitted to president Thomas Woodrow Wilson "Washington Declaration" ([[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]]) created with the help of Masaryk American friends ([[Louis Brandeis]], Ira Bennett, [[Gutzon Borglum]], [[Franklin K. Lane]], Edward House, [[Herbert Adolphus Miller]], [[Charles W. Nichols]], [[Robert M. Calfee]], [[Frank E. J. Warrick]], [[George W. Stearn]] and Czech [[Jaroslav Císař]]) as the basic document for the foundation of a new independent Czechoslovak state. Speaking on 26 October 1918 as head of the [[Mid-European Union]] in Philadelphia, Masaryk called for the independence of Czechoslovaks and the other oppressed peoples of central Europe.

T.G. Masaryk's heroic defence of the Jewish defendant in the Hilsner Trial left a lasting mark on him and led to a deep interest in Jewish thought, Zionism and interreligious relations.<ref>Wein, Martin. 2015. History of the Jews in the Bohemian Lands. Leiden: Brill, p. 60-63, including Masaryk's biography with a focus on Jewish ties, also see 40-46 on Hilsner Trial itself [https://books.google.com/books?id=wai8CgAAQBAJ&q=brill+wein+bohemian+lands Table of Contents]</ref> At the same time, according to Czech historian [[Jan Láníček]], Masaryk believed that Jews had a "great influence on newspapers in all the Allied countries", and helped the nascent state of [[Czechoslovakia]] during its struggle for independence.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Láníček |first1=Jan|author-link=Jan Lanicek |title=Czechs, Slovaks and the Jews, 1938–48: Beyond Idealisation and Condemnation |date=2013 |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-137-31747-6 |language=en|title-link=Czechs, Slovaks and the Jews, 1938–48: Beyond Idealisation and Condemnation |pages=4, 10|quote=Later on, Masaryk repeated the same story, only instead of using ‘partly managed’ he used the phrase ‘a great influence on newspapers in all the Allied countries'.

With the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, the Allies recognized Masaryk as head of the provisional Czechoslovak government. On 14 November of that year, he was [[1918 Czechoslovak presidential election|elected]] president of Czechoslovakia by the National Assembly in Prague while he was in New York. On 22 December, Masaryk publicly denounced the Germans in Czechoslovakia as settlers and colonists.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=140}}

Masaryk was re-elected three times: in May [[1920 Czechoslovak presidential election|1920]], [[1927 Czechoslovak presidential election|1927]], and [[1934 Czechoslovak presidential election|1934]]. Normally, a president was limited to two consecutive terms by the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|1920 constitution]], but a one-time provision allowed the first president–Masaryk–to run for an unlimited number of terms.

On paper, Masaryk had a somewhat limited role; the framers of the constitution intended to create a parliamentary system in which the [[Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia|prime minister]] and cabinet held actual power. However, a complex system of [[proportional representation]] made it all but impossible for one party to win a majority. Usually, ten or more parties received the 2.6 per cent of votes needed for seats in the National Assembly. With so many parties represented, no party even approached the 151 seats needed for a majority; indeed, no party ever won more than 25 per cent of the vote. These factors resulted in frequent changes of government; Masaryk's tenure saw ten cabinets headed by nine statesmen. Under the circumstances, Masaryk's presence gave Czechoslovakia a large measure of stability. This stability, combined with his domestic and international prestige, gave Masaryk's presidency more power and influence than the framers of the constitution intended.

He used his authority in Czechoslovakia to create the [[Hrad (politics)|Hrad]] (the Castle), an extensive, informal political network. Under Masaryk's watch, Czechoslovakia became the strongest democracy in Central Europe. Masaryk's status as a Protestant leading a mainly Catholic nation led to criticism, as did his promotion of the 15th-century proto-Protestant [[Jan Hus]] as a symbol of Czech nationalism.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=123}}

There were founded "The Masaryk Academy of Labour", for the scientific study of scientific management too, with the Masaryk's supporting in [[Prague]] in [[1918]] and Masaryk University in [[Brno]].<ref>Preclík, Vratislav: K stému výročí vzniku Masarykovy akademie práce (One hundred years of the Masaryk Academy of Labour), in Strojař (The Machinist): Journal of MA, časopis Masarykovy akademie práce, January–June 2020, year XXIX., issue 1, 2., ISSN 1213-0591, registrace Ministerstva kultury ČR E13559, pp. 2–20</ref>

Masaryk visited France, Belgium, England, Egypt and the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] in 1923 and 1927. With [[Herbert Hoover]], he sponsored the first Prague International Management Congress, a July 1924 gathering of 120 global labour experts (of which 60 were from the [[United States]]), organized with Masaryk Academy of Labour.<ref>Proceedings from 1.PIMCO "Encyclopedy of Performance", 2500 pages (3 volumes "Man", "Production", "Business") Masaryk Academy of Labour, Prague 1924 - 1926</ref> After the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], Masaryk was one of the first political figures in Europe to voice concern. 

Masaryk resigned from office on 14 December 1935, because of old age and poor health, and was succeeded by [[Edvard Beneš]].

==Death and legacy==
{{main|Death and state funeral of Tomáš Masaryk}}
Masaryk (b. 07 March 1850) died less than two years after leaving office, at the age of 87, in [[Lány (Kladno District)|Lány]] on 14 September 1937. He was buried next to his wife in a plot at Lány cemetery, where later the remains of [[Jan Masaryk]] and [[Alice Masaryková]] were laid to rest.

Masaryk did not live to see the [[Munich Agreement]] or the Nazi occupation of his country, and was known as the Grand (Great) Old Man of Europe.

===Commemorations===

As the [[Father of the Nation|founding father]] of Czechoslovakia, Masaryk is revered by Czechs and Slovaks.

[[Masaryk University]] in [[Brno]], founded in 1919 as Czechoslovakia's second university, was named after him when it was founded; after 30 years as Univerzita [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně|Jana Evangelisty Purkyně]] v Brně, it was renamed for Masaryk in 1990.

Commemorations of Masaryk have been held annually in the Lány cemetery on his birthday and day of death (7 March and 14 September) since 1989.

The Czechoslovak, then Czech [[Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], established in 1990, is an [[order (distinction)|honour]] awarded to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to humanity, democracy and human rights.

He is commemorated by a number of statues, busts, plaques, coins and postage stamps. Although most are in or of the Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]], Masaryk has a [[Statue of Tomas Masaryk (Washington, D.C.)|statue]] on [[Embassy Row]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and in the [[Midway Plaisance]] park in [[Chicago]] and is memorialized in [[San Francisco]]'s Golden Gate Park [[rose garden]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/thomas-garriue-masaryk.html|title = Thomas Garriue Masaryk – Public Art and Architecture from Around the World}}</ref> A plaque with a portrait of Masaryk is on the wall of a hotel in Rakhiv, [[Ukraine]], where he reportedly resided from 1917 to 1918, and a bust was erected in 2002 on Zakhysnykiv Ukrainy Square (former Druzhby Narodiv Square) in [[Uzhhorod]], Ukraine.

[[Avenida Presidente Masaryk]] (President Masaryk Avenue) is a main thoroughfare in the exclusive [[Polanco, Mexico City|Polanco]] neighbourhood of [[Mexico City]]. In 1999 the city of [[Prague]] donated a statue<ref>http://www.mzv.cz/public/60/43/b3/1

In Israel, Masaryk is considered an important figure and a national friend. A village was named after him - [[Kfar Masaryk|Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk]] near Haifa, which was largely founded by Jewish immigrants from Czechoslovakia. One of the main squares in [[Tel Aviv]] is [[Masaryk Square]] (he had visited the city in 1927). In [[Haifa]], one of the junctions in the city was named after him as well. Many cities in Israel named streets after his name, including [[Jerusalem]], [[Petach Tikva]], [[Netanya]], [[Nahariya]] and others.<ref>Martin Wein, A History of Czechs and Jews: A Slavic Jerusalem.

Streets in [[Zagreb]], [[Belgrade]], [[Dubrovnik]], [[Daruvar]], [[Varaždin]], [[Novi Sad]], [[Smederevo]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]] are named Masarykova ulica, and a main thoroughfare in [[Ljubljana]] is named after Masaryk.

==Philosophy==
[[File:Praha, Václavské náměstí, Demonstrace 2011, Nebát se a nekrást.jpg|thumb|Motto "Fear not, and steal not" at a demonstration in Prague, 2011]]
Masaryk's motto was "Fear not, and steal not" ({{langx|cs|Nebát se a nekrást}}). A philosopher and an outspoken [[rationalist]] and [[Humanism|humanist]], he emphasised practical [[ethics]] reflecting the influence of Anglo-Saxon philosophers, French philosophy and—in particular—the work of 18th-century German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who is considered the founder of nationalism. Masaryk was critical of [[German idealism]] and [[Marxism]].<ref>Masaryk, T. G.: Otázka sociální, Praha 1896, German 1898 Otázka sociální: základy marxismu filosofické a sociologické I. a II., MÚ AV ČR, Praha 2000 (6. č. vyd.).</ref>

==Books==
He wrote several books in Czech, including ''The Czech Question'' (1895), ''The Problems of Small Nations in the European Crisis'' (1915), ''The New Europe'' (1917), and ''The World Revolution'' (''Svĕtová revoluce''; 1925) translated into English as ''The Making of a State'' (1927). [[Karel Čapek]] wrote a series of articles, ''Hovory s T.G.M.'' ("Conversations with T.G.M."), which were later collected as Masaryk's [[autobiography]].

==Personal life==
Masaryk married [[Charlotte Garrigue]] in 1878, and took her family name as his middle name. They met in [[Leipzig]], Germany, and became engaged in 1877. Garrigue was born in [[Brooklyn]] to a Protestant family with French [[Huguenots]] among their ancestors. She became fluent in Czech and published articles in a Czech magazine.<ref>see publications: Charlotta Garrigue Masaryková (Charlie Masaryková): „O Bedřichu Smetanovi“ (About B. Smetana), články v Naší době 1893 (Articles in Journal „Naše doba“ 1893),  Epilogue Miloslav Malý, Masarykovo demokratické hnutí (issued by Masaryk's Democratic Movement, Prague, 2-nd edition), Praha 1993</ref> Hardships during the World War I took their toll, and she died in 1923. Their son, [[Jan Masaryk|Jan]], was a Czechoslovak ambassador in London, [[foreign minister]] in the Czechoslovak government-in-exile (1940–1945) and in the governments from 1945 to 1948. They had four other children: Herbert, [[Alice Masaryková|Alice]], Eleanor, and Olga.

Born and raised a [[Catholic]], Masaryk later became a [[Protestant]]; first joining the [[Reformed Church in Austria]] and later the [[Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren]] in 1918 upon Czechoslovak independence, but he was mostly non-practising and rarely attended religious services.<ref name="rozhlas">{{cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/nabozenstvi/mezinebem/_zprava/masarykuv-vztah-k-nabozenstvi--1464205 |title=Masarykův vztah k náboženství |date=7 March 2015 |language=cs |publisher=rozhlas.cz |access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref> His conversion was influenced by the 1870 declaration of [[papal infallibility]] and by his wife Charlotte, who was raised as a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]].<ref name="HaanDaskalova2006">{{cite book|author1=Francisca de Haan|author2=Krasimira Daskalova|author3=Anna Loutfi|title=Biographical Dictionary of Women's Movements and Feminisms in Central, Eastern, and South Eastern Europe: 19th and 20th Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsgQjbgBOAkC&pg=PA306|access-date=2013-08-07|year=2006|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-7326-39-4|pages=306–}}</ref>
