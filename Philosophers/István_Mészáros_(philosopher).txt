'''István Mészáros''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|m|ɛ|s|ər|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|r|oʊ|s}}, {{IPA-hu|ˈiʃtvaːn ˈmeːsaːroʃ|lang}}; 19 December 1930 – 1 October 2017) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Marxist]] philosopher. Described as "one of the foremost political philosophers of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries" by ''[[Monthly Review]]'',<ref name=mr697>{{cite journal | url=https://monthlyreview.org/2017/12/01/mr-069-07-2017-11_0/ | title=István Mészáros (1930–2017) | journal=Monthly Review | volume=69 | issue=7 | date=1 December 2017 | access-date=8 October 2018}}</ref> Mészáros wrote mainly about the possibility of a transition from [[capitalism]] to [[socialism]]. His ''[[magnum opus]]'', ''Beyond Capital: Toward a Theory of Transition'' (1995), was concerned not only with this theme but provided a conceptual distinction between capitalism and capital, and an analysis of the current capitalist society and its "[[organic crisis|structural crisis]]". He was interested in the critique of the "[[bourgeois]] ideology", including the idea of "[[there is no alternative]]", and he also elaborated analysis on the failures of "[[real socialism]]".

==Biography==
===Early life in Hungary===
Mészáros was born in [[Budapest]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]].<ref name=scot>{{cite web | url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-istvan-meszaros-hungarian-marxist-political-philosopher-who-taught-at-st-andrews-1-4616061 | title=Obituary: István Mészáros, hungarian Marxist political philosopher who taught at St Andrews | author-link=Terry Brotherstone | last=Brotherstone | first=Terry | date=18 November 2017 | work=[[The Scotsman]] | access-date=13 October 2018}}</ref> He was raised by his [[single mother]] and his maternal grandmother,{{sfn|Brotherstone|2018|p=328}} and at age twelve falsified his birth date to work along with his mother in an airplane factory building engines.<ref name=mr697/> The poor working conditions would later arise "his lifelong hatred of exploitation and oppression".<ref name=mr697/> When he was 15 or 16,{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=47–48}} Mészáros was introduced to the Marxist philosophy during visits to a bookshop.{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=47}} After having contact with [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', [[Friedrich Engels]]'s ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'', and Marx and Engels's ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', he became interested in the works of [[György Lukács]] about Hungarian literature.{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=47}} Mészáros liked Lukács's works "so much" that he even sold personal belongings to buy them and decided to enter the [[University of Budapest]].{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=47–48}} He did so in 1949 when he won a scholarship with the emergence of a [[Hungarian People's Republic|Communist state in Hungary]].<ref name=mr697/>

At the university, he affiliated himself to the so-called "[[Budapest School (Lukács)|Budapest School]]", a group of Hungarian philosophers who were taught or influenced by Lukács,{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=47}} including [[Ágnes Heller]] and [[György Márkus]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/marxismtotalitya0000jaym | url-access=registration | title=Marxism and Totality | author-link=Martin Jay | last=Jay | first=Martin | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | year=1984 | isbn=9780520057425 | page=[https://archive.org/details/marxismtotalitya0000jaym/page/304 304]}}</ref> During this period, Lukács was very criticised by the [[Hungarian Communist Party]] and [[Mátyás Rákosi]]'s government banned some of his works between 1949 and the mid-1950s.<ref name=mr697/>{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=48}} Because of his allegiance to Lukács and his attendance of Lukács's seminars, Mészáros almost got expelled from the university.{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=48}} Later, Lukács nominated Mészáros as his assistant at the Institute of Aesthetics because of his public contestation of the censorship of [[Mihály Vörösmarty]]'s play ''Csongor és Tünde'' denounced as a "pessimist aberration".<ref name=mr697/> His pro-Vörösmarty essay, published in the literary magazine ''Csillag'', earned him the 1951 [[Attila József Prize]] and helped the reincorporation of the play in the [[National Theatre (Budapest)|National Theatre]]'s repertoire.<ref name=mr697/>

During the 1950s, Mészáros was an active member of the [[Hungarian Writers' Union]] and was involved in artistic and literary circles, notably in the [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Petőfi circle—a group associated with the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].<ref name=mr697/><ref>{{cite book | authorlink2=Philip Green (author) | last1=Benewick | first1=Robert | last2=Green | first2=Philip | title=The Routledge Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Political Thinkers | publisher=Routledge | year=2002 | isbn=9781134864676 | page=151}}</ref><!-- Routledge supports the "anti-Stalinist" bit --> This interest for cultural issues reverberated in his 1955 doctoral dissertation in philosophy entitled ''Szatíra és valóság'' ("Satire and Reality").<!-- <ref name=mr697/> --> In the following year, he was made editor of the cultural magazine ''[[Eszmélet]]'', created by Lukács, composer [[Zoltán Kodály]], and other personalities. Mészáros was also chosen to be an associate professor of philosophy and Lukács's successor at the Institute of Aesthetics.<ref name=mr697/> However, after the defeat of the revolution and Lukács's imprisonment for supporting it, Mészáros verified that "there was no hope for [[socialism|socialist transformation]] in Hungary".{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=49}} So, after the [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|Soviet invasion]] in 1956, he left the country,<ref name=mr697/>{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=47}} becoming one of the first citizens from a Communist country to criticise [[Stalinism]].<ref name="NYRB72">{{cite journal|last1=Bottomore|first1=Tom|last2=Edgeley|first2=Roy|last3=Lerner|first3=Laurence|title=The Case of Dr. Mészáros|journal=The New York Review of Books|issue=30 November 1972|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1972/11/30/the-case-of-dr-meszaros|access-date=27 April 2016|date=1972-11-30|volume=19 }}</ref>

===Academic career in the West===
Mészáros moved to Italy and was a professor at the [[University of Turin]].<ref name=mr697/> During his time in Turin, he wrote a book of memoirs about the Hungarian uprising titled ''La rivolta degli intellettuali in Ungheria'' ("The Revolt of the Intellectuals in Hungary") that was published in 1958 by [[Giulio Einaudi Editore]].<ref name=lrdiu>{{cite book | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=siJIDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT33 | title=La rivoluzione ungherese del 1956 e l'Italia | chapter=Echi e testimonianze della rivoluzione ungherese in Italia: il dibattito a sinistra, il PCI e i 'Libri banchi' Einaudi | author=Carteny, Andrea | publisher={{illm|Rubbettino Editore|it|Rubbettino Editore}} | page=33 | isbn=9788849853537 | year=2018}}</ref> He worked in Italy until moving to the United Kingdom, where he worked at [[Bedford College, London]] (1959–1961) and the [[University of St. Andrews]] (1961–1966).<ref name=mr697/> In 1964, he released the book ''Attila József e l'arte moderna'' through the Milanese publisher {{illm|Lerici (casa editrice){{!}}Lerici|it|Lerici}}.{{sfn|Brotherstone|2018|p=332}}<ref name=lfaj>{{cite journal | url=http://epa.oszk.hu/02000/02025/00010/pdf/RSU_1995_10_147-152.pdf | title=La fortuna di Attila József in Italia | author=Ferroni, Nicoletta | journal=Rivista di Studi Ungheresi | year=1995 | issue=10 | page=150}}</ref> He joined the [[University of Sussex]] in 1966,<ref name=ub546>{{cite journal | title=Visa denial protested | author=Mickleburgh, Rod | journal=The Ubyssey | volume=54 | issue=6 | date=29 September 1972 | url=https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/ubcpublications/ubysseynews/items/1.0128216##p1z-3r0f:meszaros | page=1 | access-date=8 October 2018}}</ref> where he held the Chair of Philosophy.{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=47}} His 1970 book ''Marx's Theory of Alienation'' established his reputation in the English-speaking world,{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=47}} and won him that year [[Deutscher Memorial Prize|Isaac Deutscher Memorial Prize]].<ref name="NYRB72"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.deutscherprize.org.uk/wp/past-recipients/ | title = Past Recipients |year=2016 |work=The Deutscher Prize Web Site |access-date=12 October 2018}}</ref> Receiving the award, he got the opportunity to do the first Isaac Deutscher Memorial Lecture at the [[London School of Economics]] in the following year.<ref name="NYRB72"/> Originally conceived as "Alienation and Social Control" in late 1970,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-zlAAAAMAAJ&q=%22meszaros%22+%22Alienation+and+Social+Control%22 | title=The Isaac Deutscher Memorial Prize for 1970 | journal=[[New Society]] | volume=16 | issue=418–431 | page=970 | year=1970}}<p>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-zlAAAAMAAJ&q=%22meszaros%22+%22Alienation+and+Social+Control%22 | title=Deutscher Prize Goes to Istvan Meszaros | journal=[[Intercontinental Press]] | volume=8 | page=1094 | year=1970}}</p></ref> the lecture was renamed "The Necessity of Social Control".{{sfn|Arthur|McCarney|1992|p=34}} In 1971, it appeared under the title "Alienation and the Necessity of Social Control" in the ''[[Socialist Register]]'',<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZ0gAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Alienation+and+the+Necessity+of+Social+Control%22 | title=Alienation and the Necessity of Social Control | journal=Socialist Register | year=1971 | last1=Miliband | first1=Ralph }}</ref> and was also published by Merlin Press in book-format as ''The Necessity of Social Control''.{{sfn|Arthur|McCarney|1992|p=34}}<ref name=foster>{{cite journal | url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/12/01/meszaros-and-the-critique-of-the-capital-system/ | title=Mészáros and the Critique of the Capital System | author=Foster, John Bellamy | date=1 December 2014 | journal=Monthly Review | volume=66 | issue=7 | doi=10.14452/MR-066-07-2014-11_1 | access-date=13 October 2018}}</ref>

Mészaros was appointed [[emeritus professor]] by Sussex in 1991,<ref name=mr697/> and he won the Lukács Prize in 1992.{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=47}} In 1995, he retired from Sussex, was nominated for the Michael Harrington Award for his work ''Beyond Capital'', and was also elected a member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=mr697/>{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=47}} In the late 1990s, he became an advisor to ''[[Monthly Review]]'' editors [[Harry Magdoff]] and [[John Bellamy Foster]], and also contributed to the magazine and its parent Monthly Review Press.<ref name=mr697/>

In 2009, he won the Venezuelan Premio Libertador al Pensamiento Crítico ("Libertador Prize for Critical Thinking") for his work ''The Challenge and Burden of Historical Time''.<ref name=mr697/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soitu.es/soitu/2009/06/25/info/1245956076_347376.html | title=El húngaro Mészáros gana el Premio Libertador al Pensamiento Crítico en Venezuela | publisher=Micromedios Digitales | website=Soitu.es | author=EFE | author-link=EFE | date=25 June 2009}}</ref> After this work, he also published the two-volume critique of "bourgeois ideology" ''Social Structure and Forms of Consciousnes'': ''The Social Determination of Method'' in 2010 and ''The Dialectic of Structure and History'' in 2011.<ref name=mr697/> Following the publication of latter, he planned to write a sequel for ''Beyond Capital'', entitled ''Beyond Leviathan: Critique of the State''.<!-- <ref name=mr697/> --> Meszáros drafted three volumes, ''The Historic Challenge'', ''The Harsh Reality'', and ''The Necessary Alternative'', with the first volume almost completed.<ref name=mr697/> However, in 2017, he died in [[Margate]], where he was being cared for after a stroke in September made him leave his home in [[Ramsgate]], [[Kent]].<ref name=scot/>{{sfn|Brotherstone|2018|p=327}}

==Thought==
Mészáros was a critic of politicians and philosophers who constantly used the sentence "[[there is no alternative]]".{{sfn|Arthur|McCarney|1992|p=29}} Usually associated with conservative figures like [[Margaret Thatcher]], Mészáros stated it reached [[List of Labour parties|Labour parties]], Communist statesmen like [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and former radicals turned [[post-modernists]].{{sfn|Arthur|McCarney|1992|p=29}} Because of this, he believed [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] was an important philosopher to whom "Marxists owed a great debt to".{{sfn|Arthur|McCarney|1992|p=29}} Critical of Sartre's [[existentialism]], Mészáros praised his opposition to the "there is no alternative" motto and affirmed, "I don't embrace his ideas but I embrace the aim".{{sfn|Arthur|McCarney|1992|p=29}} Mészáros declared, "Sartre was a man who always preached the diametrical opposite: there is an alternative, there must be an alternative; you as an individual have to rebel against this power, this monstrous power of capital. Marxists on the whole failed to voice that side".{{sfn|Arthur|McCarney|1992|p=29}} This was reflected on Mészáros's ''The Work of Sartre: Search for Freedom'', first published in 1979 and expanded in 2012 with a new section, "The Challenge of History".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2013/10/01/book-review-the-work-of-sartre-search-for-freedom-and-the-challenge-of-history/ | title=Book Review: The Work of Sartre: Search for Freedom and the Challenge of History by István Mészáros | author=Nell, Miranda | date=1 October 2013 | publisher=LSE Review of Books | access-date=18 October 2018}}</ref>

Mészáros believed it was important to do a distinction between [[capitalism]] and [[capital (economics)|capital]] to theorise about a transition to socialism.{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=54}} He posited that capital appeared "thousand of years" prior to capitalism and that it can continue without capitalism, which is the case of [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) in his understanding.{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=54}} In this sense, a revolutionary upheaval can overthrow capitalism in a limited area by the [[expropriation]] of the capitalist class, but the power of capital can still control the system through the division of labour and the "hierarchical command structure of capital".{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=54}} Mészáros defined capital as "command system whose mode of functioning is accumulation-oriented".{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=54}} In his conception, the extraction of [[surplus value]] can be done in a "political way"—like in the case of USSR—or through "an economically regulated extraction of [[surplus labour]] and surplus value"—like in the West.{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=54}} Mészáros argued that the accumulation process "was done in a very improper fashion from the point of view of productivity" and in a 1982 essay said that it would eventually collapse because of this fact—and not because of US-backed anticommunist military policies.{{sfn|Osborne|2013|p=55}}

==Personal life==
Mészáros met his Italian wife, Donatella Morisi, in 1955 in Paris; they were married on 14 February 1956; she died in 2007.<ref name=mr697/><ref name=scot/> They had three children: Laura, born 1956; Susie, born 1960; and Giorgio, born 1962.<ref name=mr697/>
