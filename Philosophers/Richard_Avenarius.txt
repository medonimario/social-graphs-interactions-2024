'''Richard Ludwig Heinrich Avenarius''' (19 November 1843 – 18 August 1896) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[philosopher]]. He formulated the radical [[positivist]] doctrine of "[[Empiricism|empirical]] [[Critical philosophy|criticism]]" or [[empirio-criticism]].

==Life==
Avenarius attended the Nicolaischule in [[Leipzig]] and studied at the [[University of Zurich]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], and the [[University of Leipzig]]. At the University of Leipzig, he received the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in 1868 with his thesis on [[Baruch Spinoza]] and his [[pantheism]], obtained the [[habilitation]] in 1876 and taught there as ''[[Privatdozent]]''.  One year later, he became professor at the [[University of Zurich]]. He died in Zürich in 1896.

==Work==
Avenarius believed that [[philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] must be concerned with purely descriptive definitions of experience, which must be free of both [[metaphysics]] and [[materialism]]. His opposition to the materialist assertions of [[Carl Vogt]] resulted in an attack upon empirio-criticism by [[Vladimir Lenin]] in the latter's ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]]''.

Avenarius' principal works are the famously difficult ''Kritik der reinen Erfahrung'' (''Critique of Pure Experience'', 1888–1890) and ''Der menschliche Weltbegriff'' (''The Human Concept of the World'', 1891) which influenced [[Ernst Mach]], [[Ber Borochov]] and, to a lesser extent, [[William James]].<ref>David C. Lamberth, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gKbt8c5y0EkC&dq= ''William James and the Metaphysics of Experience''], Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 86.</ref>

He taught [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] and was also influential on [[Alexander Bogdanov]] and [[Nikolai Valentinov]].

==Family==
Avenarius was the second son of the German publisher Eduard Avenarius and Cäcilie née Geyer, a daughter of the actor and painter [[Ludwig Geyer]] and a (step-)sister of [[Richard Wagner]]. However, there is speculation that her father was the biological father of Richard Wagner too. Richard Avenarius's brother, [[Ferdinand Avenarius]], led the cultural organization [[Dürerbund]] and belonged to the initiators of a culture reform movement in Germany. Wagner was Avenarius's [[godparent|godfather]].{{ref|Wagner}}
