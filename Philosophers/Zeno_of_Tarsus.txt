'''Zeno of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]]''' ({{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Ζήνων|Ζήνων]] ὁ Ταρσεύς}}, ''Zenon ho Tarseus''; fl. 200 BC) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher and the son of [[Dioscorides (Stoic)|Dioscorides]].

==Biography==
Zeno was a pupil of [[Chrysippus]],<ref name="Diog1">{{cite LotEP|chapter=Book VII |§= 35 Cf. 41, 84}}</ref> and when Chrysippus died c. 206 BC, he succeeded him to become the fourth [[scholarch]] of the Stoic school in [[Athens]].<ref name="Euseb1">Eusebius, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_15_book15.htm ''Praeparatio Evangelica,''] 15. 18.</ref>

According to [[Diogenes Laërtius]], he wrote very few books, but left a great number of disciples.<ref name="Diog1"/> According to the testimony of [[Philodemus]], Zeno rebutted the opinions of the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher [[Hieronymus of Rhodes]] in "five books Against Hieronymus" (Philodemus, ''Sto. hist.'', col. 48, fr. 18).<ref>{{Cite book|author1-first=Roger A.|author1-last=Shiner|author2-first=Lawrence John|author2-last=Jost|year=2003|title=Eudaimonia and well-being: ancient and modern conceptions|page=80|publisher=Academic Printing & Publishing}}</ref>

Little is known about Zeno's philosophical views. He was apparently an orthodox Stoic, but doubted the doctrine of the [[Ekpyrosis|conflagration of the universe]].<ref name="Euseb1"/>  This was a considerable modification of the physical theory of the Stoics, who held that the universe periodically dissolved into fire.

It is not known when he died.  He was succeeded as head of the Stoic school by [[Diogenes of Babylon]].
