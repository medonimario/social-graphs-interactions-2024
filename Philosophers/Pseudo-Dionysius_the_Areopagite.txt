'''Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite''' (or '''Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite''') was a [[Greeks|Greek]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Brock|first=Sebastian|date=2011|title=Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite — Gorgias Encyclopedic Dictionary|url=https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Dionysius-the-Areopagite-Pseudo-|website=Gorgias Encyclopedic Dictionary}}</ref> author, [[Christian theology|Christian theologian]] and [[Neoplatonic]] [[philosopher]] of the late 5th to early 6th century, who wrote a set of works known as the ''Corpus Areopagiticum'' or ''Corpus Dionysiacum''.

The author [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphically]] identifies himself in the corpus as "Dionysios", portraying himself as [[Dionysius the Areopagite]], the Athenian convert of [[Paul the Apostle]] mentioned in [[Areopagus sermon|Acts 17:34]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite summary {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/summary/Pseudo-Dionysius-the-Areopagite |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|17:34|NIV}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|name=identity}} 

==Historic confusions==
In the early sixth century, a series of writings of a [[Christian mysticism|mystical nature]], employing [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic language]] to elucidate Christian theological and mystical ideas, was ascribed to the Areopagite.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''] on the confusion between Dionysius and Pseudo-Dionysius</ref> They have long been recognized as [[pseudepigrapha]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2024}}, and their author is now called "Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite".

==Corpus==

===Works===
The surviving corpus comprises:<ref>''Pseudo Dionysius: The Complete Works'', 1987, Paulist Press, {{ISBN|0-8091-2838-1}}.</ref> 
* ''Divine Names'' (''{{lang|grc|Περὶ θείων ὀνομάτων}}'');
* ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia|Celestial Hierarchy]]'' (''{{lang|grc|Περὶ τῆς οὐρανίου ἱεραρχίας}})'';
* ''Ecclesiastical Hierarchy'' (''{{lang|grc|Περὶ τῆς ἐκκλησιαστικῆς ἱεραρχίας}}'');
* ''Mystical Theology'' (''{{lang|grc|Περὶ μυστικῆς θεολογίας}}''), "a brief but powerful work that deals with negative or apophatic theology and in which theology becomes explicitly '[[Mystical theology|mystical]]' for the first time in history";{{sfn|Corrigan|Harrington|2014}}
* Ten [[epistle]]s.

Seven other works are mentioned repeatedly by pseudo-Dionysius in his surviving works, and are presumed either to be lost<ref>Andrew Louth, "The Reception of Dionysius up to Maximus the Confessor", in: Sarah Coakley, Charles M. Stang (eds), ''Re-thinking Dionysius the Areopagite'', John Wiley & Sons, 2011, p. 49.</ref> or to be fictional works mentioned by the Areopagite as a literary device to give the impression to his sixth-century readers of engaging with the surviving fragments of a much larger first-century corpus of writings.<ref>In support of this view, there is no trace at all of these 'lost' treatises: despite the interest in Dionysius from as early as the sixth century, no mention of them is to be found. See Louth, ''Dionysius the Areopagite'', (1987), p. 20.</ref> These seven other works are:
* ''Theological Outlines'' (''{{lang|grc|Θεολογικαὶ ὑποτυπώσεις}}''),
* ''Symbolic Theology'' (''{{lang|grc|Συμβολικὴ θεολογία}}''),
* ''On Angelic Properties and Orders'' (''{{lang|grc|Περὶ ἀγγελικῶν ἰδιοτήτων καὶ τάξεων}}''),
* ''On the Just and Divine Judgement'' (''{{lang|grc|Περὶ δικαίου καὶ θείου δικαστηρίου}}''),
* ''On the Soul'' (''{{lang|grc|Περὶ ψυχῆς}}''),
* ''On Intelligible and Sensible Beings,''{{refn|group=note|Also known as ''The Intelligible and the Sensible''; this is only referred to in the ''Ecclesiastical Hierarchy''.}}
* ''On the Divine Hymns''.{{refn|group=note|This is only referred to in the ''Celestial Hierarchy''.}}

===Dating===
* In the ''Ecclesiastical Hierarchy'' Dionysius twice seems to allude to the recitation of the Creed in the course of the liturgy (''EH'' 3.2 and 3.III.7). It is often asserted that [[Peter the Fuller]] first mandated the inclusion of the [[Nicene Creed]] in the liturgy in 476, thus providing an earliest date for the composition of the Corpus. Bernard Capelle argues that it is far more likely that [[Timothy I of Constantinople|Timothy, patriarch of Constantinople]], was responsible for this liturgical innovation, around 515—thus suggesting a later date for the Corpus.<ref name="John C Lamoreaux 1998 p9">Paul Rorem and John C. Lamoreaux, ''John of Scythopolis and the Dionysian Corpus: Annotating the Areopagite'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), p. 9. The point was first proposed by Stiglmayr.</ref>
* It is often suggested that because Dionysius seems to eschew divisive [[Christology|Christological]] language, he was probably writing after the ''[[Henotikon|Henoticon]]'' of [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] was in effect, sometime after 482. It is also possible that Dionysius eschewed traditional Christological formulae in order to preserve an overall apostolic ambience for his works, rather than because of the influence of the ''Henoticon''. Also, given that the ''Henoticon'' was rescinded in 518, if Dionysius was writing after this date, he may have been untroubled by this policy.<ref name="John C Lamoreaux 1998 p9"/>
In terms of the latest date for the composition of the ''Corpus'', the earliest datable reference to Dionysius' writing comes in 528, the year in which the treatise of [[Severus of Antioch]] entitled ''Adversus apologiam Juliani'' was translated into [[Syriac language|Syriac]]—though it is possible the treatise may originally have been composed up to nine years earlier.<ref>Hathaway, ''Hierarchy and the Definition of Order in the Letters of Pseudo-Dionysius'', p. 4, supports the dating of 519 for this treatise.</ref>

Another widely cited latest date for Dionysius' writing comes in 532, when, in a report on a colloquy held between two groups ([[Dyophysitism|dyophysite]] and [[Miaphysitism|miaphysite]]) debating the decrees of the [[Council of Chalcedon]], [[Severus of Antioch]] and his miaphysite supporters cited Dionysius' Fourth Letter in defence of their view.<ref>Andrew Louth, ''Dionysius the Areopagite'' (1987), reissued by Continuum Press, London & New York, 2001, under the title ''Denys the Areopagite''.</ref> It is possible that pseudo-Dionysius was himself a member of this group, though debate continues over whether his writings do in fact reveal a miaphysite understanding of Christ.<ref>See Louth, ''Dionysius the Areopagite'' (1987), p. 14, who suggests that, although ambiguous, Dionysius is not miaphysite (he also points out that Severus and his supporters misquote Dionysius's Fourth Epistle to back up their view). Paul Rorem and John C. Lamoreaux, ''John of Scythopolis and the Dionysian Corpus: Annotating the Areopagite'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), esp. p. 11, make an extensive study of the early evidence, arguing that (1) Hypatius's apparent rejection in 532 of the works of Dionysite as miaphysite is not as straightforward as often suggested, and that (2) Dionysius's writing was appealed to by just about all parties in the sixth-century Christian east, and at no point was it considered the exclusive preserve of the Miaphysites.
</ref> It seems likely that the writer was located in Syria, as revealed, for example, by the accounts of the sacramental rites he gives in ''The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy'', which seem only to bear resemblance to Syriac rites.<ref>Dionysius' description in the ''Ecclesiastical Hierarchy'' corresponds well with what is known of Syriac worship from other sources, for example: (1) his account of baptism and the Eucharist is similar to the ''Homilies on Baptism and the Eucharist'' of Theodore of Mopsuetsia, which depict worship in the Church of West Syria at the beginning of the fifth century. See Louth, ''Dionysius the Areopagite'' (1987), p. 55; (2) Dionysius' account of the sacrament of oil in the ''Ecclesiastical Hierarchy'' is not found in most other patristic sources, except for those in the Syrian tradition. See Louth, ''Dionysius the Areopagite'' (1987), p. 64; (3) his understanding of monasticism. See Louth, ''Dionysius the Areopagite'' (1987), p. 70. Louth is certain that Dionysius/Denys was writing in Syria. See p.14 and passim.</ref>

===Authorship===
The author pseudonymously identifies himself in the corpus as "Dionysios", portraying himself as the figure of [[Dionysius the Areopagite]], the Athenian convert of [[Paul the Apostle]] mentioned in Acts 17:34.<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|17:34|NIV}}.</ref>{{refn|group=note|name=identity|Acts 17:34: "A few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others."}}

Various legends existed surrounding the figure of Dionysius, who became emblematic of the spread of the gospel to the Greek world. A tradition quickly arose that he became the first bishop of Cyprus or of Milan, or that he was the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews; according to Eusebius, he was also said to be the first bishop of Athens. It is therefore not surprising that that author of these works would have chosen to adopt the name of this otherwise briefly mentioned figure.<ref>Luibheid, Pseudo-Dionysius, (1987), p. 22.</ref>

The authorship of the Dionysian Corpus was initially disputed; Severus and his party affirmed its apostolic dating, largely because it seemed to agree with their Christology. This dating was disputed by [[Hypatius of Ephesus]], who met the monophysite party during the 532 meeting with Emperor [[Justinian I]]; Hypatius denied its authenticity on the ground that none of the Fathers or Councils ever cited or referred to it. Hypatius condemned it along with the Apollinarian texts, distributed during the Nestorian controversy under the names of Pope Julius and Athanasius, which the monophysites entered as evidence supporting their position.<ref>Hathaway, ''Hierarchy and the Definition of Order in the Letters of Pseudo-Dionysius'', p. 13</ref>

The first defense of its authenticity is undertaken by [[John of Scythopolis]], whose commentary, the ''Scholia'' ({{circa|540}}), on the Dionysian Corpus constitutes the first defense of its apostolic dating, wherein he specifically argues that the work is neither Apollinarian nor a forgery, probably in response both to monophysites and Hypatius—although even he, given his unattributed citations of Plotinus in interpreting Dionysius, might have known better.<ref>Rorem, "John of Scythopolis on Apollinarian Christology," p. 482. John of Scythopolis was also proficient identifier of Apollinarian forgeries, giving his defense that much more credibility.</ref> Dionysius' authenticity is criticized later in the century, and defended by [[Theodore of Raithu]]; and by the 7th century, it is taken as demonstrated, affirmed by both [[Maximus the Confessor]] and the [[Lateran Council of 649]]. From that point until the Renaissance, the authorship was less questioned, though [[Thomas Aquinas]],<ref>[[Jean-Yves Lacoste]], ''Encyclopedia of Christian Theology'', 3 vols., vol. 1, p. 439.</ref> [[Peter Abelard]] and [[Nicholas of Cusa]] expressed suspicions about its authenticity; their concerns were generally ignored.{{Sfn|Franke|2007|p=158}}

The Florentine humanist [[Lorenzo Valla]] (d. 1457), in his 1457 commentaries on the [[New Testament]], did much to establish that the author of the ''Corpus Areopagiticum'' could not have been St. Paul's convert, though he was unable to identify the actual historical author. [[William Grocyn]] pursued Valla's lines of textual criticism, and Valla's critical viewpoint of the authorship of the highly influential ''Corpus'' was accepted and publicized by [[Erasmus]] from 1504 onward, for which he was criticized by Catholic theologians. In the [[Leipzig Debate|Leipzig disputation]] with [[Martin Luther]], in 1519, [[Johann Eck]] used the ''Corpus'', specifically the ''Angelic Hierarchy'', as argument for the apostolic origin of [[papal]] supremacy, pressing the Platonist analogy, "as above, so below".

During the 19th century [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|modernist Catholics]] too came generally to accept that the author must have lived after the time of [[Proclus]]. The author became known as 'Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite' only after the philological work of J. Stiglmayr and H. Koch, whose papers, published independently in 1895, demonstrated the thoroughgoing dependence of the ''Corpus'' upon Proclus.{{Sfn|Franke|2007|p=158}} Both showed that Dionysius had used, in his treatise on evil in Chapter 4 of ''The Divine Names'', the ''De malorum subsistentia'' of Proclus.

Dionysius' identity is still disputed. Corrigan and Harrington find pseudo-Dionysius to be most probably...
{{Blockquote|... a pupil of Proclus, perhaps of [[Syria]]n origin, who knew enough of Platonism and the Christian tradition to transform them both. Since Proclus died in 485, and since the first clear citation of Dionysius' works is by [[Severus of Antioch]] between 518 and 528, then we can place Dionysius' authorship between 485 and 518-28.{{refn|group=note|name="Stanford"}}}} Ronald Hathaway provides a table listing most of the major identifications of Dionysius: e.g., [[Ammonius Saccas]], [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria]], [[Peter the Fuller]], Dionysius the Scholastic, [[Severus of Antioch]], [[Sergius of Reshaina]], unnamed Christian followers of everyone from [[Origen]] to [[Basil of Caesarea]], [[Eutyches]] to [[Proclus]].<ref>Hathaway, ''Hierarchy and the Definition of Order in the Letters of Pseudo-Dionysius'', p. 31</ref>

In the past half-century, Alexander Golitzin, [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] academician [[Shalva Nutsubidze]] and [[Demographics of Belgium|Belgian]] professor Ernest Honigmann have all proposed identifying pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite with [[Peter the Iberian]].<ref>Sh. Nutsubidze. "Mystery of Pseudo-Dionys Areopagit (a monograph), Tbilisi, 1942; E. Honigmann, ''Pierre l'Iberian et les ecrits du Pseudo-Denys l'Areopagita''. Bruxelles, 1952; Golitzin, Alexander. ''Et Introibo Ad Altare Dei: The Mystagogy of Dionysius Areopagita, with Special Reference to Its Predecessors in the Eastern Christian Tradition''. (Thessalonika: Patriarchikon Idruma Paterikôn Meletôn, 1994), p. 419.</ref> A more recent identification is with [[Damascius]], the last scholarch of the [[Platonic Academy#Neoplatonic Academy|Neoplatonic Academy of Athens]].<ref>Carlo Maria Mazzucchi, ''Damascio, Autore del Corpus Dionysiacum, e il dialogo Περι Πολιτικης Επιστημης'', Aevum: Rassegna di scienze storiche linguistiche e filologiche, ISSN 0001-9593, Anno 80, Nº 2, 2006, pp. 299-334. Mazzucchi's arguments have been dismissed by Emiliano Fiori in his review of the article, in ''Adamantius'' 14 (2009), pp. 670-673.</ref> There is therefore no current scholarly consensus on the question of pseudo-Dionysius' identification.

The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' claims:
{{quote|It must also be recognized that "forgery" is a modern notion. Like [[Plotinus]] and the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] before him, Dionysius does not claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a tradition.{{refn|group=note|name="Stanford"|"It must also be recognized that "forgery" is a modern notion. Like Plotinus and the Cappadocians before him, Dionysius does not claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a tradition. Adopting the persona of an ancient figure was a long established rhetorical device (known as ''declamatio''), and others in Dionysius' circle also adopted pseudonymous names from the New Testament. Dionysius' works, therefore, are much less a forgery in the modern sense than an acknowledgement of reception and transmission, namely, a kind of coded recognition that the resonances of any sacred undertaking are intertextual, bringing the diachronic structures of time and space together in a synchronic way, and that this theological teaching, at least, is [[dialectical]]ly received from another. Dionysius represents his own teaching as coming from a certain Hierotheus and as being addressed to a certain Timotheus. He seems to conceive of himself, therefore, as an in-between figure, very like a Dionysius the Areopagite, in fact.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite/ Pseudo-Dionysius] in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref>}}}} Others scholars such as [[Bart D. Ehrman]] disagree, see for example [[Forged (book)|''Forged'']]. While pseudo-Dionysius can be seen as a communicator of tradition, he can also be seen as a polemicist, who tried to alter Neo-Platonic tradition in a novel way for the Christian world that would make notions of complicated Divine Hierarchies more of an emphasis than notions of direct relationship with the figure of Christ as Mediator.<ref>"One might ask why it is necessary [in the Pseudo-Dionysian Corpus] to have an ordered hierarchy of angels at all in the Christian tradition, considering that the Bible has no concept of celestial hierarchy. ... That it was found necessary to invent a system of this nature [in the Pseudo-Dionysisn Corpus]  after 500&nbsp;years is tantamount to denying the efficacy of Christ as mediator altogether." Rosemarie A. Arthur. (2011) ''The Pseudo Dionysius as Polemicist: The Development and Purpose of the Angelic Hierarchy in Sixth Century Syria'', pp.&nbsp;63&ndash;64. London: Ashgate.</ref>

A minority of scholars, including Romanian theologian [[Dumitru Staniloae]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Dionysian Authorship of the "Corpus Areopagiticum" According to Fr. Dumitru Staniloae|url = https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2009/10/apostolic-authorship-of-corpus.html|website = johnsanidopoulos.com|access-date = 2023-12-06}}</ref> argue in favor of the Dionysian corpus being authentic, citing internal historical details and the existence of explicit citations of Dionysius predating [[Proclus]] by writers such as [[Dionysius of Alexandria]] and [[Gregory Nazianzus]].<ref>Anthony Pavoni and Evangelos Nikitopoulos, The Life of Saint Dionysius the Areopogite.

==Thought==
Dionysius attributed his inspiration to pseudo-Hierotheus, professing that he was writing to popularize the teachings of his master.<ref>Inge, William Ralph. Christian Mysticism, The Brampton Lectures, London: Methuen, 1899. p 102.</ref> Pseudo-Hierotheus was the author of "The book of Hierotheus on the hidden mysteries of the house of God." Pseudo-Hierotheus is believed to be the fifth century Syrian monk [[Stephen Bar Sudhaile]],<ref>Marsh, Fred Shipley, ed. & trans. Stephanus Bar Sudhaile.

Leiden: Brill, 1886 (Reprinted Eugene, OR: Wipf And Stock, 2010).</ref> a [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] writer.

The works of Dionysius are [[mysticism|mystical]], and show strong [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic influence]]. For example, he uses [[Plotinus]]' well-known analogy of a sculptor cutting away that which does not enhance the desired image, and shows familiarity with [[Proclus]]. He also shows influence from [[Clement of Alexandria]], the [[Cappadocian Fathers]], [[Origen]], and others.

===''Mystical Theology''===
According to pseudo-Dionysius, God is better characterized and approached by [[Apophatic theology|negations]] than by [[Cataphatic theology|affirmations]].{{sfn|Corrigan|Harrington|2014}} All names and theological representations must be negated. According to pseudo-Dionysius, when all names are negated, "divine silence, darkness, and unknowing" will follow.{{sfn|Corrigan|Harrington|2014}}

==Influence==

===Eastern Christianity===
His thought was initially used by [[Miaphysites]] to back up parts of their arguments but his writings were eventually adopted by other church theologians, primarily due to the work of [[John of Scythopolis]] and [[Maximus the Confessor]] in producing an orthodox interpretation.<ref>Rorem, ''Pseudo-Dionysius'', p. 14</ref> Writing a single generation at most after Dionysius, perhaps between 537 and 543,<ref>Paul Rorem and John C. Lamoreaux, ''John of Scythopolis and the Dionysian Corpus: Annotating the Areopagite'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), p. 39.</ref> John of Scythopolis composed an extensive set ({{circa|600}})<ref>Paul Rorem and John C. Lamoreaux, ''John of Scythopolis and the Dionysian Corpus: Annotating the Areopagite'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), p. 38.</ref> of ''scholia'' (that is, marginal annotations) to the works of Dionysius.

These were in turn prefaced by a long prologue in which John set out his reasons for commenting on the corpus. All Greek manuscripts of the ''Corpus Areopagiticum ''surviving today stem from an early sixth-century manuscript containing John's ''Scholia ''and ''Prologue'' — so John of Scythopolis had an enormous influence on how Dionysius was read in the Greek-speaking world.<ref>Paul Rorem and John C. Lamoreaux, ''John of Scythopolis and the Dionysian Corpus: Annotating the Areopagite'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), pp. 1-3. Rorem and Lamoreaux produce a translation of about two-thirds of John's ''Prologue'' and ''Scholia'' on pp. 144-263.</ref>

Theologians such as [[John of Damascus]] and [[Germanus I of Constantinople]] also made ample use of Dionysius' writing.

The Dionysian writings and their mystical teaching were universally accepted throughout the East, amongst both Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians. [[Gregory Palamas]], for example, in referring to these writings, calls the author, "an unerring beholder of divine things".

The Corpus is also present in Syriac and Armenian versions, the former of which, by Sergius of Reshaina in the early sixth century, serves as a ''[[terminus ante quem]]'' for the dating of the original Greek.

===Latin Christianity===
{{Catholic philosophy|expanded=Philosophers|expanded2=Ancient}}
The first notice of Dionysius in the West comes from [[Pope Gregory I]], who probably brought a codex of the ''Corpus Areopagitum'' back with him on his return from his mission as papal legate to the Emperor in Constantinople in {{circa|585}}. Gregory refers occasionally in his writings to Dionysius, although Gregory's Greek was probably not adequate to fully engage with Dionysius's work.<ref>Louth, ''Dionysius the Areopagite'', (1987), p. 120.</ref> In the seventh and eighth centuries, Dionysius was not widely known in the West, aside from a few scattered references.

The real influence of Dionysius in the West began with the gift in 827 of a Greek copy of his works by the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Michael II]] to the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian emperor]] [[Louis the Pious]]. King Louis in turn gave the manuscript to the [[Abbey of St. Denis]] near Paris<ref>Jean LeClercq, 'Influence and Noninfluence of Dionysius in the Western Middle Ages', in ''Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works'', trans. Colm Luibheid, (New York: Paulist Press, 1987), pp. 25-33.</ref> where, in about 838, Dionysius' works were translated into Latin for the first time by [[Hilduin of Saint-Denis|Hilduin]], abbot of the monastery. It may well have been Hilduin himself who promoted his work (and his abbey) by developing the legend (which would be widely accepted during subsequent centuries), that [[Saint Denis of Paris|Denis]] was the same person as Dionysius the Areopagite of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 17.34, and that he had traveled to Rome and then was commissioned by the Pope to preach in [[Gaul]], where he was martyred.<ref>{{cite book|title=Roman Martyrology|location=Lutétiæ Parisiórum natális sanctórum Mártyrum Dionysii Areopagítæ Epíscopi, Rústici Presbyteri, et Eleuthérii Diáconi.

About twenty years later, a subsequent Carolingian Emperor, [[Charles the Bald]], requested the Irishman [[John Scotus Eriugena]] to make a fresh translation. He finished this in 862.<ref name="LeClercq-p25-33" /> This translation itself did not widely circulate in subsequent centuries. Moreover, although Eriugena's own works, such as the ''Homily on the Prologue of St John'', show the influence of Dionysian ideas, these works were not widely copied or read in subsequent centuries.<ref name="LeClercq-p25-33" /> The Benedictine monasticism that formed the standard monasticism of the eighth to eleventh centuries, therefore, in general paid little attention to Dionysius.

In the twelfth century, greater use gradually began to be made of Dionysius among various traditions of thought:
* Among Benedictines (especially at the Abbey of Saint-Denis), greater interest began to be shown in Dionysius. For example, one of the monks of Saint Denys, [[John Sarrazin]], wrote a commentary on ''The Celestial Hierarchy'' in 1140, and then in 1165 made a translation of the work.<ref name="LeClercq-p25-33" /> Also, [[Suger]], abbot of Saint-Denis from 1122 to 1151, drew on Dionysian themes to explain how the architecture of his new 'Gothic' abbey church helped raise the soul to God.<ref>Louth, ''Dionysius the Areopagite'' (1987), p. 122, citing E. Panofsky (Edited, translated and annotated) ''Abbot Suger on the Abbey Church of St-Denis and its Art Treasures'' (Princetown, NJ,) 2nd ed. 1979.</ref>
* Among the [[Canons Regular]]. [[Hugh of Saint Victor]] edited two commentaries on ''The Celestial Hierarchy'' between 1125 and 1137, later revising and combining them as one. [[Richard of Saint Victor]] was familiar with Dionysius through Hugh. Through Hugh, others became exposed to Dionysian thought, including [[Thomas Gallus]] and [[Gilbert de la Porrée]].<ref name="LeClercq-p25-33" />
* In the [[Cistercians|Cistercian tradition]], it seems that early writers such as [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[William of St Thierry]] and [[Aelred of Rievaulx]] were not influenced by Dionysian thought. Among second-generation Cistercians, [[Isaac of Stella]] clearly shows the influence of Dionysian ideas.<ref name="LeClercq-p25-33" />
* It is in the Schools, though, that the twelfth-century growth in influence of Dionysius was truly significant. There are few references to Dionysius in scholastic theology during the tenth and eleventh centuries. At the beginning of the twelfth century, though, the masters of the Cathedral school at [[Laon]], especially [[Anselm of Laon]], introduced extracts from John Scotus Eriugena's ''Commentary on St John'' into the ''Sentences'' and the ''Glossa Ordinaria''. In this manner, Dionysian concepts found their way into the writing of [[Peter Lombard]] and others.<ref name="LeClercq-p25-33" />
* Bonaventure uses images and even direct quotations from Dionysius' ''Mystical Theology'' in the last chapter of his famous work ''Itinerarium Mentis in Deum'' (The Soul's Journey into God).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.uml.edu/rinnis/45.304%20God%20and%20Philosophy/ITINERARIUM.pdf|title=Journey of the Mind into God by St Bonaventure of Bagnoregio}}</ref>

During the thirteenth century, the Franciscan [[Robert Grosseteste]] made an important contribution by bringing out between 1240 and 1243 a translation, with commentary, of the Dionysian corpus.<ref name="LeClercq-p25-33" /> Soon after, the Dominican [[Albertus Magnus]] did likewise. The thirteenth-century Parisian corpus provided an important reference point by combining the "Old Translation" of John Scotus Eriugena with the "New Translation" of [[John Sarrazin]], along with glosses and scholia by [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[John of Scythopolis]] and others, as well as the "Extracts" by [[Thomas Gallus]], and several commentaries such as John Scotus Eriugena, John Sarrazin and Hugh of Saint Victor on ''The Celestial Hierarchy''.<ref>Karlfried Froehlich, 'Pseudo-Dionysius and the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century', in ''Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works'', trans. Colm Luibheid, (New York: Paulist Press, 1987), pp. 33-46.</ref> It quickly became common to make reference to Dionysius. [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote an explanation for several works, and cites him over 1700 times.<ref>Doherty, K.F. "St. Thomas and the Pseudo-Dionysian Symbol of Light". In: The New. Scholasticism, 34 (1960), pp. 170-189.</ref> [[Bonaventure]] called him the "prince of mystics".

It was subsequently in the area of [[Christian mysticism|mysticism]] that Dionysius, especially his portrayal of the [[apophatic theology|''via negativa'']], was particularly influential. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries his fundamental themes were hugely influential on thinkers such as [[Marguerite Porete]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Johannes Tauler]], [[John of Ruusbroec]], the author of ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' (who made an expanded [[Middle English]] translation of Dionysius' ''Mystical Theology''), [[Jean Gerson]], [[Nicholas of Cusa]], [[Denis the Carthusian]], [[Julian of Norwich]], [[Hendrik Herp]] and Catherine of Genoa ["The Mystical Element of Religion as Studied in Saint Catherine of Genoa and Her Friends (1908)]. His influence can also be traced in the Spanish [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] thought of the sixteenth century among [[Teresa of Ávila]] and [[John of the Cross]].<ref name="LeClercq-p25-33" />

==Modern appraisal==
In recent decades, interest has increased again in the ''Corpus Areopagiticum'', for three main reasons: because of a recovery of the huge impact of Dionysian thought in later Christian thought, because of an increasing repudiation of older criticisms that Dionysius's thought represented a fundamentally [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] approach to theology, and finally because of interest in parallels between aspects of modern [[Linguistics|linguistic theory]] and Dionysius's reflections on language and [[negative theology]].

[[Andrew Louth]] offers the following modern appraisal of the Areopagite;

{{quote|Dionysius/Denys' vision is remarkable because, on the one hand, his understanding of hierarchy makes possible a rich symbolic system in terms of which we can understand God and the cosmos and our place within it, and, on the other, he finds room within this strictly hierarchical society for an escape from it, beyond it, by transcending symbols and realizing directly one's relationship with God as his creature, the creature of his love. There is space within the Dionysian universe for a multitude of ways of responding to God's love. That spaciousness is worth exploring: and therein, perhaps, lies the enduring value of the vision of Dionysius/Denys the Areopagite.<ref>Andrew Louth ''Dionysius the Areopagite'' 1987. Reissued in 2001 under the title ''Denys the Areopagite.''</ref>}}
