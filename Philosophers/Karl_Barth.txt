Like many Protestant theologians of his generation, Barth was educated in a [[liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] influenced by [[Adolf von Harnack]], [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and others.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://postbarthian.com/2018/04/18/life-karl-barth-early-life-basel-geneva-part-1/ |title=The Life of Karl Barth: Early Life from Basel to Geneva 1886–1913 (Part 1) |last=Houtz |first=Wyatt |work=The PostBarthian |date=18 April 2018 |access-date=23 January 2021 }}</ref> His pastoral career began in the rural [[Switzerland|Swiss]] town of [[Safenwil]], where he was known as the "Red Pastor from Safenwil".<ref name="Houtz">{{cite web |url=https://postbarthian.com/2017/10/03/romans-commentary-red-pastor-safenwil-karl-barths-epistle-romans/ |title=The Romans commentary by the Red Pastor of Safenwil: Karl Barth's Epistle to the Romans |last=Houtz |first=Wyatt |work=The PostBarthian |date=3 October 2017 |access-date=23 February 2019 }}</ref> There he became increasingly disillusioned with the liberal Christianity in which he had been trained.

Barth began to gain substantial worldwide acclaim with the publication in 1921 of the second edition of his commentary, ''The Epistle to the Romans'', in which he openly broke from liberal theology.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://postbarthian.com/2018/04/21/life-karl-barth-red-pastor-safenwil-part-2/ |title=The Life of Karl Barth: Early Life from Basel to Geneva 1886–1913 (Part 2) |last=Houtz |first=Wyatt |work=The PostBarthian |date=18 April 2018 |access-date=23 February 2019 }}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Karl Barth was born on 10 May 1886, in [[Basel]], Switzerland, to Johann Friedrich "Fritz" Barth (1852–1912) and Anna Katharina (Sartorius) Barth (1863–1938).<ref name=PostBarthian>{{cite web |url=https://postbarthian.com/2018/04/18/life-karl-barth-early-life-basel-geneva-part-1/ |title=The Life of Karl Barth: Early Life from Basel to Geneva 1886–1913 (Part 1) |last=Houtz |first=Wyatt |work=The PostBarthian |date=18 April 2018 |access-date=23 February 2019 }}</ref> Karl had two younger brothers, Peter Barth (1888–1940) and Heinrich Barth (1890–1965), and two sisters, Katharina and Gertrude. Fritz Barth was a theology professor and pastor<ref>Gary J. Dorrien, ''The Barthian Revolt in Modern Theology: Theology Without Weapons'', 2000: "Barthian "crisis theology" movement came into being. Karl Barth was the son of a conservative Reformed pastor and theological professor at the University of Berne, Fritz Barth..."{{page needed|date=April 2021}}</ref> and desired for Karl to follow his positive line of Christianity, which clashed with Karl's desire to receive a liberal Protestant education. Karl began his student career at the [[University of Bern]], and then transferred to the [[University of Berlin]] to study under [[Adolf von Harnack]], and then transferred briefly to the [[University of Tübingen]] before finally in Marburg to study under [[Wilhelm Herrmann]] (1846–1922).<ref name=PostBarthian />

From 1911 to 1921, Barth served as a [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] pastor in the village of [[Safenwil]] in the [[cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Aargau]]. In 1913 he married Nelly Hoffmann, a talented violinist. They had a daughter and four sons, two of whom were Biblical scholars and theologians [[Markus Barth|Markus]] (6 October 1915 – 1 July 1994) and {{ill|Christoph Barth|de}} (29 September 1917 – 21 August 1986). Later Karl Barth was professor of theology in [[Göttingen]] (1921–1925), [[Münster]] (1925–1930) and [[Bonn]] (1930–1935), in Germany. While serving at Göttingen he met [[Charlotte von Kirschbaum]], who became his long-time secretary, assistant and lover;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tietz |first1=Christiane |title=Karl Barth: A Life in Conflict |date=25 March 2021 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-191885-8 |url=https://academic.oup.com/book/39435 |language=en}}</ref> she lived in the family home for 37 years and played a large role in the writing of his epic, the ''[[Church Dogmatics]]''.<ref>''Church Dogmatics'', ed.

==Break from liberal theology==

Liberal theology (German: ''moderne Theologie'') was a trend in nineteenth and early twentieth-century Protestant theology to reinterpret traditional beliefs in two ways. First, it adopted an historical-critical approach to the sources of Christianity. Second, it engaged with the questions that science, philosophy and other disciplines raised for the Christian faith.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bowden |first=John |title=Christianity: the Complete Guide, entry 'Liberal theology' |publisher=Continuum |year=2005 |isbn=0-8264-5937-4 |location=London |pages=701 |language=English}}</ref> Barth's striking out on a different theological course from that of his Liberal university teachers [[Adolf von Harnack]] and [[Wilhelm Herrmann]] was due to several significant influences and events. While Pastor at Safenwil, Barth had an influential friendship with neighbouring pastor [[Eduard Thurneysen]]. Troubled that their theological educations had left them ill-equipped to preach God's message effectively, they together engaged in an intensive quest to find a "wholly other" theological foundation than that which [[Schleiermacher]] had proposed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Barth |first=Karl |title=The Theology of Schleiermacher |publisher=William B Eerdmans Publishing Co and T & T Clark |year=1982 |isbn=0-567-09339-5 |location=Grand Rapids and Edinburgh |pages=264 (Concluding Unscientific Postscript on Schleiermacher) |language=English}}</ref>

In August 1914, Barth was dismayed to learn that his venerated teachers including [[Adolf von Harnack]] had signed the "[[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three|Manifesto of the Ninety-Three German Intellectuals to the Civilized World]]".<ref name="1914Manifeſto">[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Manifesto_of_the_Ninety-Three_German_Intellectuals Manifesto of the Ninety-Three German Intellectuals], 1914.</ref> As a result, Barth concluded he could not follow their understanding of the Bible and history any longer.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://postbarthian.com/2018/04/21/life-karl-barth-red-pastor-safenwil-part-2/ |title=The Life of Karl Barth: The Red Pastor of Safenwil 1909–1921 (Part 2)
 |last=Houtz |first=Wyatt |work=The PostBarthian |date=21 April 2018 |access-date=23 February 2019 }}</ref> In 1915, Barth and Thurneysen visited [[Christoph Blumhardt]], Leader of the Bad Boll Christian Community and Social Democratic politician. Their conversation made a deep impression on Barth. He later commented that "Blumhardt always begins with God's presence, power, and purpose,"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Blumhardt |first=Christoph |title=Action in Waiting |publisher=The Plough Publishing House |year=1998 |isbn=0-87486-954-4 |location=Farmington and Robertsbridge |pages='Afterword' by Karl Barth, 219 |language=English}}</ref> which indicates a likely influence in shaping his own theocentric starting-point. Barth also found in Blumhardt's pro-Socialist politics an inspiring encouragement for his own advocacy for the rights and unionization of Safenwil textile workers and alignment with Social Democratic values. These activities, and a public disagreement with a local factory owner, earned him local notoriety as the 'Red Pastor'.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tietz |first=Christiane |title=Karl Barth: A Life in Conflict |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2021 |isbn=978-0-19-885246-9 |location=Oxford |pages=62–66 |language=English}}</ref>

Barth's theological response was to adopt a Dialectical approach in which he deliberately sought to interrupt and destabilize the assumptions of Liberal theology by a method of negation and affirmation. In a lecture delivered in Arau in 1916, Barth argued that "God's righteousness is revealed like a trumpet blast from another world that interrupts one's obligation to nation, and also interrupts the nurturing of religious thoughts and feelings. A 'No' to these assumptions knocks one to the floor, but a 'Yes' to God's righteousness and glory sets one on one's feet again."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Barth |first=Karl |title=The Word of God and Theology |publisher=T&T Clark Continuum |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-567-08227-5 |location=London |pages=4–11 |language=English}}</ref> Although in one sense it is accurate to say that Barth's Dialectical approach sought deliberately to destabilize the assumptions of Liberal theology; in another sense it is important to acknowledge that Barth never totally repudiated the historical-critical approach to the Scriptures. In addition, he continued to engage with the questions that other disciplines raised for the Christian faith, typically responding with a robust theological and Christ-centered approach.

==''The Epistle to the Romans''==
{{Main|The Epistle to the Romans (Barth)}}

Barth first began his commentary ''[[The Epistle to the Romans (Barth book)|The Epistle to the Romans]]'' ({{langx|de|link=no|Der Römerbrief}}) in the summer of 1916 while he was still a pastor in Safenwil, with the first edition appearing in December 1918 (but with a publication date of 1919).<ref name="Houtz"/> On the strength of the first edition of the commentary, Barth was invited to teach at the [[University of Göttingen]]. Barth decided around October 1920 that he was dissatisfied with the first edition and heavily revised it the following eleven months, finishing the second edition around September 1921.<ref name="Houtz"/><ref>Kenneth Oakes, ''Reading Karl Barth: A Companion to Karl Barth's Epistle to the Romans'', Eugene: Cascade, 2011, p. 27.</ref> Particularly in the thoroughly re-written second edition of 1922, Barth argued that the God who is revealed in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus challenges and overthrows any attempt to ally God with human cultures, achievements, or possessions. The book's popularity led to its republication and reprinting in several languages.

==Barmen Declaration==

[[File:DBP 1984 1214 Barmer Theologische Erklärung.jpg|thumb|1984 West German postage stamp commemorating the Barmen Declaration's 50th. anniversary]]
In 1934, as the Protestant Church attempted to come to terms with [[Nazi Germany]], Barth was largely responsible for the writing of the Barmen Declaration ({{lang|de|Barmer Erklärung}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://postbarthian.com/2018/05/21/karl-barth-and-the-barmen-declaration-1934/ |title=Karl Barth and the Barmen Declaration (1934) |last=Houtz |first=Wyatt |work=The PostBarthian |date=4 April 2018 |access-date=23 February 2019 }}</ref> This declaration rejected the influence of [[Nazism]] on German Christianity by arguing that the [[Christian Church|Church]]'s allegiance to the God of Jesus Christ should give it the impetus and resources to resist the influence of other lords, such as the German {{lang|de|Führer}}, [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref name="Allen2012">{{cite book|author=Michael Allen|title=Karl Barth's Church Dogmatics: An Introduction and Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cM5wdswTKWcC&pg=PA5|date=18 December 2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-48994-4|pages=5–}}</ref> Barth mailed this declaration to Hitler personally. This was one of the founding documents of the Confessing Church and Barth was elected a member of its leadership council, the Bruderrat.

He was forced to resign from his professorship at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1935 for refusing to swear an [[oath to Hitler]]. Barth then returned to his native Switzerland, where he assumed a chair in systematic theology at the [[University of Basel]]. In the course of his appointment, he was required to answer a routine question asked of all Swiss civil servants: whether he supported the national defence. His answer was, "Yes, especially on the northern border!"{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The newspaper [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] carried his 1936 criticism of the philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] for his support of the Nazis.<ref>[[Ian Ward (professor)|Ian Ward]] (1992) ''Law, philosophy, and National Socialism''.

[[File:Barth--_Church_Dogmatics.png|thumb|Karl Barth's ''[[Church Dogmatics]]'' in English translation]]
Barth's theology found its most sustained and compelling expression in his five-volume ''magnum opus'', the ''[[Church Dogmatics]]'' ({{lang|de|Kirchliche Dogmatik}}). Widely regarded as an important theological work, the ''Church Dogmatics'' represents the pinnacle of Barth's achievement as a theologian. ''Church Dogmatics'' runs to over six million words and 9,000 pages – one of the longest works of systematic theology ever written.<ref>[http://tandtclark.typepad.com/ttc/church_dogmatics/page/2/ The T & T Clark Blog: Church Dogmatics].

==Later life and death==
[[File:Karl Barth Letters 1961-1968.jpg|thumb|Photo of Barth on the jacket cover of ''Karl Barth Letters'']]
After the end of the [[Second World War]], Barth became an important voice in support both of German penitence and of reconciliation with churches abroad. Together with [[Hans Iwand]], he authored the {{ill|Darmstadt Declaration|de|Darmstädter Wort}} in 1947{{snd}}a more concrete statement of German guilt and responsibility for Nazi Germany and the Second World War than the 1945 [[Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt]]. In it, he made the point that the Church's willingness to side with anti-socialist and conservative forces had led to its susceptibility to Nazi ideology. In the context of the developing [[Cold War]], that controversial statement was rejected by anti-Communists in the West who supported the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] course of re-militarization, as well as by East German dissidents who believed that it did not sufficiently depict the dangers of Communism. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1950.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=17 November 2012}}</ref> In the 1950s, Barth sympathized with the [[peace movement]] and opposed [[West German rearmament]]. Barth was exempted from a regulation that limited the tenure of a professorship at the University of Basel to the year they were 70 years of age, which he would have reached in 1956.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Kuhn |first=Thomas K. |date=2009 |title=Aus der Geschichte der Universität Basel |url=https://schwabe.ch/produkttypen/zeitschriften/basler-zeitschrift-fuer-geschichte-und-altertumskunde/ |access-date=20 April 2023 |website=Basler Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Altertumskunde |publisher=[[Schwabe Verlag]] |pages=55 |language=de}}</ref> 

Barth wrote a 1960 article for ''[[The Christian Century]]'' regarding the "East–West question" in which he denied any inclination toward Eastern communism and stated he did not wish to live under Communism or wish anyone to be forced to do so; he acknowledged a fundamental disagreement with most of those around him, writing: "I do not comprehend how either politics or Christianity require [sic] or even permit such a disinclination to lead to the conclusions which the West has drawn with increasing sharpness in the past 15 years. I regard anticommunism as a matter of principle an evil even greater than communism itself."<ref>Barth, Karl. "No Angels of Darkness and Light", ''The Christian Century'', 20 January 1960, pp. 72 ff.</ref>

In 1962, Barth visited the United States and lectured at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], the [[University of Chicago]], the [[Union Presbyterian Seminary|Union Theological Seminary]] and the [[San Francisco Theological Seminary]]. He was invited to be a guest at the [[Second Vatican Council]]. At the time Barth's health did not permit him to attend.

Barth died on 10 December 1968, at his home in [[Basel]], Switzerland. The evening before his death, he had encouraged his lifelong friend Eduard Thurneysen that he should not be downhearted, "For things are ruled, not just in Moscow or in Washington or in Peking, but things are ruled – even here on earth—entirely from above, from heaven above."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://barth.ptsem.edu/karl-barth/biography|title=Biography {{!}} Center for Barth Studies|website=barth.ptsem.edu|access-date=23 April 2016}}</ref>

==Theology==
Karl Barth's most significant theological work is his summa theology titled the ''[[Church Dogmatics]]'', which contains Barth's doctrine of the word of God, doctrine of God, doctrine of reconciliation and doctrine of redemption. Barth is most well known for reorienting all theological discussion around Jesus.

===Trinitarian focus===
One major objective of Barth is to recover the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] in theology from its putative loss in [[Liberal Christianity|liberalism]].<ref>Braatan, 80–81</ref> His argument follows from the idea that God is the object of God's own self-knowledge, and [[revelation]] in the Bible means the self-unveiling to [[Human nature|humanity]] of the God who cannot be discovered by humanity simply through its own intuition.<ref>Gorringe, 135-36.</ref> God's revelation comes to man 'vertically from above' ({{lang|de|Senkrecht von Oben}}).

===Election===
One of the most influential and controversial features of Barth's Dogmatics was his doctrine of [[Predestination|election]] (''Church Dogmatics'' II/2). Barth's theology entails a rejection of the idea that God chose each person to either be saved or damned based on purposes of the Divine will, and it was impossible to know why God chose some and not others.<ref>Mangina, 76.</ref>

Barth's doctrine of election involves a firm rejection of the notion of an eternal, hidden decree.<ref>Chung, 385-86.</ref> In keeping with his Christo-centric methodology, Barth argues that to ascribe the salvation or damnation of humanity to an abstract absolute decree is to make some part of God more final and definitive than God's saving act in Jesus Christ. God's absolute decree, if one may speak of such a thing, is God's gracious decision to be for humanity in the person of Jesus Christ. Drawing from the earlier Reformed tradition, Barth retains the notion of double predestination but makes Jesus himself the object of both divine election and reprobation simultaneously; Jesus embodies both God's election of humanity and God's rejection of human [[sin]].<ref>Webster (2000), 93–95.</ref> While some regard this revision of the doctrine of election as an improvement<ref>{{cite book|author=Douglas Atchison Campbell|title=The Quest For Paul's Gospel: A Suggested Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7i53QgAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=T & T Clark International|isbn=978-0-567-08332-6|page=42}}</ref> on the [[Augustinian-Calvinism|Augustinian-Calvinist]] doctrine of the predestination of individuals, critics, namely [[Emil Brunner]],<ref name="Brunner, Emil 1950">Brunner, Emil, ''The Christian Doctrine of God: Dogmatics: Volume 1,'' (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1950)</ref> have charged that Barth's view amounts to a soft [[Christian universalism|universalism]], thereby departing from Augustinian-Calvinism.

Barth's doctrine of objective atonement develops as he distances himself from [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s doctrine of the atonement.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mikkelsen|first1=Hans Vium|title=Reconciled Humanity: Karl Barth in Dialogue|date=2010|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, MI|isbn=978-0802863638|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASY7VESBi3wC&q=karl+barth+anselm+atonement&pg=PA5|access-date=19 October 2015}}</ref> In ''[[The Epistle to the Romans (Barth book)|The Epistle to the Romans]]'', Barth endorses Anselm's idea that God who is robbed of his honor must punish those who robbed him. In ''Church Dogmatics'' I/2, Barth advocates divine freedom in the incarnation with the support of Anselm's {{lang|la|[[Cur Deus Homo]]}}. Barth holds that Anselm's doctrine of the atonement preserves both God's freedom and the necessity of Christ's incarnation. The positive endorsement of Anselmian motives in {{lang|la|Cur Deus Homo}} continues in ''Church Dogmatics'' II/1. Barth maintains with Anselm that the sin of humanity cannot be removed by the merciful act of divine forgiveness alone. In ''Church Dogmatics'' IV/1, however, Barth's doctrine of the atonement diverges from that of Anselm.<ref name=bloesch>{{cite book|last1=Bloesch|first1=Donald G.|title=Jesus is Victor!: Karl Barth's Doctrine of Salvation|date=2001|publisher=Wipf and Stock|location=Eugene, OR|isbn=0687202256|pages=43–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqlKAwAAQBAJ&q=karl+barth+anselm+atonement+diverge&pg=PA44|access-date=19 October 2015}}</ref> By over-christologizing the doctrine, Barth completes his formulation of objective atonement. He finalizes the necessity of God's mercy at the place where Anselm firmly establishes the dignity and freedom of the will of God.<ref name=hasel>{{cite journal|last1=Hasel|first1=Frank M.|title=Karl Barth's Church Dogmatics on the Atonement: Some Translational Problems|journal=Andrews University Seminary Studies|date=Autumn 1991|volume=29|issue=3|pages=205–211|url=http://www.andrews.edu/library/car/cardigital/Periodicals/AUSS/1991-3/1991-3-02.pdf|access-date=19 October 2015}}</ref> In Barth's view, God's mercy is identified with God's righteousness in a distinctive way where God's mercy always takes the initiative. The change in Barth's reception of Anselm's doctrine of the atonement is, therefore, alleged to show that Barth's doctrine entails support for universalism.<ref name="Brunner, Emil 1950"/><ref>{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B. Hoon | title= Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Atonement and Universalism | journal= Korea Reformed Journal | year=2014 | volume=32 | url=https://www.academia.edu/10186965 | pages=243–291}}</ref>

===Salvation===
Barth argued that previous perspectives on sin and salvation, influenced by strict [[Calvinist]] thinking, sometimes misled Christians into thinking that [[predestination]] set up humanity such that the vast majority of human beings were foreseen to disobey and reject God, with damnation coming to them as a matter of fate.

Barth's view of salvation is centrally Christological, with his writings stating that in Jesus Christ the reconciliation of all of mankind to God has essentially already taken place and that through Christ man is already elect and justified.

Karl Barth denied that he was a [[Christian universalism|Universalist]]: "I do not believe in universalism, but I do believe in Jesus Christ, reconciler of all".<ref>Busch, Eberhard. Karl Barth: His Life from Letters and Autobiographical Texts. Trans. John Bowden. Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2015. 394. Print. {{Cite web|url=https://postbarthian.com/2016/08/18/karl-barth-rejection-of-universalism/|title=Karl Barth's Rejection of Universalism|date=18 August 2016|website=The PostBarthian|language=en-US|access-date=5 April 2019}}</ref> However, Barth asserted that eternal salvation for everyone, even those that reject God, is a possibility that is not just an open question but should be hoped for by Christians as a matter of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]]; specifically, he wrote, "Even though theological consistency might seem to lead our thoughts and utterances most clearly in this direction, we must not arrogate to ourselves that which can be given and received only as a free gift", just hoping for total reconciliation.<ref name=bauckham/>

Barth, in the words of a later scholar, went a "significant step beyond traditional theology" in that he argued against more conservative strains of Protestant Christianity in which damnation is seen as an absolute certainty for many or most people. To Barth, Christ's [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] is central.<ref name=bauckham>Richard Bauckham, [http://www.theologicalstudies.org.uk/article_universalism_bauckham.html "Universalism: a historical survey"], ''[[Themelios]]'' 4.2 (September 1978): 47–54.</ref>

===Understanding of Mary===
{{Main|Karl Barth's views on Mary}}
Unlike many Protestant theologians, Barth wrote on the topic of [[Mariology]] (the theological study of Mary). Barth's views on the subject agreed with much Catholic dogma but he disagreed with the Catholic veneration of Mary. Aware of the common dogmatic tradition of the early Church, Barth fully accepted the dogma of Mary as the Mother of God, seeing a rejection of that title equivalent to rejecting the doctrine that Christ's human and divine natures are inseparable (contra the Nestorian heresy). Through Mary, Jesus belongs to the human race. Through Jesus, Mary is Mother of God.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Louth|first1=Andrew|title=Mary and the Mystery of the Incarnation: An Essay on the Mother of God in the Theology of Karl Barth|date=1977|publisher=Fairacres|location=Oxford|isbn=0728300737|pages=1–24}}</ref>

=== Criticism by reformed conservatives===
Barth's doctrine of scripture was criticised by reformed theologians such as [[Cornelius Van Til]], Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones and others in the confessional reformed tradition. Chapter VIII of Van Til's, Christianity and Barthianism (1962), critiques Barth's view of revelation and das Wort Gottes ('the Word of God').
