'''Rudolf Karl Bultmann''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʊ|l|t|m|ɑː|n}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bultmann "Bultmann"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA|de|ˈbʊltman|lang}}; 20 August 1884 – 30 July 1976) was a German [[Lutheran theologian]] and professor of the [[New Testament]] at the [[University of Marburg]]. He was one of the major figures of early 20th-century [[biblical studies]]. A prominent critic of [[liberal theology]], Bultmann instead argued for an [[existentialism|existentialist]] interpretation of the New Testament. His [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] approach to the New Testament led him to be a proponent of [[Neo-orthodoxy|dialectical theology]].

Bultmann is known for his belief that the historical analysis of the New Testament is both futile and unnecessary, given that the earliest [[Christian literature]] showed little interest in specific locations.{{sfn|Broadhead|2011|pp=1170–1172}} Bultmann argued that all that matters is the "thatness," not the "whatness" of Jesus,{{efn|For a similar epistemological comparison, see [[haeccity]] and [[quiddity]].}} i.e. only ''that'' Jesus existed, preached, and died by crucifixion matters, not what happened throughout his life.{{sfnm |1a1=Borg |1y=1994 |1p=187 |2a1=Broadhead |2y=2011 |2pp=1170–1172}}

Bultmann relied on [[demythologization]], an approach interpreting the [[mythology|mythological]] elements in the New Testament existentially. Bultmann contended that only faith in the [[kerygma]], or proclamation, of the New Testament was necessary for Christian faith, not any particular facts regarding the [[historical Jesus]].{{sfnm |1a1=Bultmann |1y=1991 |1pp=94–95 |2a1=Cross |2a2=Livingstone |2y=2005 |2p=252}}

==Background==
Bultmann was born on 20 August 1884 in [[Wiefelstede]], [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]], the son of Arthur Kennedy Bultmann, a Lutheran minister.{{sfn|Dennison|2008|pp=7, 14}} He did his ''[[Abitur]]'' at the Altes Gymnasium in the city of [[Oldenburg (city)|Oldenburg]], and studied [[theology]] at [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]]. After three terms Bultmann went to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] for two terms, and finally to [[University of Marburg|Marburg]] for two more terms. He received his degree in 1910{{sfn|Wildman|2018}} from Marburg with a dissertation on the [[Epistles of St Paul]] written under the supervision of [[Johannes Weiss]].{{sfnm |1a1=Porter |1y=2015 |1p=58 |2a1=Watson |2a2=Hauser |2y=1994 |2p=104}} He also studied under [[Hermann Gunkel]] and [[Wilhelm Heitmüller]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=252}} After submitting a [[habilitation]] two years later, he became a lecturer on the [[New Testament]] at Marburg.

Bultmann married Helene Feldmann on 6 August 1917.{{sfn|Dennison|2008|p=101}} The couple had three daughters.{{sfn|Meier|2011|p=3}}<!-- "Seit 1917 war Rudolf Bultmann, mit Helene (1892–1973), geb. Feldmann verheiratet und hatte mit ihr drei Töchter." [From 1917 Rudolf Bultmann was married to Helene née Feldman (1892–1973) and had three daughters with her.] --> Bultmann's wife died in 1973.{{sfn|Dennison|2008|p=101}}

After brief lectureships at [[Breslau]] and [[Giessen]], Bultmann returned to Marburg in 1921 as a full professor, and stayed there until his retirement in 1951. His doctoral students included [[Hans Jonas]],{{sfnm |1a1=Jonas |1y=1982 |1pp=1–2 |2a1=Markschies |2y=2014 |2p=23}} [[Ernst Käsemann]],{{sfn|Zetterholm|2009|p=78}} [[Günther Bornkamm]],{{sfn|Schild|2016|p=89}} [[Helmut Koester]],{{sfn|Busse|2014|p=44}} and [[Ernst Fuchs (theologian)|Ernst Fuchs]]. He also taught [[Hannah Arendt]]. From autumn 1944 until the end of the [[Second World War]] in 1945 he took into his family [[Uta Ranke-Heinemann]], who had fled the bombs and destruction in Essen.

Bultmann became friends with [[Martin Heidegger]] who taught at Marburg for five years. Heidegger's views on [[existentialism]] had an influence on Bultmann's thinking.{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=113}} What arose from this friendship was a "sort of comradery" grounded on an active and open dialogue between Bultmann and Heidegger from 1923 to 1928.{{sfn|Woodson|2018|p=61}} However, Bultmann himself stated that his views could not simply be reduced to thinking in Heideggerian categories, in that "the New Testament is not a doctrine about our nature, about our authentic existence as human beings, but a proclamation of this liberating act of God."{{sfn|Labron|2011|pp=43–44}}

He was critical of [[Nazism]] from the beginning and his career between 1933 and 1941 was marked by a series of struggles with Nazis regarding their influence upon the universities and the Protestant Church. As a Lutheran who held that the Church could not expect the Nazi State to be Christian, he did not directly denounce its [[anti-Semitism]]. But he objected to its claim to have authority over all aspects of German life including the universities and the Protestant church{{sfn|Hammann|2013|loc=kindle 6295}} and believed it was his responsibility to preach that it was unChristian, especially after Heidegger gave his pro-Nazi rectorial address in 1933.{{sfn|Hammann|2013|loc=kindle 6268}} He particularly rejected the [[Aryan paragraph]] that disenfranchised all people racially Jewish from civic organizations and many professions including clergy, entailing defrocking any Christian clergy with Jewish ancestry.{{sfn|Hammann|2013|loc=kindle 6354}} He stated that the Aryan paragraph was "incompatible with the essence of the Christian church",{{sfn|Hammann|2013|loc=kindle 6647}} since the church made no distinction between Jew and Gentile.   He joined the [[Confessing Church]],{{sfn|Kelley|2002|p=155}} a Protestant movement in Nazi Germany that arose in opposition to government-sponsored efforts to unify all Protestant churches into a single pro-Nazi Reich Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/germany|title=Germany|publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]]|access-date=29 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012004817/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/germany|archive-date=12 October 2013|url-status=dead}} See drop-down essay on "Unification, World Wars, and Nazism"</ref>{{sfn | Ericksen | 2012 | p= 28}}

Bultmann received many honors during and after his career, including honorary doctorates from many universities and elections to honorary societies.{{sfn|Hammann|2013|loc=kindle 11731}} In 1974, the Federal Republic granted him the highest level of the Order of Merit.

He died on 30 July 1976 in [[Marburg]].<ref name="Britannica" />

== Theological approaches ==
Bultmann's ''[[History of the Synoptic Tradition]]'' (1921) remains highly influential as a tool for biblical research, even among scholars{{which|date=May 2016}} who reject his analyses of the conventional rhetorical [[pericopes]] (narrative units) which comprise the [[gospel]]s, and the historically-oriented principles of "[[form criticism]]" of which Bultmann was the most influential exponent.

<blockquote>
According to Bultmann's definition, "[t]he aim of form-criticism [''sic''] is to determine the original form of a piece of narrative, a dominical saying or a parable. In the process we learn to distinguish secondary additions and forms, and these in turn lead to important results for the history of the tradition."{{sfn|Mournet|2005|p=56}}
</blockquote>

In 1941 Bultmann applied [[form criticism]]{{efn|"Form criticism" in this instance is a tenet of [[Dialectic#Hegelian dialectic|Hegelian dialectics]] of which Bultmann applied to theology. The dialectic of Form and Content is explained by Hegel using an example of a book: a book's Form (whether or not it was handwritten, or a hardback copy, etc.), can neither determine nor influence its inner Content, yet, at the same time, that Content requires a form to be read.<ref name="hegel">{{cite book |last1=Hegel |first1=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich |editor1-last=Miller |editor1-first=Arthur V. |title=The Science of Logic |date=1969 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin |location=London |page=3 § 989 |url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl444.htm#HL2_447 |access-date=16 April 2019}}</ref>}} to the [[Gospel of John]], in which he distinguished the presence of a lost [[Signs Gospel]] on which John—alone of the evangelists—depended. His monograph, ''Das Evangelium des Johannes'', highly controversial at the time, became{{when|date=May 2016}} a milestone in [[quest for the historical Jesus|research into the historical Jesus]]. The same year his lecture ''[[New Testament and Mythology|New Testament and Mythology: The Problem of Demythologizing the New Testament Message]]'' called on interpreters to [[Demythology|demythologize]] the New Testament; in particular he argued for replacing [[supernatural]] biblical interpretations with temporal and existential categorizations. His argument, in many ways, reflected a hermeneutical adaption of the existentialist thought of his colleague at the time, the philosopher Martin Heidegger - but also the hermeneutic procedures developed by [[Hans Jonas]], a student of [[Heidegger]] and an exile from [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>Sariel, Aviram. "Jonasian Gnosticism." Harvard Theological Review 116.1 (2023): 91-122.</ref> This approach led Bultmann to reject doctrines such as the [[pre-existence of Christ]].{{sfn|Bultmann|2004|p=328}} Bultmann believed his endeavors in this regard would make accessible to modern audiences — already immersed in  science and technology — the significance (or existential quality) of Jesus' teachings. Bultmann thus thought of his endeavor of "demythologizing the New Testament proclamation" as fundamentally an [[evangelical|evangelism]] task, clarifying the ''[[kerygma]]'', or gospel proclamation, by stripping it of elements of the first-century "mythical world picture" that had potential to alienate modern people from Christian faith:
<blockquote>
It is impossible to repristinate a past world picture by sheer resolve, especially a ''mythical'' world picture, now that all of our thinking is irrevocably formed by science. A blind acceptance of New Testament mythology would be simply arbitrariness; to make such acceptance a demand of faith would be to reduce faith to a work.{{sfn|Bultmann|1984|p=3}}
</blockquote>

Bultmann saw theology in existential terms, and maintained that the New Testament was a radical text, worthy of understanding yet questioned in his time because of the prevailing Protestant conviction in a supernatural interpretation. In both the boasting of [[Legalism (theology)|legalists]] "who are faithful to the law" and the boasting of the philosophers "who are proud of their wisdom", Bultmann finds a "basic human attitude" of "highhandedness that tries to bring within our own power even the submission that we know to be our authentic being".{{sfn|Bultmann|1984|p=28}} Standing against all human high-handedness is the New Testament, "which claims that we can in no way free ourselves from our factual fallenness in the world but are freed from it only by an act of God&nbsp;... the salvation occurrence that is realized in Christ."{{sfn|Bultmann|1984|p=26}} Bultmann remained convinced that the narratives of the life of Jesus offered [[theology]] in [[narrative|story]] form, teaching lessons in the familiar language of [[myth]]. They were not to be excluded, but given explanation so they could be understood for today. Bultmann thought faith should become a present-day reality. To Bultmann, the people of the world appeared to be always in disappointment and turmoil. Faith must be a determined vital act of will, not a culling and extolling of "ancient proofs". Bultmann said about salvation and eternity: "As from now on there are only believers and unbelievers, so there are also now only saved and lost, those who have life and those who are in death."{{sfn|Bultmann|1971|p=155}}

{{anchor|Called value into}}{{^|The preceding anchor (was or) is linked to from the Biblical inspiration article}}Bultmann carried [[form criticism]] so far as to call the [[Historical reliability of the Gospels|historical value of the gospels]] into serious question.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=252}} Despite that, Bultmann was an outspoken opponent of the [[Christ myth theory]]. In his book ''Jesus and the Word'', he wrote:<blockquote>"Of course the doubt as to whether Jesus really existed is unfounded and not worth refutation. No sane person can doubt that Jesus stands as founder behind the historical movement whose first distinct stage is represented by the oldest Palestinian community"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bultmann|first=Rudolf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQ8XAAAAIAAJ|title=Jesus and the Word|date=1958|publisher=Scribner|isbn=978-0-684-14390-3|pages=17|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>

Concerning the relationship between body, soul, and Spirit, he affirmed a [[Christian anthropology#One part (Monism)|monistic]] point of view.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/PDF/ejt/27-2_147.pdf|page=154|author=Martine C.L.

== Legacy and criticism ==
Bultmann was an outstanding teacher, and he encouraged independence of mind among his students. The result was two major developments within the “Bultmann school.” In 1954 [[Ernst Käsemann]] raised “the question of the historical Jesus” (i.e., the question of the significance of knowledge of the [[historical Jesus]] for Christian faith), and a number of Bultmann’s pupils developed a position independent of their teacher’s on the matter. Then [[Ernst Fuchs (theologian)|Ernst Fuchs]] and [[Gerhard Ebeling]], building on Bultmann’s existentialist analysis, developed a method of interpreting the New Testament that emphasized the linguistic mode of human existence, giving birth to the so-called [[new hermeneutic]]. Bultmann himself took part in these discussions along with his pupils for as long as his health permitted, later living quietly in [[Marburg]], where he died in 1976.<ref name="Britannica">{{Cite web|title=Rudolf Bultmann {{!}} German theologian|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rudolf-Bultmann|access-date=7 September 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

Posthumously, Bultmann’s approach to the New Testament has been subject to increasing criticism, which has led modern scholars to overcome his theorems.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Longenecker|first1=Bruce W.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzv-oAEACAAJ|title=Beyond Bultmann: Reckoning a New Testament Theology|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal Carl|date=2014|publisher=Baylor University Press|isbn=978-1-4813-0041-4|language=en}}</ref> According to the theologian and historian of Christianity [[Larry Hurtado]], Bultmann  "approached the ancient Christian texts with a theological criterion, a particular formulation of ''justification by faith'', which he used to judge whether the writings were valid or not."<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Longenecker|first1=Bruce W.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzv-oAEACAAJ|title=Beyond Bultmann: Reckoning a New Testament Theology|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal Carl|date=2014|publisher=Baylor University Press|isbn=978-1-4813-0041-4|language=en}}</ref> [[John P.
