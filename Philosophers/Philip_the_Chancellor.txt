{{short description|13th-century French theologian and poet}}
'''Philip the Chancellor''', ([[French language|French]]: Philippe le Chancelier) also known as "Philippus Cancellarius Parisiensis" (Philip, Chancellor of Paris) (''c'' 1160–December 26, 1236) was a French [[theologian]], Latin [[lyric poetry|lyric]] [[poet]], and possibly a [[composer]] as well. He was [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|Chancellor]] of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] starting in 1217 until his death, and was also [[Archdeacon]] of [[Noyon]]. Philip is portrayed as an enemy to the [[Mendicant order]]s becoming prevalent at the time, but this has been greatly exaggerated. He may have even joined the [[Franciscan]] order soon before his death.<ref name="Payne">Thomas B. Payne.

Philip was one of the most prolific [[Medieval poetry|Medieval lyric poets]]. He was the subject of  [[Henri d'Andeli]]'s ''Dit du Chancelier Philippe''. Philip's most influential work was his ''Summa de Bono''.<ref name="Payne"/>

== Biography ==
Philip was born in Paris between 1165 and 1185 to an important Parisian family. He was the illegitimate son of Philippe, Archdeacon of Paris (born in 1125), and was part of a family of powerful clerics. In particular, his uncle, Peter of Nemours, was Bishop of Paris 1208–18 and undoubtedly helped to foster Philip's ecclesiastical career. Philip received his education at the [[University of Paris]], where he became Master of Theology around the year 1206. In 1211 he was already [[Archdeacon]] of [[Noyon]], and in 1217, he became [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|Chancellor]] of Notre-Dame de Paris.

Philip was engaged in many of the conflicts that troubled the Church and the University of Paris in the years following. In 1228, he was defeated by [[William of Auvergne]] in the running for the episcopacy in Paris. Philip retained his chancellorship until his death December 1236. During his academic teaching career, Philip discussed numerous theological questions that are recollected in Douai, ms. 434, and between 1225 and 1228 he wrote his principal work, ''Summa de bono''. He was also the author of the ''Distinctiones super Psalterium'' and some poetic lyrics. Philip may have been a composer as well as a poet, although it is not certain, since many of his works are set to pre-existing tunes. He put text to many of [[Pérotin]]'s works, creating some of the first [[Motet]]s. His poems were available to many composers in the [[Notre-Dame school]], and his works were a moving force within that artistic movement.<ref name="Payne" />

== Works ==
The ''Summa de bono'' is the first full-scale treatment of the doctrine of [[transcendentals]] in the history of [[Western philosophy]], and it had considerable influence on the earliest generation of Parisian masters. Although its structure can be considered quite similar to other well-known texts of the time, such as that of [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''[[Sentences]]'' and William of Auxerre's ''Summa aurea'', as well as the ''Summa Fratris Alexandri'', the argumentation is innovative. Philip's aim is to outline the ontological identity between the One and the Good, using the first translations of [[Aristotle]]'s natural and metaphysical writings, while at the same time following the [[Platonism|Platonic]]-[[Augustinianism|Augustinian]] tradition. Philip proposed an interesting comparison between the [[Good]], [[Being]], and the [[Truth|True]], which became the effective leitmotif of his work. The ''Summa de bono'' is divided in four sections. First, Philip discusses the nature of the Good in general, focusing his attention on the relationship between the highest good and the created goods. Second, he considers the natural good, describing the properties of the [[angel]]s and the [[Human|human beings]]. Third, Philip evaluates what he calls ''bonum in genere''. Finally he focuses his attention on the ''bonum gratiae''. By describing the graces that pertain to human beings, Philip assesses both the [[theological virtues]] ([[faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|hope]], and [[Charity (Christian virtue)|charity]]) and the [[cardinal virtues]] ([[prudence]], [[Justice (virtue)|justice]], [[Courage|fortitude]], and [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]]).
