==Biography==
Ubaldi was graduated in Law and Music, at [[Rome]]. A student of various philosophical and religious traditions, he distinguished himself as a [[Christianity|Christian]] thinker. He had two children, Agnese and Franco, who died during the second world war. A descendant of an afluent family of [[Umbria]], Ubaldi renounced richness to be faithful to the [[gospel]]. First he went to [[Sicily]] to teach English in a secondary school, then, always as a teacher, he went to [[Gubbio]], where he lived for twenty years.

Ubaldi authored 24 books: 12 in Italy and 12 in Brazil. ''The Great Synthesis'' is considered one of his principal works.
