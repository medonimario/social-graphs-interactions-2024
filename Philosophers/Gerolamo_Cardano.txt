Cardano partially invented and described several mechanical devices including the [[combination lock]], the [[gimbal]] consisting of three concentric rings allowing a supported [[compass]] or [[gyroscope]] to rotate freely, and the [[Cardan shaft]] with [[universal joint]]s, which allows the transmission of rotary motion at various angles and is used in vehicles to this day. He made significant contributions to [[hypocycloid]]s - published in ''De proportionibus'', in 1570. The generating circles of these hypocycloids, later named "Cardano circles" or "cardanic circles", were used for the construction of the first high-speed [[Printing press#The Industrial Revolution|printing presses]].<ref>
W.G. Waters, ''Jerome Cardan, a Biographical Study'' (Lawrence and Bullen, London 1898), from [https://archive.org/details/jeromecardanbiog00wateuoft/page/n13 Internet Archive].</ref>

Today, Cardano is well known for his achievements in [[algebra]]. In his 1545 book [[Ars Magna (Cardano book)|''Ars Magna'']] he made the first systematic use of [[negative numbers]] in Europe, published (with attribution) the solutions of other mathematicians for [[cubic equation|cubic]] and [[quartic equation]]s, and acknowledged the existence of [[imaginary number]]s.

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Cardano - De propria vita, 1821 - 698063 F.jpg|thumb|''De propria vita'', 1821]]
Cardano was born on 24 September 1501<ref>{{Cite web|title=Quick Fact on Cardona|url=https://www.uni-due.de/imperia/md/content/didmath/ag_jahnke/leb_ca.pdf|access-date=2 October 2021|website=Universität Duisburg Essen}}</ref> in [[Pavia]], Lombardy, the [[illegitimate]] child of [[Fazio Cardano]], a mathematically gifted [[jurist]], lawyer, and close friend of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. In his autobiography, Cardano wrote that his mother, Chiara Micheri, had taken "various abortive medicines" to terminate the pregnancy; he said: "I was taken by violent means from my mother; I was almost dead." She was in labour for three days.<ref name="Maggi2001">{{cite book|author=Armando Maggi|title=Satan's Rhetoric: A Study of Renaissance Demonology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dF-JHCT9bT0C&pg=PA184|date=1 September 2001|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-50132-1|pages=181–}}</ref> Shortly before his birth, his mother had to move from [[Milan]] to [[Pavia]] to escape the [[Black Death|Plague]]; her three other children died from the disease.

After a depressing childhood, with frequent illnesses, and the rough upbringing by his overbearing father, in 1520, Cardano entered the [[University of Pavia]]. Against the wish of his father, who wanted his son to undertake studies of law, Girolamo felt more attracted to philosophy and science. During the [[Italian War of 1521–1526]], however, the authorities in Pavia were forced to close the university in 1524.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pavia 1525 : the climax of the Italian wars|last=Angus.|first=Konstam|date=1996|publisher=Osprey Military|isbn=1855325047|location=London|oclc=36143257}}</ref> Cardano resumed his studies at the [[University of Padua]], where he graduated with a doctorate in medicine in 1525.<ref name="mactutor">{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Cardan.html|title=Cardan biography|publisher=[[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]|access-date=30 October 2017}}</ref> His eccentric and confrontational style did not earn him many friends and he had a difficult time finding work after he completed his studies. In 1525, Cardano repeatedly applied to the College of Physicians in Milan, but was not admitted owing to his combative reputation and illegitimate birth. However, he was consulted by many members of the College of Physicians, because of his irrefutable intelligence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Cardan.html|title = Girolamo Cardano - Biography}}</ref>

== Early career as a physician ==
Cardano wanted to practice medicine in a large, rich city like [[Milan]], but he was denied a license to practice, so he settled for the town of [[Piove di Sacco]], where he practised without a license. There, he married Lucia Banderini in 1531. Before her death in 1546, they had three children, Giovanni Battista (1534), Chiara (1537) and Aldo Urbano (1543).<ref name="Maggi2001"/> Cardano later wrote that those were the happiest days of his life.

With the help of a few noblemen, Cardano obtained a mathematics teaching position in Milan. Having finally received his medical license, he practised mathematics and medicine simultaneously, treating a few influential patients in the process. Because of this, he became one of the most sought-after doctors in Milan. In fact, by 1536, he was able to quit his teaching position, although he was still interested in mathematics. His notability in the medical field was such that the aristocracy tried to lure him out of Milan. Cardano later wrote that he turned down offers from the kings of Denmark and France, and the Queen of Scotland.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun|title=Math and mathematicians: the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C|date=2003|orig-year=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=60|oclc=41497065|url-access=registration}}</ref>

== Mathematics ==
[[File:Gerolamo Cardano (colour).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of Cardano on display at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, [[University of St Andrews]]]]

Gerolamo Cardano was the first European mathematician to make systematic use of negative numbers.<ref>[[Isaac Asimov]], ''Asimov on Numbers'', published by [[Pocket Books]], a division of [[Simon & Schuster]], 1966, 1977, page 119.</ref> He published with attribution the solution of [[Scipione del Ferro]] to the [[cubic equation]] and the solution of Cardano's student [[Lodovico Ferrari]] to the [[quartic equation]] in his 1545 book ''[[Ars Magna (Cardano book)|Ars Magna]]'', an influential work on algebra. The solution to one particular case of the cubic equation <math>ax^3+bx+c=0</math><ref>{{cite book|last=Burton|first=David|title=The History of Mathematics: An Introduction|edition=7th (2010)|publisher= [[McGraw-Hill]]|location=New York}}</ref> (in modern notation) had been communicated to him in 1539 by [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] (who later claimed that Cardano had sworn not to reveal it, and engaged Cardano in a decade-long dispute) in the form of a poem,<ref>V.J. Katz, ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', 3rd edn. (Boston: Pearson Education, 2009).</ref> but del Ferro's solution predated Tartaglia's.<ref name=":0" /> In his exposition, he acknowledged the existence of what are now called [[imaginary number]]s, although he did not understand their properties, described for the first time by his Italian contemporary [[Rafael Bombelli]]. In ''Opus novum de proportionibus'' he introduced the [[binomial coefficient]]s and the [[binomial theorem]].

Cardano was notoriously short of money and kept himself solvent by being an accomplished gambler and [[chess]] player. His book about games of chance, ''Liber de ludo aleae'' ("Book on Games of Chance"), written around 1564,<ref name="LudoYear">In Chapter 20 of ''Liber de Ludo Aleae'' he describes a personal experience from 1526 and then adds that "thirty-eight years have passed" [elapsis iam annis triginta octo]. This sentence is written by Cardano around 1564, age 63.</ref> but not published until 1663, contains the first systematic treatment of [[probability]],<ref>Katz, ibid., p. 488</ref> as well as a section on effective cheating methods. He used the game of throwing dice to understand the basic concepts of probability. He demonstrated the efficacy of defining [[odds]] as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an [[Event (probability theory)|event]] is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes).<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~pg2113/index_files/Gorroochurn-Some%20Laws.pdf Some laws and problems in classical probability and how Cardano anticipated them Gorrochum, P. ''Chance''magazine 2012]</ref> He was also aware of the multiplication rule for independent events but was not certain about what values should be multiplied.<ref>Katz, ibid., p. 488</ref>

Cardano was a [[music theorist]] who studied music privately in Milan in his youth. He wrote two treatises on music, both of which were titled ''De Musica''. The first was published within his 1663 work ''Hieronymi Cardani Mediolanensis Opera Omnia''. It is of interest to scholars on the history of [[woodwind instruments]] because of its discussion of instruments from that family. The second treatise was published in 1574, and a copy of it is held in the [[Vatican Library]]. The work is valuable for studies in [[harmony]] for its discussion of the use of [[microtones]]. It is also of interest to scholars of [[historically informed performance]] practice for its details on 16th century performance. The later treatise of music ''Della natura de principii et regole musicali'' which has been attributed to Cardano by some, is according to ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' most likely falsely attributed to Cardano and is by another writer. Cardano also dabbled in composing, writing the [[motet]] '' Beati estis'' which is scored for 12 voices and contains four overlapping [[canon (music)|canons]].<ref name="Grove">{{Cite encyclopedia|date= 2001|entry=Cardano, Girolamo [Cardan, Jerome; Cardanus, Hieronymous]|encyclopedia=Grove Music Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.04908|author=Clement A. Miller}}</ref> 

Cardano's work with hypocycloids led him to [[Tusi couple#Later examples|Cardan's Movement]] or Cardan Gear mechanism, in which a pair of gears with the smaller being one-half the size of the larger gear is used to convert rotational motion to linear motion with greater efficiency and precision than a [[Scotch yoke]], for example.<ref>{{cite web|title=How does a Cardan gear mechanism work?|url=http://www.mekanizmalar.com/cardan_gear.html|publisher=Seyhan Ersoy|access-date=1 April 2015}}</ref> He is also credited with the invention of the Cardan suspension or [[gimbal]].

Cardano made several contributions to hydrodynamics and held that [[perpetual motion]] is impossible, except in celestial bodies. He published two encyclopedias of natural science which contain a wide variety of inventions, facts, and occult superstitions. He also introduced the [[Cardan grille]], a cryptographic writing tool, in 1550.

Significantly, in the history of [[education of the deaf]], he said that deaf people were capable of using their minds, argued for the importance of teaching them, and was one of the first to state that deaf people could learn to read and write without learning how to speak first. He was familiar with a report by [[Rudolph Agricola]] about a deaf-mute who had learned to write.

Cardano's medical writings included: a commentary on [[Mundinus]]' anatomy and of [[Galen]]'s medicine, along with the treaties ''Delle cause, dei segni e dei luoghi delle malattie'', ''Picciola terapeutica'', ''Degli abusi dei medici'' and ''Delle orine, libro quattro''.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=David Eugene|last1=Smith|author-link1=David Eugene Smith|title=Medicine and Mathematics in the Sixteenth Century|pmc=7927718|pmid= 33943138|journal=Ann Med Hist.|date=July 1, 1917|volume= 1|issue=2|pages=125–140|oclc=12650954}} (here cited p. 130).</ref>

Cardano has been credited with the invention of the so-called ''[[Cardano's Rings]]'', also called Chinese Rings, but it is very probable that they predate Cardano. The [[universal joint]], sometimes called ''Cardan joint'', was not described by Cardano.

== ''De Subtilitate'' (1550) ==
[[File:Cardano, Girolamo – De subtilitate, 1559 – BEIC 3024364.jpg|thumb|upright|''De subtilitate'', 1559 edition]]

As quoted from [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]'':
<blockquote>
The title of a work of Cardano's, published in 1552, ''De Subtilitate'' (corresponding to what would now be called [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling#Naturphilosophie|transcendental philosophy]]), would lead us to expect, in the chapter on minerals, many far fetched theories characteristic of that age; but when treating of petrified shells, he decided that they clearly indicated the former sojourn of the sea upon the mountains.<ref>[[wikiquote:Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell]], ''[https://archive.org/details/principlesgeolo01unkngoog Principles of Geology]'', 1832, p.29</ref>

== Scotland and Archbishop Hamilton ==
[[File:Leone leoni, medaglia di girolamo cardano.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Medallion portrait of Cardano aged 49 by [[Leone Leoni]] (1509–1590)]]
In 1552 Cardano travelled to Scotland with the Spanish physician William Casanatus, via London,<ref>C. S. Knighton, ''Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, Edward VI'' (London, 1992), p. 241 no. 652.</ref> to treat the [[John Hamilton (archbishop of St Andrews)|Archbishop of St Andrews]] who suffered of a disease that had left him speechless and was thought incurable. The treatment was a success and the diplomat [[Thomas Randolph (diplomat)|Thomas Randolph]] recorded that "merry tales" about Cardano's methods were still current in Edinburgh in 1562.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 592: James Melville, ''Memoirs of his own life'' (Edinburgh, 1833), pp. 21, 73.</ref> Cardano and Casanatus argued over the Archbishop's cure.<ref>Markus Fierz, ''Girolamo Cardano: 1501–1576 Physician, Natural Philosopher Mathematician'' (Birkhäuser Boston, 1983), pp. 8–11.</ref> Cardano wrote that the Archbishop had been short of breath for ten years, and after the cure was effected by his assistant, he was paid 1,400 gold crowns.<ref>Cardanus, Gerolamo, [https://books.google.com/books?id=blA9AAAAcAAJ ''De Propria Vita Liber'' (Amsterdam, 1654), pp. 136-7]</ref>

== Later years and death ==
Two of Cardano's children — Giovanni Battista and Aldo Urbano — came to ignoble ends. Giovanni Battista, Cardano's eldest and favourite son was arrested in 1560 for having poisoned his wife,<ref name=":0" /> after he had discovered that their three children were not his. Giovanni was put to trial and, when Cardano could not pay the restitution demanded by the victim's family, was sentenced to death and [[death penalty|beheaded]]. Gerolamo's other son Aldo Urbano was a gambler, who stole money from his father, and so Cardano disinherited him in 1569.

Cardano moved from Pavia to Bologna, in part because he believed that the decision to execute his son was influenced by Gerolamo's battles with the academic establishment in Pavia, and his colleagues' jealousy at his scientific achievements, and also because he was beset with allegations of sexual impropriety with his students.<ref name="Maggi2001"/> He obtained a position as professor of medicine at the [[University of Bologna]].

Cardano was arrested by the [[Inquisition]] in 1570 after an accusation of heresy by the Inquisitor of Como, who targeted Cardano's ''De rerum varietate'' (1557).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valente|first=Michaela|date=2017|title=Facing the Roman Inquisition: Cardano and Della Porta|journal=Bruniana e Campanelliana|volume=23|issue=2|pages=533–540|doi=10.19272/201704102017}}</ref> The inquisitors complained about Cardano's writings on [[astrology]], especially his claim that self-harming religiously motivated actions of martyrs and heretics were caused by the stars.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Regier|first=Jonathan|date=2019|title=Reading Cardano with the Roman Inquisition: Astrology, Celestial Physics, and the Force of Heresy|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8608904/file/8651154.pdf|journal=Isis|volume=110|issue=4|pages=661–679|doi=10.1086/706783|hdl=1854/LU-8608904|s2cid=201272821}}</ref> In his 1543 book ''De Supplemento Almanach'', a commentary on the astrological work ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' by [[Ptolemy]], Cardano had also published a horoscope of [[Jesus]]. Cardano was imprisoned for several months and lost his professorship in Bologna. He abjured and was freed, probably with help from powerful churchmen in Rome.<ref name=":1" /> All his non-medical works were prohibited and placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]].<ref name=":1" />

He moved to Rome, where he received a lifetime [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] from [[Pope Gregory XIII]] (after first having been rejected by [[Pope Pius V]], who died in 1572) and finished his autobiography. He was accepted into the Royal College of Physicians, and as well as practising medicine he continued his philosophical studies until his death in 1576. {{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

== References in literature and culture==
The seventeenth-century English physician and philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]] possessed the ten volumes of the Lyon 1663 edition of the complete works of Cardan in [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne|his library]].<ref>J.S. Finch (ed.), ''A Facsimile of the 1711 Sales Auction Catalogue of Sir Thomas Browne and his son Edward's Libraries'', with Introduction, notes and index (E.J. Brill: Leiden, 1986).</ref>

Browne critically viewed Cardan as:

<blockquote>
that famous Physician of Milan, a great Enquirer of Truth, but too greedy a Receiver of it. He hath left many excellent Discourses, Medical, Natural, and Astrological; the most suspicious are those two he wrote by admonition in a dream, that is ''De Subtilitate & Varietate Rerum''. Assuredly this learned man hath taken many things upon trust, and although examined some, hath let slip many others. He is of singular use unto a prudent Reader; but unto him that only desireth Hoties,{{efn|plural of “hoti”: Greek ὅτι, “because”}} or to replenish his head with varieties; like many others before related, either in the Original or confirmation, he may become no small occasion of Error.<ref>''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' Bk 1: chapter 8 no. 13</ref>
</blockquote>

[[Richard Hinckley Allen]] tells of an amusing reference made by [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]] in his book ''[[Hudibras]]'':

{{poemquote|
Cardan believ'd great states depend
Upon the tip o'th' Bear's tail's end;
That, as she wisk'd it t'wards the Sun,
Strew'd mighty empires up and down;
Which others say must needs be false,
Because your true bears have no tails.}}

[[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'' portrays a pedantic scholar of the obsolete, Don Ferrante, as a great admirer of Cardano. Significantly, he values him only for his superstitious and astrological writings; his scientific writings are dismissed because they contradict [[Aristotle]], but excused on the ground that the author of the astrological works deserves to be listened to even when he is wrong.

English novelist [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[Abinger Harvest]]'', a 1936 volume of essays, authorial reviews and a play, provides a sympathetic treatment of Cardano in the section titled 'The Past'. Forster believes Cardano was so absorbed in "self-analysis that he often forgot to repent of his bad temper, his stupidity, his licentiousness, and love of revenge" (212).
