'''Sofya Aleksandrovna Yanovskaya''' (also '''Janovskaja'''; {{langx|ru|Софи́я Алекса́ндровна Яно́вская}}; 31 January 1896 – 24 October 1966) was a [[Soviet]] [[mathematician]], [[philosopher]] and [[historian]], specializing in the [[history of mathematics]], [[mathematical logic]], and [[philosophy of mathematics]]. She is best known for her efforts in restoring the research of mathematical logic in the [[Soviet Union]] and publishing and editing the [[Mathematical manuscripts of Karl_Marx|mathematical works]] of [[Karl Marx]].

==Biography==
Yanovskaya was born in [[Pruzhany]], a town near [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], to a [[Jew]]ish family of accountant ''Alexander Neimark''. From 1915 to 1918, she studied in a woman's college in [[Odessa]],<ref>{{MacTutor|id=Janovskaja|title=Sof'ja Aleksandrovna Janovskaja}}</ref> when she became a [[communist]]. She worked as a party official until 1924, when she started teaching at the [[Institute of Red Professors]]. With exception of the war years (1941–1945), she worked at [[Moscow State University]] until retirement.

[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] had noted in his writings that [[Karl Marx]] had written some mathematics. Yanonskaya found Marx<nowiki>'s ''</nowiki>[[Mathematical manuscripts of Karl Marx|Mathematical Manuscripts]]<nowiki>''</nowiki> and she arranged for their first publication in 1933 in Russian.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.emis.de/journals/DMJDMV/xvol-icm/19/Dauben.MAN.html|journal=Documenta Mathematica|title= Extra Vol. ICM III (1998)|pages= 799–809}}</ref> She received her doctoral degree in 1935.  
Her work on Karl Marx's mathematical manuscripts began in 1930s and may have had some influence on the study of [[non-standard analysis]] in [[China]].<ref>J.W. Dauben, [http://www.emis.de/journals/DMJDMV/xvol-icm/19/Dauben.MAN.html ''Marx, Mao and mathematics: the politics of infinitesimals''], Proceedings of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], Vol. III (Berlin, 1998), Doc. Math. 1998, Extra Vol. III, 799-809.</ref>  In the academia she is most remembered now for her work on history and philosophy of mathematics, as well as for her influence on young generation of researchers. She persuaded [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] when he was visiting [[Soviet Union]] in 1935 to give up his idea to relocate to the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>John Moran, [http://www.newleftreview.org/?view=1020 Wittgenstein and Russia], ''New Left Review'' May–June 1972.</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://hardproblem.ru/events/moskovskie-adresa-vitgenshtejna-ili-gde-sobratsya-analiticheskim-filosofam/|title=Московские адреса Витгенштейна, или где собраться аналитическим философам?|date=2016-12-11|newspaper=HardProblem. Московский центр исследований сознания|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref> In 1968 Yanovskaya arranged for a better publication of Marx's work.<ref name=":0" />

She died from [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] in [[Moscow]].
