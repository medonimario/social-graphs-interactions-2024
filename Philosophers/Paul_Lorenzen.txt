'''Paul Lorenzen''' (March 24, 1915 – October 1, 1994) was a German philosopher and mathematician, founder of the Erlangen School (with Wilhelm Kamlah) and inventor of [[game semantics]] (with [[Kuno Lorenz]]).

==Biography==
Lorenzen studied at the [[University of Göttingen]] until he earned his PhD there in 1938 under [[Helmut Hasse]] with a thesis titled ''Zur Abstrakten Begründung der multiplikativen Idealtheorie''. In 1933, he joined the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and the German Nazionalist Studenti Union (NSDStB), while, four years later, he became a member of the [[Nazi Party]].<ref>Stefan Neuwirth: ''[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-65824-3_10 Lorenzen’s Correspondence with Hasse, Krull, and Aubert, Together with Some Relevant Documents.]'' In: Gerhard Heinzmann, Gereon Wolters (ed.): ''Paul Lorenzen – Mathematician and Logician'', Springer 2021, p.&nbsp;244.</ref> In early 1940 he was drafted into the Army.<ref>Stefan Neuwirth: ''Lorenzen’s Correspondence'', 2021, p.&nbsp;245</ref> Through Hasse's mediation, Lorenzen worked with [[Wilhelm Tranow]] from July 1940 to April 1941 on the Bavy's decoding project.<ref>Stefan Neuwirth: ''Lorenzen’s Correspondence'', 2021, p.&nbsp;245.</ref>

In 1939, he became an assistant to [[Wolfgang Krull]] at the [[University of Bonn]], where he officially remained until 1949.<ref name="tobies">Record "Paul Lorenzen" in: Renate Tobies, Biographisches Lexikon in Mathematik promovierter Personen, Rauner Verlag 2006</ref> His main work was on the [[foundations of mathematics]]—[[proof theory]]. He created and modified [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]]. Lorenzen taught at [[Stanford]], the [[University of Texas]], and [[Boston University]] in the USA. He was [[John Locke Lectures|John Locke Lecturer
]] in 1967/1968.

==Theory==
Lorenzen came in 1962 to [[University of Erlangen]] (South Germany) and founded the [[Erlangen School of constructivism|Erlangen School]] of [[epistemological constructivism]] there.

He wrote with Wilhelm Kamlah the famous book ''Logical Propaedeutic'' ("Logische Propädeutik") and worked on [[game semantics]] (''Dialogische Logik'') with [[Kuno Lorenz]]. With [[Peter Janich]] he invented ''protophysics'' of time and space. He developed [[constructive logic]], [[constructive type theory]] and [[constructive analysis]].

Lorenzen's work on calculus ''Differential and Integral'' was dedicated to [[Hermann Weyl]]. Lorenzen used Weyl's technique to develop a [[impredicativity|predicative]] analysis, which can reconstruct [[classical analysis]], without the [[principle of excluded middle]] or the [[axiom of choice]]. He worked also on [[Gerhard Gentzen]]'s [[cut elimination]] to find a way to continue [[Hilbert program#Hilbert.27s program after G.C3.B6del|Hilbert's program after the results of Gödel]].

In the theory of geometry and physics, Lorenzen was influenced by [[Hugo Dingler]]. He followed Dingler in building up geometry and physics out of primitive operations. Lorenzen took an early interpretation of [[Steven Weinberg]] (Gravitation and Cosmology, 1972) for his doubts about geometrical elements of [[general relativity]], believing that [[Maxwell's equations]] are to be modified by general relativity instead.

Lorenzen was also influenced by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]'s [[hermeneutics]], and liked to quote Dilthey's saying that knowledge cannot go behind life. Dilthey's ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' was the description of the setting in ordinary experience in which we construct the abstractions of mathematics and physics.

As [[John Locke Lectures|John Locke Lecturer]] he invented normative logic as a base on [[ethics]] and political argumentation.
