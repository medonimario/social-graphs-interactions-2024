==Single-volume editions==
Two single-volume editions of the encyclopedia have been published, ''The Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', first published in 1999 ({{ISBN|978-0415223645}}), and ''The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', first published in 2005 ({{ISBN|978-0415324953}}). The ''Concise'' version has the same number of entries as the ten-volume set, each entry in the ''Concise'' version being the summary of the topic that precedes each article in the 10-volume work.  The ''Shorter'' version has over 900 articles, each with more in depth coverage than the corresponding entry (if present) in the ''Concise'' encyclopedia.
