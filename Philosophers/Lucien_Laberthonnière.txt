== Biography ==

Laberthonnière was born in [[Chazelet]] October 5, 1860 and died in [[Paris]] October 6, 1932. He was ordained an [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorian priest]] in 1886. He taught philosophy at the [[Collège de Juilly]] from 1887 to 1896. In 1894, he met Maurice Blondel after being impressed with his dissertation ''L'Action''. The two began an intimate correspondence which would later be published by [[Claude Tresmontant]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tresmontant |first1=Claude |title=Maurice Blondel — Lucien Laberthonnière : Correspondance philosophique : Publiée et présentée par Claude Tresmontant |date=1961 |publisher=Editions de Seuil |location=Paris}}</ref>

He was named director of the [[École Massillon]] in 1897 through 1900 and returned to the Collège de Juilly from 1900 to 1903 as director. He was relieved from his pedagogical responsibilities as a result of the anticlerical laws enforced under [[Émile Combes]]. He then moved to an apartment on Rue Las Cases in [[7th arrondissement of Paris]] to focus exclusively on philosophical research and intellectual apostolate.<ref>Ngindu Mushete, ''Le problème de la connaissance religieuse d'après Lucien Laberthonnière'', p.35</ref> Anxious to define his work as [[Christian philosophy]], he opposed "réalisme chrétien et l'idéalisme grec".  In 1905, he founded an association of religious studies and became a titular member of the Société française de philosophie. He served as director of the ''[[Annales de philosophie chrétienne]]'' de 1905 à 1913 and was heavily criticized by diverse theologians. He focused on issues related to the relationship between faith and reason.<ref>[https://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/lucien-laberthonniere/ Universalis : Laberthonnière]</ref> In 1906, his works ''Essais de philosophie religieuse'' and ''Le réalisme chrétien et l'idéalisme grec'' were censured. His attacks on [[Action française]], notably in ''Positivisme et catholicisme'' (1911), brought negative attention from [[integralism|integralists]]. In 1913, the ''Annales'' were placed on the Index of Forbidden Books. Laberthonnière submitted to the ban on publishing but was not banned from preaching. During the [[World War I|First World War]], Laberthonnière was asked by Henri-Louis Chapon, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nice|Bishop of Nice]] to write a doctrinal letter condemning [[Pan-Germanism]]. He served as chaplain to blind soldiers at the [[Quinze-Vingts National Ophthalmology Hospital|Hôpital des Quinze-Vingts]], where he met his friend the Protestant pastor [[Marc Boegner]].

After the war, Laberthonnière participated in many private ecumenical meetings. From the years 1925 to 1927, he wrote the Lent conferences at the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris]]. He died of an illness on October 6, 1932, at the age of 72. His funeral at [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] was held discreetly, to the satisfaction of [[Alfred Baudrillart]] who worried it would have the "character of a demonstration." [[Louis Canet]] oversaw the posthumous publication of his work.

== Thought==

Laberthonnière was influenced by Maurice Blondel and [[Blaise Pascal]]. His work focused on the existential dimension of Christianity contrary to the so-called ''extrinsicism'' of Neo-Scholasticism. He utilized the "method of immanence" treated of skeptically by [[Pope Pius X]] in [[Pascendi Dominici gregis]] and emphasized the interior experience of Christianity against the empirical claims of apologetics.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fox |first1=Gregory |title=The Ideal Which Must Direct Us |url=https://www.todaysamericancatholic.org/2024/07/the-ideal-which-must-direct-us/ |website=Today's American Catholic |access-date=20 July 2024}}</ref>

Laberthonnière was loosely associated with [[Le Sillon]] though he had a poor relationship with [[Marc Sangnier]] and was a public opponent of [[Charles Maurras]] and Action française. He was also critical of [[L'Univers]], perceiving its focus on the papacy as a perversion of Catholicism. While critical of anticlericalism, he called for a greater degree of separation of church and state and was critical of militant Catholic movements.<ref>{{Citation |title=Laberthonnière's separation between politics and Christian faith |date=1982 |work=Nationalism, Positivism and Catholicism: The Politics of Charles Maurras and French Catholics 1890–1914 |pages=163–201 |editor-last=Sutton |editor-first=Michael |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/nationalism-positivism-and-catholicism/laberthonnieres-separation-between-politics-and-christian-faith/5AB4DEFFF7CC7D1605BB40E0BC39F102 |access-date=2024-07-20 |series=Cambridge Studies in the History and Theory of Politics |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/cbo9780511558610.007 |isbn=978-0-521-89340-4}}</ref>
