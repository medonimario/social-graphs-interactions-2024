'''Michael Faraday''' {{post-nominals|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ær|ə|d|eɪ|,_|-|d|i}}; 22 September 1791&nbsp;– 25 August 1867) was an English scientist who contributed to the study of [[electromagnetism]] and [[electrochemistry]]. His main discoveries include the principles underlying [[electromagnetic induction]], [[diamagnetism]] and [[electrolysis]]. Although Faraday received little formal education, as a [[self-made man]], he was one of the most influential scientists in history.<ref name="Rao" /> It was by his research on the [[magnetic field]] around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] carrying a [[direct current]] that Faraday established the concept of the [[electromagnetic field]] in physics. Faraday also established that [[magnetism]] could affect [[Faraday effect|rays of light]] and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena.<ref name="EncBrit">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Faraday, Michael|volume=10|pages=173–175}} the 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.</ref><ref name="IEEUK">{{cite web|url=http://www.theiet.org/resources/library/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm|title=Archives Michael Faraday biography – The IET|website=theiet.org}}</ref> He similarly discovered the principles of electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism, and the [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis|laws of electrolysis]]. His [[invention]]s of [[electric motor|electromagnetic rotary devices]] formed the foundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts that electricity became practical for use in technology.<ref name="Field">{{cite news |title=The Faraday cage: from Victorian experiment to Snowden-era paranoia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/may/22/michael-faraday-lost-better-call-saul-genius |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 May 2017}}</ref>

As a chemist, Faraday discovered [[benzene]], investigated the [[clathrate hydrate]] of chlorine, invented an early form of the [[Bunsen burner]] and the system of [[oxidation number]]s, and popularised terminology such as "[[anode]]", "[[cathode]]", "[[electrode]]" and "[[ion]]". Faraday ultimately became the first and foremost [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]] at the [[Royal Institution]], a lifetime position.

Faraday was an experimentalist who conveyed his ideas in clear and simple language. His mathematical abilities did not extend as far as [[trigonometry]] and were limited to the simplest algebra. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] took the work of Faraday and others and summarised it in a set of equations which is accepted as the basis of all modern theories of electromagnetic phenomena. On Faraday's uses of [[lines of force]], Maxwell wrote that they show Faraday "to have been in reality a mathematician of a very high order – one from whom the mathematicians of the future may derive valuable and fertile methods."<ref name="MaxwellSciPapVol1">{{Cite book|last1=Maxwell|first1=James Clerk|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RaqhIhxqLiwC&pg=PA360|title=The Scientific Papers of James Clerk Maxwell, Vol. II|editor-last=Niven|editor-first=W.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Michael Faraday was born on 22 September 1791 in [[Newington Butts]],<ref name=ODNB/> [[Surrey]], which is now part of the [[London Borough of Southwark]].<ref>For a concise account of Faraday's life including his childhood, see pp. 175–183 of ''[[Every Saturday]]: A Journal of Choice Reading'', Vol III published at Cambridge in 1873 by [[James R. Osgood|Osgood & Co.]]</ref> His family was not well off. His father, James, was a member of the [[Glasite]] sect of Christianity. James Faraday moved his wife, Margaret (née Hastwell),<ref>[[Walter Jerrold|Jerrold, Walter]] (2018). ''Michael Faraday: Man of Science''. Books on Demand. {{ISBN|3734011124}}. p. 11.</ref> and two children to London during the winter of 1790 from [[Outhgill]] in [[Westmorland]], where he had been an apprentice to the village blacksmith.<ref>The implication is that James discovered job opportunities elsewhere through membership of this sect. James joined the London meeting house on 20 February 1791, and moved his family shortly thereafter. See [[#Cantor|Cantor]], pp. 57–58.</ref>  Michael was born in the autumn of the following year, the third of four children. The young Michael Faraday, having only the most basic school education, had to [[Autodidacticism|educate himself]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Answers about Michael Faraday|url=https://www.answers.com/t/michael-faraday|access-date=23 February 2023|website=Answers|language=en}}</ref>

At the age of 14, he became an apprentice to [[George Riebau]], a local bookbinder and bookseller in Blandford Street.<ref>{{openplaque|19}}</ref> During his seven-year apprenticeship Faraday read many books, including [[Isaac Watts]]'s ''The Improvement of the Mind'', and he enthusiastically implemented the principles and suggestions contained therein.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Alice|title=Michael Faraday's Mental Exercises: An Artisan Essay-Circle in Regency London|url=https://archive.org/details/michaelfaradaysm00jenk|url-access=limited|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/michaelfaradaysm00jenk/page/n227 213]|isbn=978-1846311406}}</ref> During this period, Faraday held discussions with his peers in the City Philosophical Society, where he attended lectures about various scientific topics.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=Frank|title=Michael Faraday, The City Philosophical Society and The Society of Arts.|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41378130|url-access=limited|date=1992|issue=5426 |journal=RSA Journal|volume=140 |pages=192–199 |jstor=41378130 }}</ref> He also developed an interest in science, especially in electricity.

[[File:M Faraday Th Phillips oil 1842.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of Faraday in 1842 by [[Thomas Phillips]] ]]
In 1812, at the age of 20 and at the end of his apprenticeship, Faraday attended lectures by the eminent English chemist [[Humphry Davy]] of the [[Royal Institution]] and the [[Royal Society]], and [[John Tatum (scientist)|John Tatum]], founder of the City Philosophical Society. Many of the tickets for these lectures were given to Faraday by [[William Dance]], who was one of the founders of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]]. Faraday subsequently sent Davy a 300-page book based on notes that he had taken during these lectures. Davy's reply was immediate, kind, and favourable. In 1813, when Davy damaged his eyesight in an accident with [[nitrogen trichloride]], he decided to employ Faraday as an assistant. Coincidentally one of the Royal Institution's assistants, John Payne, was sacked and Sir Humphry Davy had been asked to find a replacement; thus he appointed Faraday as Chemical Assistant at the Royal Institution on 1 March 1813.<ref name="EncBrit"/> Very soon, Davy entrusted Faraday with the preparation of nitrogen trichloride samples, and they both were injured in an explosion of this very sensitive substance.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 17</ref>

Faraday married Sarah Barnard (1800–1879) on 12 June 1821.<ref>The register at St. Faith-in-the-Virgin near [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], records 12 June as the date their licence was issued. The witness was Sarah's father, Edward. Their marriage was 16 years prior to the Marriage and Registration Act of 1837. See [[#Cantor|Cantor]], p. 59.</ref> They met through their families at the [[Sandemanian]] church, and he confessed his faith to the Sandemanian congregation the month after they were married. They had no children.<ref name=ODNB>{{cite ODNB|id=9153|title=Faraday, Michael (1791–1867)|orig-year=2004|year=2011|last=James|first=Frank A. J. L.}}</ref> Faraday was a devout Christian; his Sandemanian denomination was an offshoot of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Well after his marriage, he served as [[deacon]] and for two terms as an [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] in the meeting house of his youth. His church was located at Paul's Alley in the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]]. This meeting house relocated in 1862 to [[Barnsbury]] Grove, [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]]; this North London location was where Faraday served the final two years of his second term as elder prior to his resignation from that post.<ref>[[#Cantor|Cantor]], pp. 41–43, 60–64, 277–280.</ref><ref>Paul's Alley was located 10 houses south of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]].

==Scientific achievements==
===Chemistry===
[[File:Ri 2014 - glass making - Faraday.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.80|Equipment used by Faraday to make glass on display at the [[Royal Institution]] in London]]
Faraday's earliest chemical work was as an assistant to [[Humphry Davy]]. Faraday was involved in the study of [[chlorine]]; he discovered two new compounds of chlorine and [[carbon]]:  [[hexachloroethane]] which he made via the chlorination of [[ethylene]] and [[carbon tetrachloride]] from the decomposition of the former. He also conducted the first rough experiments on the diffusion of gases, a phenomenon that was first pointed out by [[John Dalton]]. The physical importance of this phenomenon was more fully revealed by [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] and [[Joseph Loschmidt]]. Faraday succeeded in liquefying several gases, investigated the alloys of steel, and produced several new kinds of glass intended for optical purposes. A specimen of one of these heavy glasses subsequently became historically important; when the glass was placed in a magnetic field Faraday determined the rotation of the plane of polarisation of light. This specimen was also the first substance found to be repelled by the poles of a magnet.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hadfield |first1=Robert Abbott |title=A research on Faraday's 'steel and alloys' |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Faraday invented an early form of what was to become the [[Bunsen burner]], which is still in practical use in science laboratories around the world as a convenient source of heat.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1-link=William B.

Faraday worked extensively in the field of chemistry, discovering chemical substances such as [[benzene]] (which he called bicarburet of hydrogen) and liquefying gases such as chlorine. The liquefying of gases helped to establish that gases are the vapours of liquids possessing a very low boiling point and gave a more solid basis to the concept of molecular aggregation. In 1820 Faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, [[hexachloroethane|C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>]] and [[carbon tetrachloride|CCl<sub>4</sub>]], and published his results the following year.<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Faraday, Michael | title = On two new Compounds of Chlorine and Carbon, and on a new Compound of Iodine, Carbon, and Hydrogen | journal=Philosophical Transactions | year = 1821 | volume = 111| pages = 47–74 | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1821.0007 | s2cid = 186212922 | doi-access =  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last = Faraday | first = Michael | title = Experimental Researches in Chemistry and Physics | publisher=[[Richard Taylor and William Francis]] | year= 1859 | location = London | pages = 33–53| isbn = 978-0-85066-841-4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last = Williams | first = L.

Faraday was the first to report what later came to be called metallic [[nanoparticles]]. In 1847 he discovered that the optical properties of gold [[colloid]]s differed from those of the corresponding bulk metal. This was probably the first reported observation of the effects of [[quantum]] size, and might be considered to be the birth of [[nanoscience]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nanogallery.info/nanogallery/?ipg=126 |title=The Birth of Nanotechnology |access-date=25 July 2007 |year=2006 |publisher=Nanogallery.info |quote=Faraday made some attempt to explain what was causing the vivid coloration in his gold mixtures, saying that known phenomena seemed to indicate that a mere variation in the size of gold particles gave rise to a variety of resultant colors. }}</ref>

===Electricity and magnetism===
Faraday is best known for his work on electricity and magnetism. His first recorded experiment was the construction of a [[voltaic pile]] with seven [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|British halfpenny]] coins, stacked together with seven discs of sheet zinc, and six pieces of paper moistened with salt water.<ref name="First experiment"/> With this pile he passed the [[electric current]] through a solution of [[Magnesium sulfate|sulfate of magnesia]] and succeeded in decomposing the chemical compound (recorded in first letter to Abbott, 12 July 1812).<ref name="First experiment">{{cite book |last1=Mee |first1=Nicholas |title=Higgs Force: The Symmetry-breaking Force that Makes the World an Interesting Place |date=2012 |page=55}}</ref>

In 1821, soon after the Danish physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discovered the phenomenon of [[electromagnetism]], Davy and [[William Hyde Wollaston]] tried, but failed, to design an [[electric motor]].<ref name="IEEUK"/> Faraday, having discussed the problem with the two men, went on to build two devices to produce what he called "electromagnetic rotation". One of these, now known as the [[homopolar motor]], caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] wherein was placed a magnet; the wire would then rotate around the magnet if supplied with current from a chemical battery. These experiments and inventions formed the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology. In his excitement, Faraday published results without acknowledging his work with either Wollaston or Davy. The resulting controversy within the [[Royal Society]] strained his mentor relationship with Davy and may well have contributed to Faraday's assignment to other activities, which consequently prevented his involvement in electromagnetic research for several years.<ref>[[#Hamilton|Hamilton]], pp. 165–171, 183, 187–190.</ref><ref>[[#Cantor|Cantor]], pp. 231–233.</ref>

From his initial discovery in 1821, Faraday continued his laboratory work, exploring electromagnetic properties of materials and developing requisite experience. In 1824, Faraday briefly set up a circuit to study whether a magnetic field could regulate the flow of a current in an adjacent wire, but he found no such relationship.<ref>[[#Thompson|Thompson]], p. 95.</ref> This experiment followed similar work conducted with light and magnets three years earlier that yielded identical results.<ref>[[#Thompson|Thompson]], p. 91.

[[File:Faraday emf experiment.svg|thumb|A diagram of Faraday's iron ring-coil apparatus]]
[[File:Faraday disk generator.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Built in 1831, the [[Faraday disc]] was the first [[electric generator]]. The horseshoe-shaped magnet ''(A)'' created a magnetic field through the disc ''(D)''. When the disc was turned, this induced an electric current radially outward from the centre toward the rim.  The current flowed out through the sliding spring contact ''m'', through the external circuit, and back into the centre of the disc through the axle.]]
Faraday's breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around an iron ring, and found that, upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary current was induced in the other coil.<ref name="IEEUK"/> This phenomenon is now known as [[mutual inductance]].<ref>Van Valkenburgh (1995). ''Basic Electricity''. Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0-7906-1041-8}}. pp.&nbsp;4–91.</ref> The iron ring-coil apparatus is still on display at the Royal Institution. In subsequent experiments, he found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire an electric current flowed in that wire. The current also flowed if the loop was moved over a stationary magnet. His demonstrations established that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field; this relation was modelled mathematically by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] as [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], which subsequently became one of the four [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell equations]], and which have in turn evolved into the generalization known today as [[Field theory (physics)|field theory]].<ref name="Pioneers"/> Faraday would later use the principles he had discovered to construct the electric [[dynamo]], the ancestor of modern power generators and the electric motor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michael Faraday's generator|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/iconic-objects/iconic-objects-list/faraday-generator|publisher=The Royal Institution|date=15 October 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Faraday and Daniell.jpg|thumb|upright|Faraday (right) and [[John Frederic Daniell|John Daniell]] (left), founders of electrochemistry]]
In 1832, he completed a series of experiments aimed at investigating the fundamental nature of electricity; Faraday used "[[Electrostatics|static]]", [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], and "[[Bioelectromagnetism|animal electricity]]" to produce the phenomena of electrostatic attraction, [[electrolysis]], [[Electromagnetism|magnetism]], etc. He concluded that, contrary to the scientific opinion of the time, the divisions between the various "kinds" of electricity were illusory. Faraday instead proposed that only a single "electricity" exists, and the changing values of quantity and intensity (current and voltage) would produce different groups of phenomena.<ref name="IEEUK"/>

Near the end of his career, Faraday proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor.<ref name="Pioneers">{{cite book|title=Lives and Times of Great Pioneers in Chemistry (lavoisier to Sanger)|date=2015|publisher=World Scientific|pages=85, 86}}</ref> This idea was rejected by his fellow scientists, and Faraday did not live to see the eventual acceptance of his proposition by the scientific community. It would be another half a century before electricity was used in technology, with the [[West End theatre|West End]]'s [[Savoy Theatre]], fitted with the [[incandescent light bulb]] developed by Sir [[Joseph Swan]], the first public building in the world to be lit by electricity.<ref>"The Savoy Theatre", ''[[The Times]]'', 3 October 1881. "An interesting experiment was made at a performance of ''Patience'' yesterday afternoon, when the stage was for the first time lit up by the electric light, which has been used in the auditorium ever since the opening of the Savoy Theatre. The success of the new mode of illumination was complete, and its importance for the development of scenic art can scarcely be overrated. The light was perfectly steady throughout the performance, and the effect was pictorially superior to gas, the colours of the dresses – an important element in the "æsthetic" opera – appearing as true and distinct as by daylight. The Swan incandescent lamps were used, the aid of gaslight being entirely dispensed with".</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Savoy is one of the best places to stay in London |url=https://10best.usatoday.com/destinations/uk-england/london/london/hotels/the-savoy-1/ |access-date=6 July 2024 |work=USA Today |quote=The first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity, The Savoy has a history rich in both invention and scandal.}}</ref> As recorded by the [[Royal Institution]], "Faraday invented the generator in 1831 but it took nearly 50 years before all the technology, including Joseph Swan's incandescent filament light bulbs used here, came into common use".<ref>{{cite news |title=A tour of Michael Faraday in London |url=https://www.rigb.org/explore-science/explore/collection/tour-michael-faraday-london |access-date=6 July 2024 |work=[[The Royal Institution]]}}</ref>

===Diamagnetism===
[[File:Faraday with glass bar crop2.jpg|thumb|upright|Faraday holding a type of glass bar he used in 1845 to show magnetism affects light in [[dielectric]] material<ref>{{cite web|title=Detail of an engraving by Henry Adlard, based on earlier photograph by Maull & Polyblank ''ca.'' 1857|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp01529|publisher=[[NPR]]|location=National Portrait Gallery, UK}}</ref>]]
In 1845, Faraday discovered that many materials exhibit a weak repulsion from a magnetic field: an effect he termed [[diamagnetism]].<ref>James, Frank A.J.L (2010). ''Michael Faraday: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-161446-7}}. p. 81.</ref>

Faraday also discovered that the plane of [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of linearly polarised light can be rotated by the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the direction in which the light is moving. This is now termed the [[Faraday effect]].<ref name="Pioneers"/> In Sept 1845 he wrote in his notebook, "I have at last succeeded in ''illuminating a magnetic curve'' or ''[[line of force]]'' and in ''magnetising a [[Ray (optics)|ray of light]]''".<ref>Day, Peter (1999). ''The Philosopher's Tree: A Selection of Michael Faraday's Writings''. CRC Press. {{ISBN|0-7503-0570-3}}. p. 125.</ref>

Later on in his life, in 1862, Faraday used a spectroscope to search for a different alteration of light, the change of spectral lines by an applied magnetic field. The equipment available to him was, however, insufficient for a definite determination of spectral change. [[Pieter Zeeman]] later used an improved apparatus to study the same phenomenon, publishing his results in 1897 and receiving the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for his success. In both his 1897 paper<ref>{{Cite journal| title = The Effect of Magnetisation on the Nature of Light Emitted by a Substance | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]  | year = 1897 | volume = 55 | page = 347 | author=Zeeman, Pieter | doi = 10.1038/055347a0|bibcode = 1897Natur..55..347Z | issue=1424| doi-access = free }}</ref> and his Nobel acceptance speech, Zeeman made reference to Faraday's work.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Pieter Zeeman, Nobel Lecture | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1902/zeeman-lecture.html | access-date =29 May 2008}}</ref>

====Faraday cage====
In his work on static electricity, [[Faraday's ice pail experiment]] demonstrated that the charge resided only on the exterior of a charged conductor, and exterior charge had no influence on anything enclosed within a conductor. This is because the exterior charges redistribute such that the interior fields emanating from them cancel one another. This shielding effect is used in what is now known as a [[Faraday cage]].<ref name="Pioneers"/> In January 1836, Faraday had put a wooden frame, 12&nbsp;ft square, on four glass supports and added paper walls and wire mesh. He then stepped inside and electrified it. When he stepped out of his electrified cage, Faraday had shown that electricity was a force, not an imponderable fluid as was believed at the time.<ref name="Field"/>

==Royal Institution and public service==
[[File:FaradayFatherThames.jpg|thumb|upright|Michael Faraday meets [[Father Thames]], from ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (21 July 1855).]]
Faraday had a long association with the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]]. He was appointed Assistant Superintendent of the House of the Royal Institution in 1821.<ref name=RIBiography>{{cite web|title=Michael Faraday (1791–1867)|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/people/f/michael-faraday|publisher=The Royal Institution|access-date=20 February 2014}}</ref> He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1824.<ref name=ODNB/> In 1825, he became Director of the Laboratory of the Royal Institution.<ref name=RIBiography />  Six years later, in 1833, Faraday became the first [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]] at the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]], a position to which he was appointed for life without the obligation to deliver lectures. His sponsor and mentor was [[John 'Mad Jack' Fuller]], who created the position at the Royal Institution for Faraday.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Roger|title=What's Who?: A Dictionary of Things Named After People and the People They are Named After|date=2009|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|page=74}}</ref>

Beyond his scientific research into areas such as chemistry, electricity, and magnetism at the [[Royal Institution]], Faraday undertook numerous, and often time-consuming, service projects for private enterprise and the British government. This work included investigations of explosions in coal mines, being an [[expert witness]] in court, and along with two engineers from [[Chance Brothers]] {{circa|1853}}, the preparation of high-quality optical glass, which was required by Chance for its lighthouses. In 1846, together with [[Charles Lyell]], he produced a lengthy and detailed report on a serious [[explosion]] in the colliery at [[Haswell, County Durham]], which killed 95 miners.<ref name="Explosions"/> Their report was a meticulous [[forensic investigation]] and indicated that [[coal dust]] contributed to the severity of the explosion.<ref name="Explosions">{{cite news |title=Causes of accidental explosions in the 19th century |url=https://www.rigb.org/blog/2020/february/accidental-explosions |access-date=8 September 2020 |agency=The Royal Institution}}</ref> The first-time explosions had been linked to dust, Faraday gave a demonstration during a lecture on how ventilation could prevent it. The report should have warned coal owners of the hazard of coal dust explosions, but the risk was ignored for over 60 years until the 1913 [[Senghenydd Colliery Disaster]].<ref name="Explosions"/>

[[File:Lighthouse lantern room with Fresnel lens.png|thumb|left|upright|Lighthouse lantern room from mid-1800s]]
As a respected scientist in a nation with strong maritime interests, Faraday spent extensive amounts of time on projects such as the construction and operation of [[lighthouse]]s and protecting the bottoms of ships from [[corrosion]]. His workshop still stands at [[Trinity Buoy Wharf]] above the Chain and Buoy Store, next to London's only lighthouse where he carried out the first experiments in electric lighting for lighthouses.<ref>Smith, Denis (2001). ''London and the Thames Valley''. Thomas Telford; {{ISBN|0-7277-2876-8}}, p. 236.</ref>

Faraday was also active in what would now be called [[environmental science]], or engineering. He investigated industrial pollution at [[Swansea]] and was consulted on air pollution at the [[Royal Mint]]. In July 1855, Faraday wrote a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' on the subject of the foul condition of the [[River Thames]], which resulted in an often-reprinted cartoon in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. (See also [[The Great Stink]]).<ref>Faraday, Michael (9 July 1855). "The State of the Thames", ''The Times''. p. 8.</ref>

Between 1827 and 1860 at the [[Royal Institution]] in London, Faraday gave a series of nineteen [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas lectures]] for young people, a series which continues today. The objective of the lectures was to present science to the general public in the hopes of inspiring them and generating revenue for the Royal Institution. They were notable events on the social calendar among London's gentry. Over the course of several letters to his close friend Benjamin Abbott, Faraday outlined his recommendations on the art of lecturing, writing "a flame should be lighted at the commencement and kept alive with unremitting splendour to the end".<ref>Hirshfeld, Alan (2006). ''The Electric Life of Michael Faraday''. New York: Walker & Company; {{ISBN|0-8027-1470-6}}</ref> His lectures were joyful and juvenile, he delighted in filling soap bubbles with various gasses (in order to determine whether or not they are magnetic), but the lectures were also deeply philosophical. In his lectures he urged his audiences to consider the mechanics of his experiments: "you know very well that ice floats upon water&nbsp;... Why does the ice float?

To discover truth is his sole aim and interest&nbsp;... even if I could be Shakespeare, I think I should still choose to be Faraday."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Huxley |first1=Aldous |title=A Night in Pietramala. In: Along the Road: Notes and Essays of a Tourist |date=1925 |publisher=George H. Doran |location=New York}}</ref> Calling Faraday her "hero", in a speech to the Royal Society, [[Margaret Thatcher]] declared: "The value of his work must be higher than the capitalisation of all the shares on the Stock Exchange!" She borrowed his bust from the Royal Institution and had it placed in the hall of [[10 Downing Street]].<ref name="Field"/>
