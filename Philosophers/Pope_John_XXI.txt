==Early life==
Pedro Julião was born in [[Lisbon]] between 1210 and 1220 to Julião Pais, chancellor of [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]] and [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]],{{sfn|Branco|2001|p=524}} and his wife Mor Mendes. He started his studies at the episcopal school of [[Lisbon Cathedral]] and later joined the [[University of Paris]], although some historians claim that he was educated at [[Montpellier]]. Wherever he studied, he concentrated on [[medicine]], [[theology]], [[logic]], [[physics]], [[metaphysics]], and [[Aristotle]]'s [[dialectic]]. He is traditionally and usually identified with the medical author [[Peter of Spain]], an important figure in the development of logic and [[pharmacology]]. Peter of Spain taught at the [[University of Siena]] in the 1240s and his ''{{lang|la|Summulae Logicales}}'' was used as a university textbook on [[Aristotelian logic]] for the next three centuries. At the court in Lisbon, he was the councilor and spokesman for [[Afonso III of Portugal|King Afonso III]] in church matters. Later, he became [[Prior (ecclesiastical)|prior]] of Guimarães.

He was Archdeacon of Vermoim (Vermuy) in the Archdiocese of Braga.<ref>Conradus Eubel, ''Hierarchia catholica medii aevi'' Tomus I, editio altera (Monasterii 1913), p. 144.</ref> He tried to become [[Patriarch of Lisbon|bishop of Lisbon]] but was defeated. Instead, he became the Master of the school of Lisbon. Peter became the physician of [[Pope Gregory X]] (1271&ndash;1276) early in his reign. In March 1273, he was elected Archbishop of [[Braga]], but did not assume that post; instead, on 3 June 1273, [[Pope Gregory X]] created him [[Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati|Cardinal Bishop of Tusculum (Frascati)]].<ref>Conradus Eubel, ''Hierarchia catholica medii aevi'' Tomus I, editio altera (Monasterii 1913), p. 9.</ref>

==Papacy==
[[File:Luogo del primo sepolcro di vari papi, con resti del monumento di giovanni xxi, 01.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Pope John XXI in [[Viterbo Cathedral]]]]
After the death of [[Pope Adrian V]] on 18 August 1276, Peter was [[Papal election, September 1276|elected pope]] on 8 September.<ref name="McBrien222" /> He was crowned a week later on 20 September. One of John XXI's few acts during his brief reign was the reversal of a decree recently passed at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274); the decree had not only confined cardinals in solitude until they elected a successor pope, but also progressively restricted their supplies of food and wine if their deliberations took too long. Though much of John XXI's brief papacy was dominated by the powerful Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, who succeeded him as [[Pope Nicholas III]], John attempted to launch a [[crusade]] for the [[Holy Land]], pushed for a union with the Eastern church, and did what he could to maintain peace between the Christian nations.

Among his other acts, he excommunicated [[Afonso III of Portugal]] for interfering with episcopal elections and sent legates to [[Kublai Khan]].<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=John XXI (pope)|display=John XXI.|volume=15|page=435|first=Carlton Joseph Huntley|last=Hayes|author-link=Carlton J. H. Hayes}}</ref> He also launched a [[Missionary|mission]] to convert the [[Tatars]], but he died before it could start.<ref>Johann Peter Kirsch (1910). "[[wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Pope John XXI (XX)|Pope John XXI (XX)]]". In ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. '''8.''' New York.</ref>

To secure the necessary quiet for his medical studies, he had an apartment added to the papal palace at [[Viterbo]], to which he could retire when he wished to work undisturbed. On 14 May 1277, while the pope was alone in this apartment, the ceiling collapsed; John was rescued alive from beneath the rubble; however, he died of his serious injuries on 20 May, possibly an early recorded case of [[crush syndrome]].<ref name="DeSanto2021">{{cite journal |last1=De Santo |first1=Natale G |last2=Bisaccia |first2=Carmela |last3=De Santo |first3=Luca S |last4=Cucu |first4=Andrei I |last5=Costea |first5=Claudia F |date=April 2021 |title=John XXI, the Pope Philosopher and Physician-Scientist of Portuguese Origins Died of Crush Syndrome in 1277 |url= |journal=J Relig Health |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=1305–1317 |doi=10.1007/s10943-020-01096-3 |pmid=33141403 |s2cid=226231611 |access-date=}}</ref>

He was buried in the [[Duomo di Viterbo]], where his tomb can still be seen. The original [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] sarcophagus was destroyed during the cathedral's 16th-century refurbishment, and was replaced with a more modest one in stone with the pope's effigy. In the 19th century, the [[João Carlos de Saldanha Oliveira e Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha|Duke of Saldanha]], as Portuguese Ambassador to the Holy See, had the pope's remains transferred to a new sarcophagus sculpted by [[:it:Filippo Gnaccarini|Filippo Gnaccarini]].<ref name="DeSanto2021"/> In 2000, the [[Lisbon]] City Council, led by Mayor [[João Soares (politician)|João Soares]], successfully had a new funeral monument built in [[lioz]] stone, topped by the original stone effigy of the pope, placed in a more condign location in the [[transept]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Mistério em Viterbo |episode-link= |url=https://arquivos.rtp.pt/conteudos/misterio-em-viterbo/ |access-date=13 September 2021 |series=O Lugar da História |series-link= |first=Anabela |last=Saint-Maurice |network=[[RTP2]] |station= |date=19 February 2000 |transcript-url= |quote= |language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=18 April 2005 |title=Dois papas nascidos em Portugal |trans-title=Two popes born in Portugal |url=https://www.dn.pt/arquivo/2005/dois-papas-nascidos-em-portugal-596168.html |language=pt |work=[[Diário de Notícias]] |location= |access-date=13 September 2021}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
After his death, it was rumored that John XXI had actually been a [[necromancer]], a suspicion frequently directed towards the few scholars among medieval popes (see, e.g., [[Pope Sylvester II|Sylvester II]]). It was also said that his death had been an [[act of God]], stopping him from completing a [[heresy|heretical treatise]].<ref>[[Odorico Raynaldi]], ''sub anno'' 1227, no. 19.</ref> Since the works of "Peter of Spain" continued to be studied and appreciated, however, [[Dante Alighieri]] placed "Pietro Spano" in his ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso's]]'' [[Paradiso (Dante)#Fourth Sphere (The Sun: The Wise)|Sphere of the Sun]] with the spirits of other great religious scholars.
