'''Christian Wolff''' (less correctly '''Wolf''',<ref name=EB1911/> {{IPA|de|vɔlf|lang}}; also known as '''Wolfius'''; ennobled as '''Christian [[Freiherr]] von Wolff''' in 1745; 24 January 1679 – 9 April 1754) was a [[German philosophy|German philosopher]]. Wolff is characterized as one of the most eminent German philosophers between [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. His life work spanned almost every scholarly subject of his time, displayed and unfolded according to his demonstrative-[[deductive reasoning|deductive]], mathematical method, which some deem the peak of [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationality]] in Germany.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Corr|first=Charles A.|date=1975|title=Christian Wolff and Leibniz|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708926|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=36|issue=2|pages=241–262|doi=10.2307/2708926|jstor=2708926|issn=0022-5037}}</ref>

Wolff wrote in German as his primary language of scholarly instruction and research, although he did translate his works into [[Latin]] for his transnational European audience.  A founding father of, among other fields, economics and [[public administration]] as academic disciplines,{{Citation needed|reason=These claims need to be justified by reliable sources. |date=May 2020}} he concentrated especially in these fields, giving advice on practical matters to people in government, and stressing the professional nature of university education.{{Citation needed|reason=These claims need to be justified by reliable sources. |date=May 2020}}

==Life==
[[File:Wolff-tablica.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Plaque on building in [[Wrocław]] (''Breslau'') where Wolff was born and lived, 1679–99]]

Wolff was born in [[Breslau]], [[Habsburg Silesia|Silesia]] (now [[Wrocław]], Poland), into a modest family. He studied mathematics and physics at the [[University of Jena]], soon adding philosophy. 

In 1703, he qualified as ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at [[Leipzig University]],<ref>His [[habilitation]] thesis title was ''Philosophia practica universalis, methodo mathematica conscripta'' (''On Universal Practical Philosophy, Composed from the Mathematical Method'').</ref> where he lectured until 1706, when he was called as professor of mathematics and [[natural philosophy]] to the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]]. By this time he had made the acquaintance of [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (the two men engaged in an epistolary correspondence<ref>[http://www.leibniz-translations.com/wolff.htm Leibniz to Christian Wolff (selections) - Leibniz Translations].</ref>), of whose philosophy his own system is a modified version. 

At Halle, Wolff at first restricted himself to mathematics, but on the departure of a colleague, he added physics, and soon included all the main philosophical disciplines.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle = Wolff, Christian|volume=28|page=774|inline=1|first1=Andrew Seth|last1=Pringle-Pattison|author-link1=Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison|author2=Anonymous}}</ref>

However, the claims Wolff advanced on behalf of [[rationalism|philosophical reason]] appeared impious to his theological colleagues. [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] was the headquarters of [[Pietism]], which, after a long struggle against [[Lutheran]] [[dogma]]tism, had assumed the characteristics of a new orthodoxy. Wolff's professed ideal was to base theological truths on mathematically certain evidence. Strife with the Pietists broke out openly in 1721, when Wolff, on the occasion of stepping down as pro-rector, delivered an oration "On the Practical Philosophy of the Chinese" (Eng. tr. 1750), in which he praised the purity of the moral precepts of [[Confucius]], pointing to them as an evidence of the power of human reason to reach moral truth by its own efforts.<ref name=EB1911/>

On 12 July 1723, Wolff held a lecture for students and the magistrates at the end of his term as a rector.<ref name=wolfc>{{cite book|last=Wolff|first=C.|editor=Michael Albrecht|title=Oratio de Sinarum philosophia practica/Rede über die praktische Philosophie der Chinesen |series=Philosophische Bibliothek |publisher=Felix Meiner Verlag |location=Hamburg, Germany |year=1985 |page=XXXIX|language=de}}</ref> Wolff compared, based on books by the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] missionaries [[François Noël (missionary)|François Noël]] (1651–1729) and [[Philippe Couplet]] (1623–1693), Moses, Christ, and Mohammed with Confucius.<ref name=jstor>{{cite journal|journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]] |year=1953 |volume=14 |number=4 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |jstor=2707702 |title=The Sinophilism of Christian Wolf (1679–1754) |last=Lang|first=Donald F.|pages=561–574 |doi=10.2307/2707702 }}</ref> 

According to [[Voltaire]], Prof. [[August Hermann Francke]] had been teaching in an empty classroom but Wolff attracted with his lectures around 1,000 students from all over.<ref name=rathaus>{{cite web|url=http://www.rathausseite.de/default.asp?id=l2&b=09|title=Auditorium Maximum der Universität Halle|publisher=Rathausseite|access-date=1 January 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130211184843/http://www.rathausseite.de/default.asp?id=l2&b=09|archive-date=11 February 2013|language=de}}</ref> 

In the follow-up, Wolff was accused by Francke of [[fatalism]] and atheism,<ref name=uhalley>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEZI_ULqp7EC |last=Uhalley |first=Stephen |author2=Xiaoxin Wu |title=China and Christianity.

His successors were [[Joachim Lange]], a pietist, and his son, who had gained the ear of the king [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia|Frederick William I]]. (They claimed to the king if Wolff's determinism were recognized, no soldier who deserted could be punished as he would have acted only as it was necessarily predetermined that he should, which so enraged the king that he immediately deprived Wolff of his office, and ordered Wolff to leave Prussian territory within 48 hours or be hanged.)<ref name=EB1911/>

The same day, Wolff passed into Saxony, and presently proceeded to [[Marburg]], [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], to whose university (the [[University of Marburg]]) he had received a call even before this crisis, which was now renewed. The [[Landgrave]] of Hesse received him with every mark of distinction, and the circumstances of his expulsion drew universal attention to his philosophy. It was everywhere discussed, and over two hundred books and pamphlets appeared for or against it before 1737, not reckoning the systematic treatises of Wolff and his followers.<ref name=EB1911/>

According to [[Jonathan I. Israel]], "the conflict became one of the most significant cultural confrontations of the 18th century and perhaps the most important of the Enlightenment in Central Europe and the Baltic countries before the French Revolution."<ref name=Israel>{{cite book|last=Israel|first=Jonathan I.|title=Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|chapter=29|isbn=0-19925456-7}}<!--|access-date=1 January 2012--></ref>

Prussian crown prince Frederick defended Wolff against [[Joachim Lange]] and ordered the Berlin minister Jean Deschamps, a former pupil of Wolff, to translate ''Vernünftige Gedanken von Gott, der Welt und der Seele des Menschen, auch allen Dingen überhaupt'' into French.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Sciences of the Soul.

His entry into the town on 6 December 1740 took on the character of a triumphal procession. In 1743, he became chancellor of the university, and in 1745, he received the title of ''Freiherr'' ([[Baron]]) from the Elector of [[Bavaria]], possibly the first scholar to have been created hereditary Baron of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the basis of his academic work.{{cn|date=October 2021}} 

When Wolff died on 9 April 1754, he was a very wealthy man, owing almost entirely to his income from lecture-fees, salaries, and royalties.  He was also a member of many academies. His school, the Wolffians, was the first school in the philosophical sense to be associated with a German philosopher. It dominated Germany until the rise of [[Immanuel Kant|Kantianism]].{{cn|date=October 2021}}

Wolff was married and had several children.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wolff |first=Christian |title=Eigene Lebensbeschreibung |year=1841 |publisher=Leipzig |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_TM8uAAAAYAAJ/page/n174/mode/1up}}</ref>

==Philosophical work<!--'General metaphysics' and 'Special metaphysics' redirect here-->==
Wolffian philosophy has a marked insistence everywhere on a clear and methodic exposition, holding confidence in the power of reason to reduce all subjects to this form. He was distinguished for writing copies in both Latin and German. Through his influence, [[natural law]] and philosophy were taught at most German universities, in particular those located in the Protestant principalities. Wolff personally expedited their introduction inside Hesse-Cassel.<ref>[[#ingrao|Ingrao, 1982]], p. 955</ref>

The Wolffian system retains the [[determinism]] and optimism of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], but the [[monadology]] recedes into the background, the monads falling asunder into souls or conscious beings on the one hand and mere atoms on the other. The doctrine of the pre-established harmony also loses its [[metaphysical]] significance (while remaining an important [[heuristic]] device), and the [[principle of sufficient reason]] is once more discarded in favor of the [[principle of contradiction]] which Wolff seeks to make the fundamental principle of philosophy.<ref name=EB1911/>

Wolff had philosophy divided into a theoretical and a practical part. Logic, sometimes called ''philosophia rationalis'', forms the introduction or [[propaedeutics]] to both.<ref name=EB1911/>

In the "Preface" of the 2nd edition of Kant's book, Wolff is defined as "the greatest of all dogmatic philosophers."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Matt |last=Hettche |title=Christian Wolff |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/ |encyclopedia=SEP |date=11 November 2014 |access-date=24 March 2018}}</ref> Wolff was read by [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s father, Michael Pedersen.

Wolff saw ontology as a [[deductive]] science, knowable [[a priori]] and based on two fundamental principles: the [[principle of non-contradiction]] ("it cannot happen that the same thing is and is not") and the [[principle of sufficient reason]] ("nothing exists without a sufficient reason for why it exists rather than does not exist").<ref name="Craig">{{cite book |last1=Craig |first1=Edward |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=1996 |publisher=Routledge |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BEAREO |chapter=Wolff, Christian}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sandkühler |first1=Hans Jörg |title=Enzyklopädie Philosophie |date=2010 |publisher=Meiner |url=https://meiner.de/enzyklopadie-philosophie.html |chapter=Ontologie |access-date=16 December 2020 |archive-date=11 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210311040207/https://meiner.de/enzyklopadie-philosophie.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Beings'' are defined by their ''determinations'' or ''predicates'', which can't involve a contradiction. Determinates come in 3 types: ''essentialia'', ''attributes'', and ''modes''.<ref name="Craig"/> ''Essentialia'' define the nature of a being and are therefore necessary properties of this being. ''Attributes'' are determinations that follow from essentialia and are equally necessary, in contrast to ''modes'', which are merely contingent. Wolff conceives ''existence'' as just one determination among others, which a being may lack.<ref name="Hettche">{{cite web |last1=Hettche |first1=Matt |last2=Dyck |first2=Corey |title=Christian Wolff |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=16 December 2020 |date=2019}}</ref> Ontology is interested in being at large, not just in actual being.

Wolff refers to this as a "reason of being" and contrasts it with a "reason of becoming", which explains why some things have actual existence.<ref name="Hettche"/>

Practical philosophy is subdivided into ethics, economics and politics. Wolff's moral principle is the realization of human perfection<ref name=EB1911/>{{mdash}}seen realistically as the kind of perfection the human person actually can achieve in the world in which we live. It is perhaps the combination of Enlightenment optimism and worldly realism that made Wolff so successful and popular as a teacher of future statesmen and business leaders.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Matt |last=Hettche |title=Christian Wolff. 9.
