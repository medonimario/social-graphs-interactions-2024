He is recognized as the founder of the "[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|neo-Leibnizian]]" movement in Russia, which involved updating the ideas of philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, as well as the works of [[Hermann Lotze|R.H. Lotze]] and [[Gustav Teichmüller]]. Kozlov's philosophy is also considered a precursor to Russian [[Personalism|personalist]] [[metaphysics]].<ref name="Routledge">Poole, R. (2002).

== Biography ==

Aleksei Kozlov was born in 1831 in [[Moscow]]. Initially, he studied physics and mathematics, but later obtained a degree in literature in 1854.<ref name="DPR">Avdeïeva, L.R. (2010). "Alexeï Kozlov". In F. Lesourd (dir.). ''Dictionnaire de la philosophie russe'' (1995, 2007). Lausanne: L'Âge d'Homme. pp. 456–459.</ref> Kozlov was drawn to the ideas of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Charles Fourier]], which led him to develop [[Socialism|socialist]] views.<ref name="Enc"/> His beliefs resulted in a brief prison term in 1866 and the loss of his teaching position at a Moscow secondary school.<ref name="Enc"/>

Kozlov delved into philosophy in the 1870s, influenced successively by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Eduard von Hartmann]], and [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref name="Enc"/> He became a professor of philosophy at [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv|Kyiv University]] in 1876, where he founded the first Russian philosophical journal, ''Filosofskii trekhmesiachnik'' (''Philosophical Quarterly'').<ref name="Enc"/> During this time, he developed his own mature position under the influence of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and his followers, such as [[Hermann Lotze]] and [[Gustav Teichmüller]].<ref name="Enc"/>

After retiring due to illness in 1887, Kozlov moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] and published his views systematically in a private journal called ''Svoe slovo'' (''A Personal Wor''), which was occasionally published from 1888 to 1898.<ref name="Enc"/> He died in Saint Petersburg in the spring of 1901.

== Philosophy ==

Kozlov was an advocate for a [[Panpsychism|panpsychist]] [[metaphysics]] and developed a form of monadology, in which [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]s were capable of essential interaction, unlike [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s theory of [[pre-established harmony]].<ref name="DS">Skrbina, D. (2005). ''Panpsychism in the West''. Cambridge (Massachusetts)/London: MIT Press, p.168.</ref> Kozlov conceptualized these monads as spiritual and conscious, serving as the basis for all reality.<ref name="DS"/> They formed a closed totality grounded in a Supreme Substance, God, within which each monad was connected to the others.<ref name="Enc"/>

Kozlov viewed the human body as a collection of less conscious spiritual substances, which the [[Self|ego]] interacted with until death.<ref name="Enc"/> He suggested that after death, the ego is reincarnated through the interaction with other spiritual substances to form a new body.<ref name="Enc"/>

The Russian philosopher [[Nikolay Lossky]] was highly influenced by Kozlov's ideas, and in a 1901 article entitled "Kozlov: His Panpsychism", Lossky expounded upon Kozlov's system.<ref name="DS"/>
