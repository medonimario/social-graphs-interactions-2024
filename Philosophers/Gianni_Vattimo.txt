Gianteresio Vattimo was born in [[Turin]], [[Piedmont]]. He studied [[philosophy]] under the [[existentialism|existentialist]] [[Luigi Pareyson]] at the [[University of Turin]], and graduated with a [[laurea]] in 1959. In 1963 he moved to [[Heidelberg]] and studied with [[Karl Löwith]], Habermas and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] with a scholarship from the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Gianni Gattino|url=https://www.lastampa.it/cultura/2010/08/23/news/sul-sentiero-dei-filosofi-br-due-virgole-cambiano-tutto-1.37004551/amp/|title=Sul sentiero dei filosofi due righe cambiano tutto|language=Italian|journal=La Stampa|date=July 13, 2019|access-date=June 21, 2021}}</ref> Then, Vattimo returned to Turin where he became assistant professor in 1964, and later full professor of [[Aesthetics]] in 1969. While remaining at Turin, becoming Professor of Theoretical Philosophy in 1982, he had been a visiting professor at a number of American Universities.

For his works, he received [[honorary degrees]] from the universities of [[National University of La Plata|La Plata]], [[Palermo]], [[Complutense University of Madrid|Madrid]], [[Havana]], and San Marcos of Lima.

Vattimo said he was exempted from military service.<ref name="haaretz.com">[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.606698 Well-known Italian philosopher:'I’d like to shoot those bastard Zionists']</ref>

After being active in the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]], the short-lived ''Alleanza per Torino'', and the [[Democrats of the Left]], Vattimo joined the [[Party of Italian Communists]]. He was elected a [[MEPs for Italy 1999-2004|member of the European Parliament]] first in 1999 and for a second mandate in 2009.

Vattimo was openly gay.<ref name=sobriquet>{{cite web |title="Mellow Nihilism": A Review of Gianni Vattimo's Nihilism and Emancipation |author=Robert Savino Oventile |url=https://books.sobriquetmagazine.com/2006/09/mellow-nihilism.html |work=[[Sobriquet Magazine]] |date=23 September 2006 |access-date=2007-07-17}}</ref> 

In 2010, he delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]] on ''The End of Reality'' at the [[University of Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Glasgow Gifford Lectures |url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/events/lectures/gifford/ |website=gla.ac.uk |publisher=University of Glasgow}}</ref> In the same year he participated in the [[Subversive Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|author=M.

==Philosophy==
Vattimo's philosophy can be characterized as [[postmodern]] with his emphasis on "pensiero debole" (weak thought). This requires that the foundational certainties of [[modernity]] with its emphasis on [[objective truth]] founded in a [[rational]] unitary subject be relinquished for a more multi-faceted conception closer to that of [[the arts]]. He draws on the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]] with his critique of foundations and the [[hermeneutic]] philosophy of his teacher [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]. Perhaps his greatest influence though is the thought of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], whose "discovery of the 'lie', the discovery that alleged '[[values]]' and [[metaphysical]] structures are just a play of forces" (1993:93), plays an important role in Vattimo's notion of "weak thought".

Vattimo embraced [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s [[nihilist]] idea of [[God is dead|God's death]].<ref name="sobriquet" /> Vattimo rejected any notion of a [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] structure of [[reason]] or [[reality]] that would be given once and for all. This does not imply the loss of [[truth]], but a Heideggerean reinterpretation of truth as the opening of horizons. Such truth is deeper than [[proposition]]s which are made possible by such openings. Philosophies then are always responses to [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] questions, they are '[[Ontology|ontologies]] of [[Potentiality and actuality|actuality]],' a thesis that can be confirmed by the [[Cultural history|historico-cultural]] links of particular philosophies. For [[hermeneutics]] to be consistent with its own [[Metaphysics#Rejections of metaphysics|rejection of metaphysics]], it must present itself, argues Vattimo "as the most persuasive philosophical interpretation of a situation or '[[epoch]]'" (1997:10). To do this, Vattimo proposed a reading of hermeneutics as having a "nihilistic" vocation.<ref>Matthias Riedl. {{cite journal |title=The Permanence of the Eschatological: Reflections on Gianni Vattimo's Hermeneutic Age|journal=Discursing the Post-Secular |url=https://www.academia.edu/3858166 |last1=Riedl |first1=Matthias |date=January 2010 }} in ''Discoursing the Post-Secular: Essays on the Habermasian Post-Secular Turn''. Edited by Péter Losonczi and Aakash Singh. LIT: Münster 2010, pp. 111-126.</ref>

To Vattimo, hermeneutics has become boring and vague, lacking any clear significance for philosophical problems. His answer was to insist on the nihilistic consequences of hermeneutics. The claim that "there are no facts only interpretations and this too is an interpretation" amounts to saying that hermeneutics cannot be seen as the most accurate/true description of the permanent structures of the reality of [[Human condition|human existence]]. Hermeneutics is not a metaphysical theory in this sense and so can only be "proved" by being presented as the response to a history of being, a history of the fabling of the world, of the weakening of structures, that is as the occurrence of nihilism.

This nihilistic reading of history involves a certain attitude towards [[modernity]], whereby modernity is dissolved from within through a twisting, distorting radicalisation of its premises. Vattimo uses Heidegger's term ''Verwindung'' to capture this post-modern recovery from modernity.

History as a process of weakening (secularisation and disenchantment are other terms Vattimo uses) "assumes the form of a decision for non-violence" (1992:95). An [[ethics]] of communication along the lines suggested by [[Jürgen Habermas]] suffers, according to Vattimo, from finding itself in a substantially ahistorical position, while oscillating between [[formalism (philosophy)|formalism]] and cultural [[relativism]] (1992:117). For Vattimo it is only when hermeneutics accepts its nihilistic destiny that "it can find in 'negativity,' in dissolution as the 'destiny of [[Being]]' ... the orientating principle that enables it to realize its own original inclination for ethics whilst neither restoring metaphysics nor surrendering to the futility of a relativistic philosophy of culture" (1992:119).

In 2004, after leaving the party of the Democrats of the Left, he endorsed [[Marxism]], reassessing positively its projection principles and wishing for a "return" to the thought of the [[Trier]] philosopher and to a [[communism]], rid of distorted Soviet developments, which have to be [[dialectic]]ally overcome. Vattimo asserted the continuity of his new choices with the "weak thought," thus having changed "many of his ideas." He namely referred to a "weakened Marx,"<ref>Gianni Vattimo. ''Ecce comu. Come si ri-diventa ciò che si era''. Fazi. Rome, 2007</ref> as an ideological basis capable of showing the real nature of communism. The new Marxist approach, therefore, emerged as a practical development of the "weak thought" into the frame of a political perspective. His next political book, co-authored with Santiago Zabala, is ''Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx'' (2011).

The authors explain the book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism]]'' as follows: "Although the material published here had never been released before, there are two books that have determined the production of this text: Gianni's ''Ecce Comu: Come si diventa cio che si era'' (2007) and Santiago's ''The Remains of Being: [[hermeneutic ontology|Hermeneutic Ontology]] After Metaphysics'' (2009). In the former, Vattimo emphasized the political necessity of reevaluating [[communism]]; in the latter, Zabala insisted on the progressive nature of [[hermeneutics]]. ''Hermeneutic Communism'' can be considered a radical development of both."<ref>Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala. ''Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx'' Columbia University Press. 2011. Pg. VII</ref>

==Views and opinions==

==={{anchor|Support for Hamas}}Palestine and Israel===
Vattimo added his name to a petition released on 28 February 2009, calling on the [[European Union]] to remove [[Hamas]] from its list of terrorist organizations and grant it full recognition as a legitimate voice of the [[Palestinian people]].

On 22 July 2014, in response to the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] [[Operation Protective Edge|military operation on Gaza]], Vattimo said he would personally like to "shoot those bastard Zionists" and thinks Europeans should raise money "to buy Hamas some more rockets".<ref name="haaretz.com"/> He expressed his willingness to go to Gaza and fight side by side with [[Hamas]] and asserted, when asked if he would shoot at Israelis, that: 'By nature I'm non-violent, but I'd shoot at those (of them) who bomb  hospitals, private clinics and children.' Vattimo added that for him these were 'pure Nazis', the state itself a Nazi state (uno stato nazista) perhaps somewhat worse even than Hitler because, in Israel's case, they have the support of the great Western democracies.<ref>Gisella Ruccia, [http://tv.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2014/07/16/vattimo-israele-nazisti-puri-forse-peggio-di-hitler-e-volano-insulti-con-parenzo/288906/ 'Israele?

====Accusations of anti-Semitism====
Vattimo had been accused of [[anti-Semitism]] due to his [[anti-Zionism]]. [[Renzo Gattegna]], the president of the [[Union of Italian Jewish Communities]], accused him of anti-Semitism, writing "words of hatred that don't add anything new and are accompanied by the squalid reproposal of anti-Semitic stereotypes".<ref>{{cite news |date= July 17, 2014|title= Italian philosopher politician slammed as antiSemite|url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4081264,00.html|newspaper= Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno|location= Bari, Italy|access-date= July 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date= July 23, 2014|title= Spiritual leaders incite violence in Gaza conflict|url= http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/37964-140723-spiritual-leaders-incite-violence-in-gaza-conflict|newspaper= i24 News|location= Luxemburg|publisher= Newslux Sarl|access-date= July 23, 2014}}</ref> Rabbi Barbara Aiello, Italy's first female rabbi, also accused Vattimo of anti-Semitism. Reacting to his "Zionist bastards" statements and to others like it, the foreign ministers for Italy, France and Germany said that they condemn such language as well as violence that has occurred at pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Europe.<ref>{{cite news |last= Giuffrida|first= Angela|date= July 23, 2014|title= 'Shoot those bastard Zionists': Italian scholar|url= http://www.thelocal.it/20140723/shoot-those-bastard-zionists-top-italian-scholar|newspaper= The Local|location= Rome|publisher= The Local Europe AB|access-date= July 23, 2014}}</ref> Pronounced in a moment of indignation against the prolonged bombing of Gaza by the Israeli army, Vattimo apologized to an Israeli newspaper (''Haaretz''). "In a telephone interview [...], Gianni Vattimo said he “regrets” such words and “feels ashamed” by them",<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/.premium-1.607992|title = Italian Philosopher Apologizes for Saying He Wanted to 'Shoot Those Bastard Zionists'|newspaper = Haaretz}}</ref>  claiming he was "provoked" by the hosts of the show on which he made his comments.<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/.premium-1.607992], sur "<Haaretz>".</ref>
