Editor from 1982 to 2001 of ''[[The Salisbury Review]]'', a conservative political journal, Scruton wrote over 50 books on philosophy, art, music, politics, literature, culture, sexuality, and religion; he also wrote novels and two operas. His publications include ''The Meaning of Conservatism'' (1980), ''Sexual Desire'' (1986), ''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997), and ''[[How to Be a Conservative]]'' (2014). He was a regular contributor to the popular media, including ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'', and the ''[[New Statesman]]''.

Scruton explained that he embraced conservatism after witnessing the [[May 68|May 1968 student protests]] in France.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Scruton |first1=Roger |title=Why I became a conservative |url=https://newcriterion.com/issues/2003/2/why-i-became-a-conservative |website=The New Criterion |date=February 2003 |access-date=9 May 2023}}</ref> From 1971 to 1992 he was lecturer, reader, and then Professor of Aesthetics at [[Birkbeck College]], [[University of London|London]], after which he was Professor of Philosophy at [[Boston University]], from 1992 to 1995.<ref name=":1" /> From then on, he worked as a freelance writer and scholar, though he later held several part-time or temporary academic positions, including in the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=O'Hear |first=Anthony |author-link=Anthony O'Hear |date=26 November 2020 |title=Scruton, Roger, 1944-2020 |url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/documents/2740/19-Memoirs-21-Scruton.pdf |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy |issue=XIX |pages=447–465}}</ref> In the 1980s he helped to establish [[Jan Hus Educational Foundation|underground academic networks]] in [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe]], for which he was awarded the [[Czech Republic]]'s [[Medal of Merit (Czech Republic)|Medal of Merit]] (First Class) by President [[Václav Havel]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Day |first1= Barbara |title= The Velvet Philosophers |date=1999 |publisher=The Claridge Press|location=London | at= [https://books.google.com/books?id=jJNYvDr8YBgC&pg=PA281 281–82]}}</ref> Scruton was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[2016 Birthday Honours]] for "services to philosophy, teaching and public education".<ref name= LondonGazette />

==Early life==
===Family background===
Roger Scruton was born in [[Buslingthorpe, Lincolnshire]],<ref>Cumming, Naomi (January 2001). [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.50522 "Scruton, Roger"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404003921/http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.50522 |date=4 April 2019 }}. ''Grove Music Online''.</ref> to John "Jack" Scruton, a teacher from Manchester, and his wife, Beryl Claris Scruton (née Haynes), and was raised with his two sisters in [[High Wycombe]] and [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]].<ref name=Wroe28Oct2000/> The Scruton surname had been acquired relatively recently. Jack's father's birth certificate showed him as Matthew Lowe, after Matthew's mother, Margaret Lowe (Scruton's great-grandmother); the document made no mention of a father. However, Margaret Lowe had decided, for reasons unknown, to raise her son as Matthew Scruton instead. Scruton wondered whether she had been employed at the former Scruton Hall in [[Scruton]], Yorkshire, and whether that was where her child had been conceived.<ref>Scruton, Roger (2001). ''England: An Elegy''. London: Pimlico, 139–140.</ref>

Jack was raised in a [[Back-to-back house|back-to-back]] on Upper Cyrus Street, [[Ancoats]], an inner-city area of Manchester, and won a scholarship to Manchester High School, a [[grammar school]].<ref>''England: An Elegy'', 141.</ref> Scruton told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that Jack hated the upper classes and loved the countryside, while Beryl entertained "[[blue rinse|blue-rinsed]] friends" and was fond of romantic fiction.<ref name="Wroe28Oct2000">{{Cite news |last=Wroe |first=Nicholas |date=2000-10-28 |title=Thinking for England |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/28/politics |access-date=2024-01-04 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> He described his mother as "cherishing an ideal of gentlemanly conduct and social distinction that&nbsp;... [his] father set out with considerable relish to destroy".<ref>Scruton, Roger (2005). ''Gentle Regrets: Thoughts From a Life''. London: Continuum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wgtnHZE_6lwC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA11 11].</ref>

The Scrutons lived in a [[pebbledashed]] semi-detached house in Hammersley Lane, [[High Wycombe]].<ref name=Wroe28Oct2000/><ref name=Gentlep89>''Gentle Regrets'', 89.</ref> Although his parents had been brought up as Christians, they regarded themselves as humanists, so home was a "religion-free zone".<ref>Scruton, Roger (March 2009). [https://web.archive.org/web/20110225210343/http://spectator.org/archives/2009/03/10/the-new-humanism "The New Humanism"]. ''American Spectator''.</ref> Scruton's, indeed the whole family's, relationship with his father was difficult. He wrote in ''Gentle Regrets'' (2005): "Friends come and go, hobbies and holidays dapple the soulscape like fleeting sunlight in a summer wind, and the hunger for affection is cut off at every point by the fear of judgement."<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 94.</ref>

After passing his [[Eleven-plus|11-plus]], he attended the [[Royal Grammar School High Wycombe]] from 1954 to 1962,<ref name=about/><ref>''England: An Elegy'', 25.</ref> leaving with three [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-levels]], in pure and applied Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, which he passed with distinction. The results won him an open scholarship in Natural Sciences to [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], as well as a state scholarship.<ref>{{cite news |title=Examination successes, 1961–62 |url=http://www.rgs.saund.co.uk/pdfs/1962-09-wycombiensian.pdf |work=The Wycombiensian|volume=XIII |issue=6 |date=September 1962 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214003500/http://www.rgs.saund.co.uk/pdfs/1962-09-wycombiensian.pdf |archive-date=14 February 2017|at=328–330 |url-status=live}}</ref> When he told his family he had won a place at Cambridge, his father stopped speaking to him.<ref name="Edemariam5June2010">{{Cite news |last=Edemariam |first=Aida |date=2010-06-04 |title=Roger Scruton: A pessimist's guide to life |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jun/05/roger-scruton-interview |access-date=2024-01-04 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Scruton writes that he was expelled from the school shortly afterwards when, during one of Scruton's plays, the headmaster found the school stage on fire and a half-naked girl putting out the flames.<ref name=Wroe28Oct2000/><ref name="Gentlep34">''Gentle Regrets'', 34.</ref>

Having intended to study [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|Natural Sciences at Cambridge]], where he felt "although socially estranged (like virtually every grammar-school boy), spiritually at home",<ref name="Gentlep34"/> Scruton switched on the first day to Moral Sciences ([[Philosophy]]);<ref name=Wroe28Oct2000/> his supervisor was [[A. C. Ewing]].<ref>Scruton, Roger (2012). "Working toward Art". In Hamilton, Andy; Zangwill, Nick (eds.). ''Scruton's Aesthetics''. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1.</ref> He graduated with a [[double first]] in 1965,<ref name=cv/> then spent time overseas, some of it teaching at the [[University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour]] in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, where he met his first wife, Danielle Laffitte.<ref name=SDpp1835>{{cite book |last1=Scruton |first1=Roger |last2=Dooley |first2=Mark |title=Conversations with Roger Scruton |date=2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London and New York |at=18, 35 }}</ref> He also lived in Rome.<ref>"Working toward Art", ''Scruton's Aesthetics'', 2.</ref> His mother died around this time; she had been diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] and had undergone a [[mastectomy]] just before he went to Cambridge.<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 104ff.</ref>

In 1967, he began studying for his doctorate at Jesus College and then became a research fellow at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] (1969–1971), where he lived with Laffitte when she was not in France.<ref name=SDpp1835/> It was while visiting her during the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 student protests]] in France that Scruton first embraced [[conservatism]]. He was in the [[Latin Quarter in Paris]], watching students overturn cars, smash windows and tear up cobblestones, and for the first time in his life "felt a surge of political anger":<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 37.</ref>

<blockquote> I suddenly realised I was on the other side. What I saw was an unruly mob of self-indulgent middle-class hooligans. When I asked my friends what they wanted, what were they trying to achieve, all I got back was this ludicrous [[Marxist]] [[gobbledegook]]. I was disgusted by it, and thought there must be a way back to the defence of western civilization against these things. That's when I became a conservative. I knew I wanted to conserve things rather than pull them down.<ref name=Wroe28Oct2000/></blockquote>

==1970s–1980s==
===Birkbeck, first marriage===
[[File:Birkbeck College phototram.jpg|thumb|Scruton taught at [[Birkbeck College|Birkbeck]] for 21 years.]]
Cambridge awarded Scruton his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in January 1973 for a thesis titled "Art and imagination, a study in the philosophy of mind", supervised by [[Elizabeth Anscombe]].<ref>Scruton, Roger (1973). [https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/244964 "Art and imagination, a study in the philosophy of mind"] (doctoral thesis). Apollo, University of Cambridge repository. {{doi|10.17863/CAM.15915}}</ref> The thesis was the basis of his first book, ''Art and Imagination'' (1974). From 1971 he taught philosophy at [[Birkbeck College]], London, which specializes in adult education and holds its classes in the evening.<ref name=Gentlep39/> Meanwhile, Laffitte taught French at [[Putney High School]], and the couple lived together in a [[Harley Street]] apartment previously occupied by [[Delia Smith]].{{sfn|Scruton|Dooley|2016|loc=41}} They married in September 1973 at the [[Brompton Oratory]], a Catholic church in [[Knightsbridge]],<ref>"Marriages". ''The Times''. 1 October 1973, issue 58901, 19.</ref> and divorced in 1979.<ref name=Wroe28Oct2000/> Scruton's second book, ''The Aesthetics of Architecture'', was published that year.

Scruton said he was the only conservative at Birkbeck, except for the woman who served meals in the [[Senior Common Room]].<ref name=Gentlep39>''Gentle Regrets'', 39.</ref> Working there left Scruton's days free, so he used the time to study law at the [[Inns of Court School of Law]] (1974–1976) and was [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] in 1978; he never practised because he was unable to take a year off work to complete a [[pupillage]].<ref name=about>{{cite web |last1=Scruton |first1=Roger |title=About |url=http://www.roger-scruton.com/rs-cv.html |website=roger-scruton.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831023120/http://www.roger-scruton.com/rs-cv.html |archive-date=31 August 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 57; {{harvnb|Scruton|Dooley|2016|loc=39}}.</ref>

In 1974, along with [[Hugh Fraser (British politician)|Hugh Fraser]], [[Jonathan Aitken]] and [[John Casey (academic)|John Casey]], he became a founding member of the [[Conservative Philosophy Group]] dining club, which aimed to develop an intellectual basis for conservatism.<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 45; {{harvnb|Scruton|Dooley|2016|loc=46–47}}.</ref><ref name=Walker1March1983>{{cite news |last1=Walker |first1=Martin |title=The unthinkable men behind Mrs Thatcher |work=The Guardian |date=1 March 1983 |at=17}}</ref> The historian [[Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton|Hugh Thomas]] and the philosopher [[Anthony Quinton]] attended meetings, as did [[Margaret Thatcher]] before she became prime minister.

London: Pan Macmillan, 221.</ref>

According to Scruton, his academic career at Birkbeck was blighted by his conservatism, particularly by his third book, ''The Meaning of Conservatism'' (1980),<ref>Scruton, Roger (1980).

===''The Salisbury Review''===
[[File:Roger Scruton (2015), Prague.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Scruton in Prague, 2015]]
In 1982 Scruton became founding editor of ''[[The Salisbury Review]]'', a journal championing conservatism in opposition to [[Thatcherism]], which he edited until 2001.<ref name=ScrutonSept212002/><ref>Scruton, Roger (1988). ''Conservative Thoughts: Essays from the Salisbury Review''. London: The Claridge Press.</ref> The ''Review'' was set up by a group of Tories known as the Salisbury Group{{snd}}founded in 1978 by [[Diana Spearman]] and [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 6th Marquess of Salisbury|Robert Gascoyne-Cecil]]<ref name=Cowling1990pxxix/>{{snd}}with the involvement of the [[Peterhouse school of history|Peterhouse Right]]. The latter were conservatives associated with the Cambridge college, including [[Maurice Cowling]], [[David Watkin (historian)|David Watkin]] and the mathematician [[Adrian Mathias]].<ref name=Wroe28Oct2000/><ref>For the Peterhouse Right (he calls it the Peterhouse Group) and ''The Salisbury Review'', see Haseler, Stephen (1989). ''The battle for Britain: Thatcher and the New Liberals''. London: I.B. Tauris, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_vPwkkJUA6IC&pg=PA138 138]; ''Gentle Regrets'', 51.</ref><ref name=Walker1March1983/> As of 1983 it had a circulation of under 1,000; according to [[Martin Walker (reporter)|Martin Walker]], the circulation understated the journal's influence.<ref name=Walker1March1983/>

Scruton wrote that editing ''The Salisbury Review'' effectively ended his academic career in the United Kingdom. The magazine sought to provide an intellectual basis for conservatism, and was highly critical of key issues of the period, including the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, egalitarianism, feminism, foreign aid, multiculturalism and modernism.{{sfn|Scruton|Dooley|2016|loc=47}} In the first edition, he wrote: "It is necessary to establish a conservative dominance in intellectual life, not because this is the quickest or most certain way to political influence, but because in the long run, it is the only way to create a climate of opinion favourable to the conservative cause."<ref name=Walker1March1983/> To begin with, Scruton had to write most of the articles himself, using pseudonyms: "I had to make it look as though there was something there in order that ''there should be something there!''"{{sfn|Scruton|Dooley|2016|loc=47}} He believes that the ''Review'' "helped a new generation of conservative intellectuals to emerge. At last it was possible to be a conservative and also to the ''left'' of something, to say 'Of course, the ''Salisbury Review'' is beyond the pale; but&nbsp;...{{'"}}<ref name=Gentlep59>''Gentle Regrets'', 59.</ref>

In 1984 the ''Review'' published a controversial article by [[Ray Honeyford]], a headmaster in Bradford, questioning the benefits of multicultural education.<ref>Honeyford, Ray (27 August 2006).

===Writing===
The 1980s established Scruton as a prolific writer. Thirteen of his non-fiction works appeared between 1980 and 1989, as did his first novel, ''Fortnight's Anger'' (1981). The most contentious publication was ''[[Thinkers of the New Left]]'' (1985), a collection of his essays from ''The Salisbury Review'', which criticized 14 prominent intellectuals, including [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].{{efn|The subjects of ''[[Thinkers of the New Left]]'' are [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[R. D.

From 1983 to 1986 he wrote a weekly column for ''The Times''. Topics included music, wine and motorbike repair, but others were contentious.

===Activism in Central Europe===
[[File:Roger Scruton, Budapest, September 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Scruton on "Europe and the Conservative Cause", Budapest, September 2016]]
From 1979 to 1989, Scruton was an active supporter of [[dissident]]s in [[Czechoslovakia]] under [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]] rule, forging links between the country's dissident academics and their counterparts in Western universities. As part of the [[Jan Hus Educational Foundation]],{{sfn|Day|1999|loc=124ff}} he and other academics visited [[Prague]] and [[Brno]], now in the [[Czech Republic]], in support of an underground education network started by the Czech dissident [[Julius Tomin]], smuggling in books, organizing lectures, and eventually arranging for students to study for a Cambridge external degree in theology (the only faculty that responded to the request for help). There were structured courses and ''[[samizdat]]'' translations, books were printed, and people sat exams in a cellar with papers smuggled out through the diplomatic bag.<ref>Vaughan, David (31 October 2010).

Scruton was detained in 1985 in Brno before being expelled from the country. The Czech dissident [[:cs:Bronislava Müllerová|Bronislava Müllerová]] watched him walk across the border with Austria: "There was this broad empty space between the two border posts, absolutely empty, not a single human being in sight except for one soldier, and across that broad empty space trudged an English philosopher, Roger Scruton, with his little bag into Austria."{{sfn|Day|1999|loc=255}} On 17 June that year, he was placed on the Index of Undesirable Persons. He wrote that he had also been followed during visits to Poland and Hungary.<ref name=Day1999p281/>

For his work in supporting dissidents, Scruton was awarded the First of June Prize in 1993 by the Czech city of [[Plzeň]], and in 1998 he was awarded the Czech Republic's [[Medal of Merit (Czech Republic)|Medal of Merit]] (First Class) by President [[Václav Havel]].<ref name=Day1999p281>{{harvnb|Day|1999|loc=281–282}}; ''Gentle Regrets'', 142.</ref> In 2019 the Polish government awarded him the [[Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland]].<ref name=AP4June2019>{{cite news |title=Poland Bestows Honor on Philosopher Fired by British Govt |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-06-04/poland-bestows-honor-on-british-philosopher |work=U.S. News & World Report |agency=Associated Press |date=4 June 2019}}</ref> Scruton was strongly critical of figures in the West{{snd}}in particular [[Eric Hobsbawm]]{{snd}}who "chose to exonerate" the crimes and atrocities of former communist regimes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-05-me-2147-story.html |title=The Day of Reckoning for the Apologists: Western collaborators with Soviet communism must be held accountable |work=Los Angeles Times|date=18 February 1987}}</ref> His experience of dissident intellectual life in 1980s Communist Prague is recorded in fictional form in his novel ''[[Notes from Underground (Scruton novel)|Notes from Underground]]'' (2014).<ref name=Derbyshire12Sept2014>{{cite news |last1=Derbyshire |first1=Jonathan |title=How to be a conservative: a conversation with Roger Scruton |url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/blogs/jonathan-derbyshire/how-to-be-a-conservative-a-conversation-with-roger-scruton |work=Prospect |date=12 September 2014}}</ref> He wrote in 2019 that "despite the appeal of the Poles, Hungarians, Romanians and many more, it is the shy, cynical Czechs to whom I lost my heart and from whom I have never retrieved it".<ref name=Scruton21Dec2019/>

===Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission===

In April 2019, an interview of Scruton by [[George Eaton (journalist)|George Eaton]] appeared in the ''New Statesman''.

===Aesthetics===
According to [[Paul Guyer]], in ''A History of Modern Aesthetics: The Twentieth Century'', "After [[Richard Wollheim|Wollheim]], the most significant British aesthetician has been Roger Scruton."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZ2NmgEACAAJ|title = A History of Modern Aesthetics: The twentieth century|isbn = 9781107038059|last1 = Guyer|first1 = Paul|year = 2014| publisher=Cambridge University Press }}</ref> Scruton was trained in [[analytic philosophy]], although he was drawn to other traditions. "I remain struck by the thin and withered countenance that philosophy quickly assumes," he wrote in 2012, "when it wanders away from art and literature, and I cannot open a journal like ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' or ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'' without experiencing an immediate sinking of the heart, like opening a door into a morgue."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scruton |first1=Roger |title=Confessions of a Sceptical Francophile |journal=Philosophy |date=October 2012 |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=477–495 |doi=10.1017/S0031819112000368 |s2cid=170134935 |url=https://www.roger-scruton.com/articles/284-confessions-of-a-sceptical-francophile}}</ref>

He specialised in [[aesthetics]] throughout his career. From 1971 to 1992 he taught aesthetics at Birkbeck College. His PhD thesis formed the basis of his first book, ''Art and Imagination'' (1974), in which he argued that "what demarcates aesthetic interest from other sorts is that it involves the appreciation of something for its own sake".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.pjaesthetics.org/index.php/pjaesthetics/article/view/12/11 |title=Imagination, Attitude and Experience in Aesthetic Judgement|first=Cain|last=Samuel Todd|journal=Postgraduate Journal of Aesthetics|date=April 2004}}</ref><ref>"Working toward Art", ''Scruton's Aesthetics'', 2–5.</ref> He subsequently published ''The Aesthetics of Architecture'' (1979), ''The Aesthetic Understanding'' (1983), ''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997),<ref name=":1">Watt, Stephen (2005).

In an [[Intelligence Squared]] debate in March 2009, Scruton (seconding historian [[David Starkey]]) proposed the motion: "Britain has become indifferent to beauty", and held an image of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' next to one of the supermodel [[Kate Moss]].<ref>Bayley, Stephen (22 March 2009). [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/mar/22/national-trust-intelligence-squad "Has Britain become indifferent to beauty?]. ''The Guardian''.</ref> Later that year he wrote and presented a [[BBC Two]] documentary, ''[[Why Beauty Matters]]'', in which he argued that beauty should be restored to its traditional position in art, architecture and music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p6tsd |title=Why Beauty Matters |publisher=BBC Two |date=28 November 2009}}</ref> He wrote that he had received "more than 500 e-mails from viewers, all but one saying, 'Thank Heavens someone is saying what needs to be said.{{'"}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Scruton |first=Roger |url=http://spectator.org/archives/2010/05/17/on-defending-beauty |title=On Defending Beauty |work=The American Spectator |date=May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519110549/http://spectator.org/archives/2010/05/17/on-defending-beauty |archive-date=19 May 2010 }}</ref> In 2018 he argued that a belief in God makes for more beautiful architecture:

The philosopher of religion Christopher Hamilton described Scruton's ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986) as "the most interesting and insightful philosophical account of sexual desire" produced within [[analytic philosophy]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hamilton |first1=Christopher |editor1-last= Soble |editor1-first=Alan |editor2-last=Power |editor2-first=Nicholas P. |title=The Philosophy of Sex: Contemporary Readings | edition=5th |date=2008 |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |location=Lanham, MD |isbn=978-0-74254798-8 |at=101}}</ref> The book influenced subsequent discussions of sexual ethics.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barnhill |first1=Anne |editor1-last=Crasnow |editor1-first=Sharon L. |editor2-last=Superson |editor2-first=Anita M. |title=Out from the Shadows: Analytical Feminist Contributions to Traditional Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=2012 |at=[https://archive.org/details/outfromshadowsan0000unse/page/115 115–116] |isbn=978-0-19985547-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/outfromshadowsan0000unse/page/115 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1= Plaxton |first1=Michael |title= Implied Consent and Sexual Assault: Intimate Relationships, Autonomy, and Voice |publisher= [[McGill-Queen's University Press]] |location=Montreal |year=2015 |at=221, 223 |isbn= 978-0-77354620-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Janaway |first1=Christopher |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |at=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/816 816] |isbn=978-0-19-866132-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/816 }}</ref> [[Martha Nussbaum]] (who had reviewed the work in 1986)<ref>{{Cite news |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha C. |date=December 18, 1986 |title=Sex in the Head {{!}} Martha C.

According to [[Jonathan Dollimore]], Scruton based a conservative sexual ethic on the Hegelian proposition that "the final end of every rational being is the building of the self", which involves recognizing the other as an end in itself. Scruton argues that the major feature of perversion is "sexual release that avoids or abolishes [[Other (philosophy)|the ''other'']]", which he sees as [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] and [[Solipsism|solipsistic]].<ref name=Dollimore260>[[Dollimore, Jonathan]] (1991). ''Sexual Dissidence: Augustine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault''. Oxford University Press, 260–261.</ref> Nussbaum countered that Scruton did not apply his principle of otherness equally{{snd}}for example, to sexual relationships between adults and children or between Protestants and Catholics.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha C. |date=2009-09-10 |title=The Passion Fashion |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/69203/the-passion-fashion |access-date=2024-01-04 |magazine=The New Republic |issn=0028-6583}}</ref>

In an essay, "Sexual morality and the liberal consensus" (1990), Scruton wrote that [[homosexuality]] leads to the "de-sanctifying of the human body" because the body of the homosexual's lover belongs to the same category as his own.<ref>Scruton, Roger (1990). ''The Philosopher on Dover Beach''. Manchester: Carcanet Press, 268.</ref> He further argued that gay people have no children and consequently no interest in creating a socially stable future. He therefore considered it justified to "instil in our children feelings of revulsion" towards homosexuality,<ref name="Stafford1991">{{Cite journal |last=Stafford |first=J.

===Religion===
Scruton was an [[Anglican]]. His book ''Our Church: A Personal History of the Church of England'' (2013) defended the relevance of the [[Church of England]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=19 June 2013|title=Our Church by Roger Scruton – review|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/19/our-church-roger-scruton-review|access-date=12 January 2021|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> He contends, following [[Immanuel Kant]], that human beings have a transcendental dimension, a sacred core exhibited in their capacity for [[self-reflection]].<ref>Dooley, Mark (2009).

Eliot]], [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]] "devoted much energy to recuperating the experience of the sacred{{snd}}but as a private rather than a public form of consciousness." Because these thinkers directed their art at the few, he writes, it has never appealed to the many.<ref name= Arguments142>''Arguments for Conservatism'', 142–43, 146–47, 150–53.</ref>

On the matter of evidence of God's existence, Scruton said: "Rational argument can get us just so far... It can help us to understand the real difference between a faith that commands us to forgive our enemies, and one that commands us to slaughter them. But the leap of faith itself{{snd}}this placing of your life at God's service{{snd}}is a leap over reason's edge. This does not make it irrational, any more than falling in love is irrational."<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/science/sc0078.html |title= Science |access-date= 2 December 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160702045802/http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/science/sc0078.html | work = Catholic education |archive-date= 2 July 2016 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all}}</ref> But despite claiming that belief alone is sufficiently rational, he advocated a form of the [[argument from beauty]]: he said that when we take the beauty in the natural world around us as a gift, we are able to openly understand God.

===Education===
Scruton considered that moral education should be "endarkening" as well as "enlightening", with "endarkening" being used as the inverse of "enlightening". "Endarkenment" is Scruton's way of describing the process of socialization through which certain behaviours and choices are closed off and forbidden to the subject, which he considers necessary to curb socially damaging impulses and behaviour:<ref name="Stafford1991" /><blockquote>moral education cannot be ... purely enlightened and enlightening ... it cannot be simply a matter of teaching [people] to calculate the long term profit and the loss, while leaving .. desires to develop independently. It must involve an endarkened and endarkening component, by which [people] are taught precisely to cease [their] calculations, to regard certain paths as forbidden, as places where neither profit nor loss has authority.<ref>Ireland, Paddy (March 1997).

Scruton wrote in ''Gentle Regrets'' (2005) that he found several of Burke's arguments in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790) persuasive. Although Burke was writing about revolution, not socialism, Scruton was persuaded that, as he put it, the utopian promises of socialism are accompanied by an abstract vision of the mind that bears little relation to the way most people think. Burke also convinced him that there is no direction to history, no moral or spiritual progress; that people think collectively toward a common goal only during crises such as war, and that trying to organize society this way requires a real or imagined enemy; hence, Scruton wrote, the strident tone of socialist literature.<ref name=Regretsp40/>

Scruton further argued, following Burke, that society is held together by authority and the [[rule of law]], in the sense of the right to obedience, not by the imagined rights of citizens. Obedience, he wrote, is "the prime virtue of political beings, the disposition that makes it possible to govern them, and without which societies crumble into 'the dust and powder of individuality{{'"}}. Real freedom does not stand in conflict with obedience, but is its other side.<ref name=Regretsp40>''Gentle Regrets'', 40–41.</ref> He was also persuaded by Burke's arguments about the [[social contract]], including that most parties to the contract are either dead or not yet born. To forget this, he wrote{{snd}}to throw away customs and institutions{{snd}}is to "place the present members of society in a dictatorial dominance over those who went before, and those who came after them".<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 43.</ref>

Beliefs that appear to be examples of prejudice may be useful and important, he wrote: "our most necessary beliefs may be both unjustified and unjustifiable, from our own perspective, and the attempt to justify them will merely lead to their loss." A prejudice in favour of [[modesty]] in women and [[chivalry]] in men, for example, may aid the stability of sexual relationships and the raising of children, although these are not offered as reasons in support of the prejudice. It may therefore be easy to show the prejudice as irrational, but there will be a loss nonetheless if it is discarded.<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 42.</ref>

[[File:Nexus Masterclass Roger Scruton, November 2015.webm|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Scruton discussing the [[European Union]] and the [[nation state]], November 2015]]

In ''Arguments for Conservatism'' (2006), Scruton marked out the areas in which philosophical thinking is required if conservatism is to be intellectually persuasive. He argued that human beings are creatures of limited and local affections. Territorial loyalty is at the root of all forms of government where law and liberty reign supreme; every expansion of jurisdiction beyond the frontiers of the nation state leads to a decline in accountability.<ref>Scruton, Roger (2006). ''A Political Philosophy: Arguments for Conservatism''. London: Bloomsbury, 3, 19.</ref>

He opposed elevating the "nation" above its people, which would threaten rather than facilitate citizenship and peace. "Conservatism and conservation" are two aspects of a single policy, that of husbanding resources, including the [[social capital]] embodied in laws, customs and institutions, and the material capital contained in the environment. He argued further that the law should not be used as a weapon to advance special interests. People impatient for reform{{snd}}for example in the areas of [[euthanasia]] or [[abortion]]{{snd}}are reluctant to accept what may be "glaringly obvious to others{{snd}}that the law exists precisely to impede their ambitions".<ref>''Arguments for Conservatism'', 15, 34, 69.</ref>

===Postmodernism===
Scruton defines [[post-modernism]] as the claim that there are no grounds for truth, objectivity, and meaning, and that conflicts between views are therefore nothing more than contests of power. Scruton argued that, while the West is required to judge other cultures in their own terms, Western culture is adversely judged as ethnocentric and racist. He wrote: "The very reasoning which sets out to destroy the ideas of objective truth and absolute value imposes political correctness as absolutely binding, and cultural relativism as objectively true."<ref>''Arguments for Conservatism'', 106, 115, 117.</ref>

===Feminism===
Scruton was critical of the contemporary [[Feminism|feminist]] movement, while reserving praise for suffragists such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].<ref name=Edemariam5June2010/> However, he praised [[Germaine Greer]] in 2016, saying that she had "cast an awful lot of light on our literary tradition" by showing the male as the dominant figure, and defended her against criticism for having used the word "sex" to describe the difference between men and women, rather than "gender", which Scruton called "politically correct".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm8e41sKUZE&t=29m43s|title=Roger Scruton's speech in Copenhagen, 14 May 2016|date=14 May 2016|author=Danish Free Press Society|publisher=Free Press|via=YouTube}}</ref>

===Monarchy===
Scruton was a supporter of [[constitutional monarchy]], arguing it is "the light above politics, which shines down on the human bustle from a calmer and more exalted sphere."<ref>{{Cite web|date=27 September 2020 |title='Is this the end of the House of Sussex?' by Peter Hunt|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/is-this-the-end-of-the-house-of-sussex-|website=The Spectator|language=en}}</ref> In a 1991 column for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', he argued that monarchy helped create peace in Central Europe and it was "the loss of it that precipitated 70 years of conflict on the Continent."<ref>{{Cite web|date=16 June 1991|title='A Focus of Loyalty Higher Than the State : The monarchy created peace in Central Europe, and its loss precipitated 70 years of conflict.' by Roger Scruton|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-06-16-op-1275-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en}}</ref>

===Totalitarianism===
Scruton defined [[totalitarianism]] as the absence of any constraint on central authority, with every aspect of life the concern of government. Advocates of totalitarianism feed on resentment, Scruton argues, and having seized power they proceed to abolish institutions{{snd}}such as the law, property, and religion{{snd}}that create authorities: "To the resentful it is these institutions that are the cause of inequality, and therefore the cause of their humiliations and failures." He argues that revolutions are not conducted from below by the people, but from above, in the name of the people, by an aspiring elite.<ref name=Arguments142/> The importance of [[Newspeak]] in totalitarian societies, he writes, is that the power of language to describe reality is replaced by language whose purpose is to avoid encounters with realities. He agrees with [[Alain Besançon]] that the totalitarian society envisaged by [[George Orwell]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) can be only understood in theological terms, as a society founded on a transcendental negation. In accordance with [[T. S. Eliot]], Scruton believes that true originality is only possible within a tradition, and that it is precisely in modern conditions{{snd}}conditions of fragmentation, heresy, and unbelief{{snd}}that the conservative project acquires its sense.<ref>''Arguments for Conservatism'', 162–163, 182, 194.</ref>

===English independence===
In 2014, Scruton said he supported [[English independence]] because he believed it would uphold friendship between [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]], and because the English would have a say in all matters.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26173128 |title=A Point of View: Should the English have a say on Scottish independence? |date=23 February 2014 | work=BBC News}}</ref> In 2019, when asked if he believed in English independence, he told the ''New Statesman'':

<blockquote>No, I don't think I've ever really favoured English independence. My view is that if the Scots want to be independent then we should aim for the same thing&nbsp;... I don't think the Welsh want independence, the Northern Irish certainly don't. The Scottish desire for independence is, to some extent, a fabrication. They want to identify themselves as Scots but still&nbsp;... enjoy the subsidy they get from being part of the kingdom. I can see there are Scottish nationalists who envision something more than that, but if that becomes a real political force then yeah, we should try for independence too. As it is, as you know, the Scots have two votes: they can vote for their own parliament and vote to put their people into our parliament, who come to our parliament with no interest in Scotland but an interest in bullying us.<ref name=Statesmanfulltranscript/></blockquote>

===British sovereignty===
Scruton strongly supported [[Brexit]], because he believed that the [[European Union]] is a threat to the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and that Brexit will help retain national identity, which he saw as under threat as a result of mass immigration, and because he opposed the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]. He also opposed the metrification of weights and measures and believed it was an 'affront to the British people, its history and its long established patterns of trade'.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Point of View - After the Vote - Democracy After Brexit - Democracy After Brexit - BBC Sounds |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b07ldrbk |access-date=2024-04-25 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roger-scruton.com/articles/482-brexit-will-restore-a-proper-sense-of-patriotism-the-times-comment-17-nov-17|title='Brexit will restore a proper sense of patriotism'.

[[Mario Vargas Llosa]], a winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, wrote: "[Scruton] was one of the most educated people I have ever met.

Conservative MEP [[Daniel Hannan]] called Scruton "the greatest conservative of our age", adding: "The country has lost a towering intellect. I have lost a wonderful friend."

In an essay critical of Scruton's philosophy of aesthetics, "The Art of Madness and Mystery", published in ''Church Life'' (a journal of the [[University of Notre Dame]]'s McGrath Institute) shortly after Scruton's death, Michael Shindler wrote that "like the Roman guard who would not abandon his post during the cataclysm of Pompeii, the late Roger Scruton stands in lonesome majesty as the artistic tradition's greatest defender athwart modernity's aesthetic upheaval."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shindler |first1=Michael |title=The Art of Madness and Mystery |journal=Church Life Journal |date=2 March 2020 |url=https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/an-intelligent-persons-guide-to-contemporary-art-appreciation/ |access-date=10 March 2020 |publisher=The McGrath Institute for Church Life, University of Notre Dame}}</ref>

Scruton's funeral was held on 24 January 2020 at [[Malmesbury Abbey]] with the attendance of several peers, Conservative politicians, and Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]]. After the ceremony, which was presided by the Reverend Oliver Ross, Scruton's remains were buried in Garsdon churchyard.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lees |first=Mark |date=24 January 2020 |title=RIP Roger Scruton (1944-2020) |url=https://www.theoldie.co.uk/blog/rip-sir-roger-scruton-1944-2020 |access-date= |website=[[The Oldie]] |language=en-gb}}</ref>
