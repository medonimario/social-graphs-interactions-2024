==Early life==
Al-Juwayni was born on 17 February 1028  in a village on the outskirts of [[Nishapur|Naysabur]] called Bushtaniqan in Iran,<ref name=civ>Al-Juwayni, Yusef. A Guide to the Conclusive Proofs for the Principles of Belief. 1 ed. Eissa S. Muhammad. The Center for Muslim Contribution to Civilization, 2000</ref> Al-Juwayni was a prominent [[Muslim]] scholar known for his gifted intellect in Islamic legal matters. Al-Juwayni was born into a family of legal study. His father, [[Abu Muhammad al-Juwayni]], was a well-known master of law in the Shafi′i community as well as a Shafi'i teacher and his older brother, Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali al-Juwayni, was a Sufi teacher of Hadith.

===Education===
Al-Juwayni grew up in Naysabur,<ref name=civ/> an intellectually thriving area drawing scholars to it. Early on, al-Haramayn studied a variety of fundamental religious subjects under his father, [[Abu Muhammad al-Juwayni]]. These subjects included the [[Arabic grammar]] and its eloquence (balagha), the [[Quran]], the [[hadith]], the ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic law), khilaf (the art of disagreements), and [[principles of Islamic jurisprudence]]. He even read and studied all of his father's books, including Sharh al-Muzani, Sharh usul al-Shafi'i, Mukhtasar al-Mukhtasar, al-Tafsir al-Kabir, and al-Tabsirah. He had a solid foundation in Shafi'i law. His father was a well-known Shafi'i scholar, so al-Haramayn had a strong intellectual lineage, and he was well-established in Shafi'i circles in Nishapur because of two factors: his thorough understanding of the Shafi'i legal tradition, to the point where he could offer his [[ijtihad]], and his assumption of his father's role as a house tutor following his death in 439/1047.<ref name="P.M.I.S">{{cite book|author=Mehdi Berriah, Mohamad El-Merheb|title=Professional Mobility in Islamic Societies (700-1750) - New Concepts and Approaches|date=16 August 2021|publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers|Brill]]|isbn=9789004467637|pages=163–164}}</ref>

===Teachers===
In addition to his father's studies, under [[Abu al-Qasim al-Isfarayini]], the son of [[Abu Ishaq al-Isfarayini]], he studied [[Islamic theology]] and legal theory. Under [[al-Bayhaqi]], he studied hadith. Further [[Arabic grammar|Arabic grammatical instruction]] was received by Imam al-Haraym from Abu al-Hassan 'Ali b. Fadl b. 'Ali al-Majashi, while Abu 'Abdullah al-Khabbazi provided [[Tafsir|Quranic exegesis]]. Regarding the [[Hadith studies|study of hadith]] and its dissemination, Imam al-Haramayn acquired knowledge from various sources. He received [[Biographical evaluation|hadith transmission]] from scholars like Abu Bakr Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Tamimi, Abu Sa'd 'Abd al-Rahman b. Hamdan al-Nadrawi, Abu Hassan Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Muzakki, Abu Abdullah Muhammad b. Ibrahim al-Tarrazi, and Abu Muhammad al-Jawharri in addition to learning from his father and al-Bayhaqi. Following his acquisition of a firm foundation in the fundamental disciplines of Islamic studies, Imam al-Haramayn began to broaden his horizons intellectually in order to forge greater religious credentials within the Ash'ari theological school and Shafi'i legal school. In addition to learning fiqh and usul al-fiqh from his father, Imam al-Haramayn received some legal instruction from the leaders of the Shafi'is in [[Marw]], al-Qadi Abu ali Husayn b. Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Marw al-Rudhi, and al-Qasim al-Furani. After that, he visited [[Isfahan]], [[Baghdad]], and [[Hejaz]], where he met academics. He made use of the chance to learn both fiqh and usul al-fiqh. In addition to acquiring expertise in the legal sciences, Imam al-Haramayn founded a robust intellectual and pedagogical legacy within the Shafi'i legal tradition.<ref name="P.M.I.S" />

==Fleeing and coming back==
Al-Juwayni was left to flee [[Nishapur]] by force when the [[Karramiyya|Karramite]] governor Al-Kundduri passed a verdict to curse Abu Hassan al-Ashari during the weekly Friday prayer gatherings and to imprison any of his adherents. Among those that were forced to secretly flee were Abu Sahl al-Bastami, Al-Furati, [[Al-Qushayri]], and [[Al-Bayhaqi]] and many other scholars of the Shafi'is.<ref name="biography" />

As a result Al-Juwayni fled to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] in search of a new home. He taught knowledge and wrote books in [[Hijaz]] for four years.<ref name=mess>Messick, Brinkley. "Kissing Hands and Knees: Hegemony and Hierarchy in Shari'a Discourse." Law & Society Review 22, no. 4 (1988): 637-660.</ref> His scholarship was so widely acclaimed amongst the scholars of the Hejaz that he acquired the title of ''Imam al Haramayn'' meaning "leading master of the [[Haram (site)|two holy cities]]". He gained a large following and was invited back to [[Nishapur]] as an undisputed grand [[mufti]] once [[Nizam al-Mulk|Nizam Al Mulk]] took power, and was appointed the headmaster of newly-built prestigious [[Nizamiyya]] school where he stayed for the next 30 years, training and preparing for the next generation of Shafi'i jurists and Ash'ari theologians.<ref name="biography" /> Al-Juwayni spent his life studying and producing influential treatises in Muslim government; it is suspected that most of his works (below) came out of this period after his return from Mecca and Medina.<ref name=civ/>

==Students==
Al-Juwayni had over 400 students; his most famous students became world famous scholars of their time and they include:<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Ibn Khallikan]]|translator=[[William McGuckin de Slane]]|title=Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary|date=1999|publisher=[[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]]|isbn=|volume=2|page=170}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Watt |first1=W.

* [[Abu al-Hasan al-Tabari]]
* [[Abu al-Hasan al-Bakhirzi]]

[[Al-Ghazali]] was the foremost pupil of Al-Juwayni and who became one of the most influential scholars in the Islamic history.<ref name="alWaraqat"/><ref name=mess/> Following are some of the famous remarks of al-Juwayni towards al-Ghazali:

{{cquote|
Al-Ghazali is a quenching sea in which you can drown in.<ref>Tabaqat al-Shafi'i al-Kubra, Taj al-Din al-Subki, Volume 6, Page 195</ref> 
}}

{{cquote|
You buried me while I am still alive. Can't you wait until I'm dead? (By this al-Juwanyni meant, your books outshine me) <ref>Imam Dhahabi's Siyar alam Nubala, Volume 19, Page 335</ref>
}}

==Death==
He died of liver disease and was buried at his home after a huge crowd attended his funeral. Unrestrained demonstration of sorrow by four hundred of his over-zealous students lasted for days in Khurasan. [[Ibn Asakir]] said: "I believe that the marks of his hard work and striving in Allah's religion shall endure until the rising of the Hour."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://damas-original.nur.nu/Texter/bionotes/bio_ibn-juwayni-gfh.html|title=IMAM AL-HARAMAYN IBN AL-JUWAYNI (419 - 478) By Dr. G.F. Haddad |website=damas-original.nur.nu}}</ref>

==Doctrine==
{{Ash'arism}}
Al-Juwayni, a [[Sunni]] [[jurist]] and [[Mutakallim]], or scholar engaged in the study of theological principles, spent his life deciphering between what a Muslim ought and ought not to do. He was said to be stubborn and unaccepting of any legal speculation whatsoever. His basic principle was that the law should not be left to speculation on any grounds. Rather, texts hold the answers to any possible legal debate in some capacity or another.<ref name=civ/>

==Reception==
Ibn Asakir said: "the Glory of Islam, absolute Imam of all imams, main authority in the Law, whose leadership is agreed upon East and West, whose immense merit is the consensus of Arabs and non-Arabs, upon the like of whom none set eyes before or after." [[Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari|Al-Kawthari]] said: "whose work forms the connecting link between the respective methods of the Salaf and Khalaf."<ref name="biography" />

Al-Bakhirzi made a comparison of Al-Juwanyi's to [[Al-Shafi'i]] and [[Al-Muzani]] in [[fiqh|jurisprudence]], [[Al-Asmaʿi]] in manners, [[Al-Hasan al-Basri]] in preaching eloquence, and [[Al-Ash'ari]] in [[kalam|speculative theology]]. Ibn Asakir replied and said: "Truly he is above that by far." [[Ibn al-Subki]] said: "Whoever thinks that there is anyone in the Four Schools that comes near his clarity of speech has no knowledge of him."<ref name="biography" />

==Works==
His well-known works:

===Kalam===
* ''[[A Guide to Conclusive Proofs for the Principles of Belief|Al-Irshad]]'', is a major classic of [[Islamic theology]].
* ''{{ill|Al-Shamil fi Usul al-Din|ar|الشامل في أصول الدين (كتاب)}}'' (Summa on the Principles of Religion)
* ''{{ill|Al-'Aqida al-Nizamiyya|ar|العقيدة النظامية في الأركان الإسلامية (كتاب)}}'' (The Nizami Creed)
* ''{{ill|Luma' al-Adilla fi Qawa'id 'Aqā'id Ahl al-Sunna|ar|لمع الأدلة في قواعد عقائد أهل السنة والجماعة (كتاب)}}'' (Flashes of Proof Concerning the Principles of the Doctrines of the People of the Sunna)

===Fiqh===
* ''[[The End of the Quest in the Knowledge of the Shafi'i School|Nihayat al-Matlab fi Dirayat al-Madhhab]]'' {{Lang|ar|نهاية المطلب في دراية المذهب}} ({{Lang|ar|نهاية المطلب في دراية المذهب}}, "The End of the Quest in the Knowledge of the [Shafi'i] School"), his magnum opus, which [[Ibn Asakir|Ibn 'Asakir]] said had no precedent in Islam.
* ''Ghiyath al-Umam'' ({{Lang|ar|غياث الأمم}})
* ''Mughith al-Khalq'' ({{Lang|ar|مغيث الخلق}})
* ''Mukhtasar al-Nihaya

===Usul al-Fiqh===
* [[Book of Demonstration on Jurisprudence|Al-Burhan]], considered as one of the four main books in this science. 
* Al-Talkhis
* Al-Waraqat

The book ''[[Fara'id al-Simtayn]]'' is sometimes mistakenly thought to be authored by the Sunni Abd'al Malik al-Juwayni. It was in fact authored by another Sunni scholar, Ibrahim bin Muhammad bin Himaway al Juwaynim who died in 1322 (722 A.H.)<ref>Mu`ajam al-Mu`alafeen Vol.1 Page 89</ref>
