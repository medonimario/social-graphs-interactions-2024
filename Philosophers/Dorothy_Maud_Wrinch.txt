'''Dorothy Maud Wrinch''' (12 September 1894 – 11 February 1976; married names '''Nicholson''', '''Glaser''') was a mathematician and [[biochemical]] theorist best known for her attempt to deduce [[protein]] structure using mathematical principles. She was a champion of the controversial '[[cyclol]]' hypothesis for the structure of proteins.

==Career==
Dorothy Wrinch was born in [[Rosario, Argentina]], the daughter of Hugh Edward Hart Wrinch, an engineer, and Ada Souter. The family returned to England and Dorothy grew up in [[Surbiton]], near London. She attended [[Surbiton High School]] and in 1913 entered [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]], Cambridge to read mathematics. Wrinch often attended meetings of the Heretics Club run by [[Charles Kay Ogden]], and it was through a 1914 lecture organised by Ogden that she first heard [[Bertrand Russell]] speak.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=I died for beauty : Dorothy Wrinch and the cultures of science|first=Marjorie|last=Senechal|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0199732593|location=Oxford|oclc=785874210}}</ref> She graduated in 1916 as a [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]].<ref name="creese">{{cite ODNB|last1=Creese|first1=Mary R.S.|title=Wrinch, Dorothy Maud (1894–1976)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/53495|year=2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/53495 |access-date=11 July 2005}}</ref>

For the academic year 1916–1917, Wrinch took the Cambridge [[Human science|Moral Sciences]] [[tripos]] and studied [[symbolic logic|mathematical logic]] with Russell in London. In December she was invited to [[Garsington Manor]], the home of Russell's then mistress [[Lady Ottoline Morrell|Ottoline Morell]], and there encountered [[Clive Bell]] and other Bloomsbury Group members, and in 1917 she introduced Russell to [[Dora Russell|Dora Black]] who would later become his second wife.  From 1917 Wrinch was funded by Girton College as a research student, officially supervised by [[G. H. Hardy|G.H. Hardy]] in Cambridge but in practice by Russell in London.<ref name=":0" /> When, in May 1918, Russell was imprisoned for his anti-war activities, Wrinch assisted with his writing projects by bringing him books and articles.<ref name=":0" /> Wrinch also secured the first publication of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s (not yet so named) ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'' in a German philosophical journal in 1921.<ref name=":0" />

In London Wrinch attended the [[Aristotelian Society]], including a debate between [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson|D'Arcy Thompson]] and [[John Scott Haldane]] on the nature of physics, biology and psychology, and she became a friend of Thompson. Wrinch spoke to the Society herself on the 'summation of pleasures', and through the Society she encountered [[Harold Jeffreys]] and [[Raphael Demos]]. In the autumn of 1918 Wrinch registered for graduate study on asymptotic expansions with the applied mathematician John Nicholson at King's College London, started to teach at University College, and continued to work with Jeffreys on the philosophy of scientific method. She moved into a flat in Mecklenburgh Square owned by Russell's then mistress Colette O'Neil. In 1920 Girton awarded Wrinch a four-year Yarrow Research Fellowship with the freedom to work on any area of her choice. In 1920 she was awarded an MSc and in 1921 a DSc by the University of London. Wrinch moved to Oxford in 1922 upon her marriage, where she held a succession of research fellowships and lectureships or tutorships at the Oxford women's colleges for the next 16 years.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="creese" /> She was Lady Carlisle Research Fellow at [[Somerville College, Oxford]] and first female Lecturer in Mathematics at the University. In 1929 she was the first woman to receive an Oxford [[DSc]].<ref name="creese" />

Wrinch's first paper was a 1917 defence of Russell's philosophy,<ref name=":0" /> and between 1918 and 1932 she published 20 papers on pure and applied mathematics and 16 on [[scientific methodology]] and on the [[philosophy of science]]. At the 1928 International Congress of Mathematics in Bologna she delivered the paper "On a method for constructing harmonics for surfaces of revolution."  She also presented on "Harmonics Associated with Certain Inverted Spheroids" at the 1932 ICM in Zürich."<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=X7vjCMcM9lQC&dq=On+a+method+for+constructing+harmonics+for+surfaces+of+revolution&pg=PA348 Uneasy Careers and Intimate Lives: Women in Science, 1789–1979]'' edited by Pnina G. Abir-Am, Dorinda Outram, p. 348</ref> The papers she wrote with [[Harold Jeffreys]] on scientific method formed the basis of his 1931 book ''Scientific Inference''. In the ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' obituary Jeffreys wrote, "I should like to put on record my appreciation of the substantial contribution she made to [our joint] work, which is the basis of all my later work on scientific inference."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Harold|date=8 April 1976|title=Dorothy Wrinch|journal=Nature|volume=260|issue=5551|page=564|doi=10.1038/260564a0|bibcode=1976Natur.260..564H|doi-access=free}}</ref>

From about 1932 Wrinch shifted towards theoretical biology. She was one of founders of the Biotheoretical Gathering (aka the 'Theoretical Biology Club'), an inter-disciplinary group that sought to explain life by discovering how [[proteins]] work. Also involved were [[Joseph Henry Woodger]], [[Joseph Needham|Joseph]] and [[Dorothy M. Needham|Dorothy Needham]], [[C. H. Waddington]], [[J. D. Bernal]], [[Karl Popper]] and [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Twentieth Century British Philosophers|author1=Cohen, Alan|date=2005|publisher=Thoemmes|isbn=184371096X|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=Stuart|location=Bristol|page=1183|chapter=Wrinch, Dorothy Maud}}</ref> From then on Wrinch could be described as a theoretical biologist. She developed a model of [[protein structure]], which she called the "[[cyclol]]" structure. The model generated considerable controversy and was attacked by the chemist [[Linus Pauling]]. In these debates Wrinch's lack of training in chemistry was a great weakness. By 1939, evidence had accumulated that the model was wrong but Wrinch continued working on it.  However, experimental work by [[Irving Langmuir]] done in collaboration with Wrinch to validate her ideas catalysed the principle of the [[Hydrophobic effect]] being the driving force for [[protein folding]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tanford C|year=1997|title=How protein chemists learned about the hydrophobic factor|journal=[[Protein Science]]|volume=6|issue=6|pages=1358–1366|doi=10.1002/pro.5560060627|pmc=2143727|pmid=9194199}}</ref>

In 1936 [[Ida Busbridge]] secured a position as assistant to Wrinch from whom she took over mathematics tutorials for all five women’s colleges.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Busbridge, Ida Winifred (1908–1988), mathematician|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-51639|access-date=2020-08-23|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2020|language=en|doi=10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.013.51639|last1=Friedman|first1=E. Clare|isbn=9780198614128}}</ref>

In 1939 Wrinch moved to the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rossiter|first=Margaret W.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8052928|title=Women scientists in America : struggles and strategies to 1940|date=1982|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0-8018-2443-5|location=Baltimore|oclc=8052928}}</ref> She had a variety of teaching positions at three small Massachusetts colleges, [[Amherst College]], [[Smith College]], and [[Mount Holyoke College]]. From 1942 until she retired in 1971 Wrinch held research positions at Smith.

== Personal life ==
Prior to 1918 Wrinch's Cambridge tutor GN Watson had proposed to her but the feeling was not mutual and she had to ask her father to explain this to Watson; nevertheless Watson later recommended Wrinch as his replacement lecturer at University College London.  Around the postwar time of her intellectual closeness to Russell, Wrinch may have had a romantic connection with his brother [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell|Frank]] and probably did have an unhappy attachment with another of his disciples, Raphael Demos. Sources differ on whether Wrinch wanted a romantic relationship with Russell.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Synergy">{{cite book | author-last=Abir-Am | author-first=Pnina G. | editor-last=Abir-Am | editor-first=Pnina G. | editor-last2=Outram | editor-first2=Dorinda |chapter=Synergy or clash: Disciplinary and marital strategies in the career of the mathematical biologist Dorothy M.

It may have been the breaking of their engagement that encouraged Jeffreys to enter psychoanalysis,<ref name=":0" /> which was at the time fashionable in Cambridge.<ref>{{cite book | last=Forrester | first=John | last2=Cameron | first2=Laura | title=Freud in Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | publication-place=Cambridge, United Kingdom | year=2017 | isbn=978-1-316-85009-1 | oclc=974915127}}</ref>

In 1922 Wrinch married her graduate supervisor at King's College London, the mathematical physicist John William Nicholson. The examination for her DSc in 1921 had, unusually, an additional referee, which may have been because of perceptions of a relationship between the two of them. Nicholson was a graduate of Owens College Manchester and also a Cambridge Wrangler. In 1921 he was elected into a Fellowship at [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. The couple had one child, Pamela, born in 1927. Wrinch's book on parenthood, ''Retreat from Parenthood'' (1930) published under the pseudonym Jean Ayling and dedicated to Russell, was a venture into public health rather than a manual of child-care, propounding ideas of societal reorganisation to make child rearing more compatible with professional life. Nicholson's mental health deteriorated in the late 1920s, and in 1930 he was certified as mentally ill and confined in the Warneford Hospital until his death in 1955. In 1937 Wrinch was granted a divorce on grounds of her husband's insanity.<ref name="creese" /> From 1930 Wrinch was close emotionally and intellectually to the mathematician [[Eric Harold Neville|Eric Neville]] in a friendship which lasted until 1961.

In 1939 Wrinch and her daughter moved to the United States, partly because the chancellor of Oxford University and Foreign Secretary [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] advised her she would be most useful to the war effort by research and lecturing there.<ref name=":0" /> In 1941 she married [[Otto C. Glaser|Otto Charles Glaser]], chairman of the biology department and vice-president of [[Amherst College]], and it was in part through him that she was able to obtain teaching positions. In 1944 Glaser was forced to resign as chairman because he had allowed his research assistant to spend time working for Wrinch. Glaser retired in 1948 and died in 1951.<ref name=":0" />

Wrinch died in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts]] on 11 February 1976.

[[Dorothy Hodgkin]] wrote in Wrinch's obituary that she was "a brilliant and controversial figure who played a part in the beginnings of much of present research in molecular biology."<ref>{{cite news|title=Dorothy Wrinch, Biochemist, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/15/archives/dorothy-wrinch-biochemist-dies-crystallographer-81-was-a.html?|work=The New York Times|date=15 February 1976|page=67|access-date=February 13, 2022}}</ref> On a more personal level, Hodgkin wrote, "I like to think of her as she was when I first knew her, gay, enthusiastic and adventurous, courageous in face of much misfortune and very kind."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crowfoot Hodgkin|first1=Dorothy|title=Dorothy Wrinch|journal=Nature|date=8 April 1976|volume=260|issue=5551|page=564|doi=10.1038/260564a0|bibcode=1976Natur.260..564H|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== ''The Retreat from Parenthood'' (1930) ==
Wrinch's book first summarizes the impact of having children on women’s  careers, which often included termination for professional women, and the psychological and physical impact on parents and children caused by leaving to most parents practically all functions necessary to raise a child. Of special concern to her was the fact that parents generally lack the necessary expertise in practical matters like the suitable diet and social environment best-suited for a child's development, since their professional expertise is often in other areas, and that scientifically understanding these matters requires a great deal of a parent's time (away from their career).

The book next offers a constructive solution to this problem. Wrinch proposed that there should be Child Rearing Services that assume from parents nearly every aspect of raising the child, except in four areas where a parent's involvement is absolutely crucial: "impregnation," "gestation," "childbirth," and "lactation." The Child Rearing Services (C.R.S.) would be divided into four bureaus, A, B, C, and D. The C.R.S.A. would deal with refitting homes so as to make them more comfortable and hospitable to child rearing, providing services like electrical work, plumbing services and repairs, insulation and soundproofing, and reliable hot water. The C.R.S.B. the labor of child rearing like changing diapers, preparing meals, laundry, cleaning dishes, and so on. The C.R.S.C. would deal with food safety, inspection, diet, and delivery, with a focus on ensuring that each child was well-nourished and given the best possible diet. The C.R.S.D. would deal with all medical, nursing, psychological, and other services necessary for the health and well-being of parents and child, from pregnancy to the school door.<ref name=":0" />
