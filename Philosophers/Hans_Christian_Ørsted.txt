'''Hans Christian Ørsted''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|ForMemRS|FRSE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɜːr|s|t|ɛ|d}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/oersted "Oersted"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA|da|ˈhænˀs ˈkʰʁestjæn ˈɶɐ̯steð|lang|Da-Ørsted.oga}}; often rendered '''Oersted''' in English{{notetag|Depending on orthography and editorial convention, it may also be rendered '''Orsted''' or '''Örsted'''.}}; 14 August 1777{{spaced ndash}}9 March 1851) was a Danish [[physicist]] and [[chemist]] who discovered that [[electric current]]s create [[magnetic field]]s. This phenomenon is called [[Oersted's law]] and the [[oersted]] unit (Oe) is named after him.

A leader of the [[Danish Golden Age]], Ørsted was a close friend of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and the brother of politician and jurist [[Anders Sandøe Ørsted]], who served as [[Prime Minister of Denmark]] from 1853 to 1854.

==Early life and studies==
[[File:Hans Christian Ørsted som ung.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ørsted as a youth]]
Ørsted was born in [[Rudkøbing]] in 1777. As a young boy he developed an interest in science while working for his father, who was a pharmacist in the [[Rudkøbing Pharmacy|town's pharmacy]].<ref name="dsd">{{cite web |last1=Jacobsen |first1=A. S. |last2=Knudsen |first2=O. |title=H.C. Ørsted |url=https://denstoredanske.lex.dk/H.C._%C3%98rsted |website=Den Store Danske |publisher=Gyldendal |language=da |date=14 April 2021 |access-date=12 April 2023}}</ref> He and his brother [[Anders Sandøe Ørsted|Anders]] received most of their early education through self-study at home, going to Copenhagen in 1793 to take entrance exams for the [[University of Copenhagen]], where both brothers excelled academically. By 1796, Ørsted had been awarded honors for his papers in both [[aesthetics]] and [[physics]]. He earned his doctorate in 1799 for a dissertation based on the works of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] entitled ''The Architectonics of Natural Metaphysics''.

In 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] reported his invention of the [[voltaic pile]], which inspired Ørsted to investigate the nature of electricity and to conduct his first electrical experiments. In 1801, Ørsted received a travel [[scholarship]] and public grant which enabled him to spend three years traveling across Europe. He toured science headquarters throughout the continent, including in Berlin and Paris.<ref>{{cite web |title=Inspiration fra Europa – planer i København |date=27 February 2023 |trans-title=Inspiration from Europe – Plans in Copenhagen |url=https://nbi.ku.dk/hhh/hco/oersted/uddannelsen/ |publisher=Niels Bohr Institutet, Københavns Universitet |access-date=12 April 2023 |language=da}}</ref>

In Germany, Ørsted met [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]], a physicist who believed there was a connection between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. This idea made sense to Ørsted as he subscribed to [[Kantianism|Kantian]] thought regarding the [[Natural philosophy|unity of nature]].<ref name="dsd" /><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Brain |editor1-first=R. M. |editor2-last=Cohen |editor2-first=R.

He became a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1806 and continued research on electric currents and acoustics. Under his guidance the university developed a comprehensive physics and chemistry program and established new laboratories. {{Citation needed|date=April 2023}}

Ørsted welcomed [[William Christopher Zeise]] to his family home in autumn 1806. He granted Zeise a position as his lecturing assistant and took the young chemist under his tutelage. In 1812, Ørsted again visited Germany and France after publishing {{lang|da|Videnskaben om Naturens Almindelige Love}} and {{lang|da|Første Indledning til den Almindelige Naturlære}} (1811).

Ørsted was the first modern thinker to explicitly describe and name the [[thought experiment]]. He used the Latin-German term {{lang|de|Gedankenexperiment}} circa 1812 and the German term {{lang|de|Gedankenversuch}} in 1820.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Witt-Hansen |first1=J. |title=H.C. Ørsted, Immanuel Kant, and the Thought Experiment |journal=Danish Yearbook of Philosophy |date=1976 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=48–65 |doi=10.1163/24689300-01301004 |issn=0070-2749}}</ref>

In 1819 Ørsted was the first to extract [[piperine]] and subsequently name it. He extracted it from ''[[Piper nigrum]]'', the plant from which both white and black pepper comes from.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ørsted |first=Hans Christian |author-link=Hans Christian Ørsted |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k-M4AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA80 |title=Über das Piperin, ein neues Pflanzenalkaloid|language=de |trans-title=On piperine, a new plant alkaloid |journal=Schweiggers Journal für Chemie und Physik |volume= 29 |issue= 1 |pages=80–82 |date=1820}}</ref>

Ørsted designed a new type of [[piezometer]] to measure the compressibility of liquids in 1822.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aitken |first1=F. |last2=Foulc |first2=J.-N. |title=From Tait's Work on the Compressibility of Seawater to Equations-of-State for Liquids |series=From Deep Sea to Laboratory |volume=3 |date=2019 |publisher=ISTE |location=London |isbn=978-1-78630-376-9 |doi=10.1002/9781119663362|s2cid=204258765 }}</ref>

==Electromagnetism==
[[File:17. Естердов експеримент.ogv|thumb|A compass needle with a wire, showing the effect Ørsted discovered.]]
{{electromagnetism|Scientists}}

In 1820, Ørsted published his discovery that a [[compass]] needle was deflected from magnetic north by a nearby electric current, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.<ref name="Fahie">{{cite book |last1=Fahie |first1=J. J. |title=A History of Electric Telegraphy to the Year 1837 |date=1884 |publisher=E. & F. N.

He had, in fact, been looking for a connection between electricity and magnetism since 1818, but was quite confused{{how so|date=July 2024}} by the results he was obtaining.<ref name=Martins>{{cite book |last1=Martins |first1=R.

His initial interpretation was that magnetic effects radiate from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current, as do light and heat. Three months later, he began more intensive investigations and soon thereafter published his findings, showing that an electric current produces a circular magnetic field as it flows through a wire.<ref name="annals" /><ref name="Martins" /> For his discovery, the [[Royal Society of London]] awarded Ørsted the [[Copley Medal]] in 1820 and the French Academy granted him 3,000 [[French francs|francs]].

Ørsted's findings stirred much research into electrodynamics throughout the scientific community, influencing French physicist [[André-Marie Ampère]]'s developments of a single mathematical formula to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. Ørsted's work also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.

The Ørsted effect brought about a communications revolution due to its application to the [[electric telegraph]].  The possibility of such a telegraph was suggested almost immediately by mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and Ampère presented a paper based on Laplace's idea the same year as Ørsted's discovery.<ref name="Fahie" />{{rp|302–303}} However, it was almost two decades before it became a commercial reality.

He founded the {{ill|Selskabet for Naturlærens Udbredelse|da}} (Society for the Dissemination of Natural Science, SNU) in 1824. He was also the founder of predecessor organizations which eventually became the [[Danish Meteorological Institute]] and the [[European Patent Organisation|Danish Patent and Trademark Office]]. In 1829, Ørsted founded {{lang|da|[[Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt]]|italic=no}} (College of Advanced Technology), which was later renamed the [[Technical University of Denmark]] (DTU).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dtu.dk/English/About_DTU/History_of_DTU.aspx |title=History of DTU |publisher=Danmarks Tekniske Universitet |place=Kongens Lyngby |access-date=2009-08-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902070101/http://www.dtu.dk/English/About_DTU/History_of_DTU.aspx |archive-date=2009-09-02}}</ref>

The [[CGS|centimetre-gram-second system (CGS)]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] ([[oersted]]) is named for his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.

The company Danish Oil and Natural Gas (DONG), was renamed [[Ørsted (company)|Ørsted]] to signal its transition from [[fossil fuels]] to becoming one the world's leading developers and operators of [[offshore windfarms]].

The [[Ørsted (satellite)|first Danish satellite]], launched in 1999, was named after Ørsted.

===Toponymy===
The [[Ørstedsparken|Ørsted Park]] in Copenhagen was named after Ørsted and his brother in 1879. The streets {{lang|da|[[H. C. Ørsteds Vej]]|italic=no}} in [[Frederiksberg]] and {{lang|da|H. C. Ørsteds Allé|italic=no}} in [[Galten, Denmark|Galten]] are also named after him.

The buildings that are home to the [[University of Copenhagen Department of Chemistry|Department of Chemistry]] and the [[University of Copenhagen Institute for Mathematical Sciences|Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]]'s [[North Campus (University of Copenhagen)|North Campus]] are named the [[Hans Christian Ørsted Institute|H.C. Ørsted Institute]], after him. A dormitory named {{lang|da|H. C. Ørsted Kollegiet|italic=no}} is located in [[Odense]].

===Monuments and memorials===
[[File:Statue of Hans Christian Øersted, Øerstedsparken, Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statue of Ørsted in [[Ørstedsparken]], in Copenhagen.]]
A [[The Physicist Hans Christian Ørsted|statue of Hans Christian Ørsted]] was installed in the Ørsted Park in 1880. A commemorative plaque is located above the gate on the building in {{lang|da|[[Studiestræde]]|italic=no}} where he lived and worked.

In 1885, a statue of Ørsted was installed in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]].

Ørsted's likeness has appeared twice on [[Danish krone#Banknotes|Danish banknotes]]; for the first time on 500{{nbsp}}kroner notes issued in 1875, and for the second time on 100{{nbsp}}kroner notes issued between 1962 and 1974.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sedler og Mønter: Portræt- og Landskabsserien |trans-title=Notes and Coins: The Portrait and Landscape Series |url=https://www.nationalbanken.dk/da/sedlerogmoenter/danske_pengesedler_tidligere/Sider/Portr%C3%A6t--og-landskabsserien.aspx |publisher=Danmarks Nationalbank |place=København |access-date=20 March 2023 |date=10 February 2014 |language=da}}</ref>

===Awards and lectures===
Two medals are awarded in Ørsted's name: the [[H. C. Ørsted Medal]] for Danish scientists, awarded by the Danish Society for the Dissemination of Natural Science (SNU), as founded by Ørsted, and the [[Oersted Medal]] for notable contributions in the teaching of physics in America, awarded by [[American Association of Physics Teachers]].
