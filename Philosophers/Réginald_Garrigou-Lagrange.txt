}}</ref> As professor at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]], he taught dogmatic and spiritual theology in Rome from 1909 to 1959. There he wrote ''[[The Three Ages of the Interior Life]]'' (''Les trois âges de la vie intérieure)'' in 1938.

==Life==
Gontran-Marie Garrigou Lagrange was born in [[Auch]], near [[Toulouse]], France on 21 February 1877. His father François Garrigou-Lagrange, was a civil servant. Lagrange was the relative of Henri Lasserre, a historian, through his mother, Cleménce Lasserre and his paternal grand-uncle was [[Maurice-Marie-Matthieu Garrigou]]. Although Lagrange's family was Catholic, the young boy didn't show signs of remarkable piety as was seen in the late nineteenth century of those who would later become saints.

He went to many different schools but one of them was the lycée at Tarbes in which he studied philosophy for about a year. While studying at Tarbes, he wrote an essay on the problem of pain, in the essay he mentions the intellectual, moral and artistic advantages of suffering, but not the religious significance of suffering.<ref name=":0" /> After completing his final years in school, he began apprehending a vocation in medicine and thus he commenced his medical studies at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1896. While studying medicine at [[University of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], he experienced what he described as a religious conversion after reading ''Life, Science, and Art'' by the Breton writer [[Ernest Hello]] (1828–85). He would later recall to his Dominican confrere, Rosaire Gagnebet:  {{blockquote|I was able to glimpse how the doctrine of the Catholic Church is the absolute Truth concerning God and his intimate life and concerning the human person, his origin and his supernatural destiny. I saw in a wink of an eye that it was not a truth relative to our time and place but an absolute truth that will not change but will become more and more apparent up to the time when we see God face to face. A ray of light shone before my eyes and made clear the words of the Lord: "The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away." I understood that this truth must bear fruit like the grain of wheat in good soil..."<ref>The Sacred Monster of Thomism by Richard Peddicord

===Friar===
Lagrange went through a discernment process, which led him to discern many religious orders but culminated in him joining the [[Dominican Order]]; he joined the Dominicans of the Paris province at Amiens in the fall of 1897. Father Constant, a novice master, who plausibly educated Garrigou during his time in the novitiate, was renowned to be an austere friar, but "one who greatly loved the Order and knew how to lead others to love it." In the Dominican Order, it was requisite for a novice to become a priest to continue his journey as a friar, thus after he finished his novitiate the young novice went to the studium in Flavigny to begin his philosophical and theological studies under {{ill|Ambroise Gardeil|fr}} to prepare for the priesthood. Lagrange and Gardeil shared a close relationship which would last until Gardeil died in 1938. Lagrange was ordained a priest on September 28, 1902.

While at the Sorbonne, Garrigou was able to attend lectures that included Emile Durkheim, [[Gabriel Séailles]], and Lucien Levy-Bruhl; later in life, he would recall that he had been present at a lecture where Alfred Loisy rehearsed his trademark theme; "Jesus preached the kingdom of God, and it was the Church that came". As fate would have it, it was at the Sorbonne in which Garrigou would meet the young Bergsonian –  destined to become a major proponent of Thomism – Jacques Maritain where they would have a good relationship throughout the 1930s to 1940s. While Garrigou was teaching the history of philosophy, the studium moved many times because of the anti-clerical laws of the administration of Emile Combes, which affected Garrigou's political outlook.

In 1906, the deteriorating health of Etienne Hugueny caused him to resign from his post and Garrigou was called to ascend to the chair of dogmatic theology at Le Saulchoir. This change was a decisive moment in Garrigou's life which would allow him to devote himself to the study of philosophy which he would relish. As a subsequent result of this change, Garrigou commenced his approfondissement (in-depth study) in the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas and other Thomists who would guide him throughout his life. It was here where Garrigou wrote his first book, ''Le sens commun, la philosophie de l'être et les formules dogmatiques'', a critique of Eduard Le Roy's attempt to interpret the dogmas of the church with a Bergsonian hermeneutic which led Le Roy to downplay the Church's emphasis on radical dogmatic continuity throughout history. In 1909, Master General Hyacinthe Cormier recognized his abilities and assigned him to the Angelicum where he continued teaching dogmatic theology until his retirement in 1959. In 1917 a special professorship in ascetical and mystical theology was created for him at the ''Angelicum'', the first of its kind anywhere in the world.<ref name="CoulterMyers2012">{{cite book|author1=Michael L.

=== Death ===
As Garrigou began to lose energy, he was moved to the priory of Santa Sabina in Rome subsequently moved to the Fraternitè Sacerdotale Canadienne and died there on 15 February 1964. Benoît Lavaud said:

{{blockquote|He leaves us in parting, along with his monumental written oeuvre, an admirable example of religious life and of fidelity to his vocation, to work and to the love of the truth, to apostolic zeal, docility to the Church, to abandon to the will of the Lord whom he served for so long and who just called him to Himself: Euge, serve bone."<ref>Lavaud, 'Le Pere Garrigou-Lagrange," 199</ref>}}

==Thought==
He is best known for his spiritual theology. His ''magnum opus'' in the field is ''[[The Three Ages of the Interior Life]]'' (Les trois ages de la vie int''é''rieure),<ref>[http://www.christianperfection.info/ ''The Three Ages of the Interior Life''] Online text.</ref> in which he propounded the thesis that infused [[contemplation]] and the resulting [[mysticism|mystical]] life are in the normal way of holiness of [[Christianity|Christian]] perfection. This influenced the section entitled "Chapter V: The Universal Call to Holiness in the Church" in the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, ''[[Lumen gentium]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hprweb.com/2009/04/rehabilitation-of-garrigou-lagrange/|title=Rehabilitation of Garrigou-Lagrange|author=Mullady, Brian|date=2 April 2009|access-date=2012-07-26}}</ref>

He synthesized the highly abstract writings of [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]] with the experiential writings of [[John of the Cross|St. John of the Cross]], attempting to show they are in perfect harmony with each other.<ref>"A saint in Heaven", by Fr. Thomas Crean, http://www.christendom-awake.org/pages/thomas-crean/saint-in-heaven.htm Accessed 4-10-2012</ref>

Father Garrigou-Lagrange, the leading proponent of "strict observance [[Thomism]]", attracted wider attention when in 1946 he wrote against the ''[[Nouvelle théologie]]'' theological movement, criticizing elements of it as [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|Modernist]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Garrigou-Lagrange |first=Reginald |date=1946 |title=La nouvelle théologie où va-t-elle ? |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44622585?searchText=La%20nouvelle%20th%C3%A9ologie%20o%C3%B9%20va-t-elle&searchUri=/action/doBasicSearch?Query=La+nouvelle+th%25C3%25A9ologie+o%25C3%25B9+va-t-elle%253F&so=rel&ab_segments=0/basic_search_gsv2/control&refreqid=fastly-default:5614b9ad526605cf9f2444a2be89bfdf |journal=[[Angelicum (journal)|Angelicum]] |volume=23 |issue=3/4 |pages=126–145 |issn=1123-5772}}</ref>

He is also said to be the drafter of [[Pope Pius XII]]'s 1950 [[Papal encyclical|encyclical]] ''[[Humani generis]]'', subtitled "Concerning Some False Opinions Threatening to Undermine the Foundations of Catholic Doctrine".<ref>"No one has ever found a 'smoking gun' proving that Garrigou-Lagrange shared in ghost-writing ''Humani generis'' or has ever fixed his exact contribution. But, as noted above, it is plain that he had a major role in its gestation." "Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange: Defending the Faith from ''Pascendi dominici gregis'' to ''Humani generis''",  Michael Kerlin, ''US Catholic Historian'', Vol. 25, No. 1, Winter, 2007, 111.<!--

In politics, like many neo-scholastic theologians of his time, Garrigou-Lagrange was a strong supporter of the far-right movement ''[[Action Française]]'' and he also sympathized with [[Vichy France]]. In 1941 he praised the [[Collaboration with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy|French collaborationist]] regime and its Chief of State [[Pétain]] in a letter written to his former disciple [[Jacques Maritain]]: "I am entirely with the [[List of Marshals of France|Marshal]], I see him as the Father of the ''patrie'', blessed with a good sense verging on genius, and as a truly providential man".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shortall |first=Sarah |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ps8EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA93 |title=Soldiers of God in a Secular World: Catholic Theology and Twentieth-Century |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2021 |isbn=9780674269613 |page=93}}</ref>

==Influence==
''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' of 9–10 December 1950 lists Garrigou-Lagrange among the names of the preparatory commission for the definition of the [[Assumption of Mary]].<ref>[http://www.ts.mu.edu/readers/content/pdf/12/12.4/12.4.4.pdf Accessed 2-6-2013]</ref>

Garrigou-Lagrange taught many Catholic theologians during his academic career at the ''Angelicum''. He also supervised the doctoral research of [[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], who was ordained in 1919 and completed his doctorate in theology in 1920 with a dissertation entitled ''De contemplatione''.<ref>Praeambula Fidei: Thomism And the God of the Philosophers, Ralph McInerny, 2006, https://books.google.com/books?id=3FY1gtVu37sC&pg=PA108 Accessed 24 May 2012; Nouvelle Théologie and Sacramental Ontology: A Return to Mystery, Hans Boersma, 2009, 136 https://books.google.com/books?id=514HmFl5y9AC&pg=PA136 Accessed 24 May 2012</ref> In the period between World War II and the Cold War Garrigou-Lagrange was the "torchbearer of orthodox [[Thomism]]" against Modernism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/le-eredita-2-i-postumi-della-crisi-modernista_(Cristiani-d'Italia)/ |title=Treccani - la cultura italiana &#124; Treccani, il portale del sapere |website=www.treccani.it |access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref>  In 1926 he served as the definitive consulter to [[Pope Pius XI]] in declaring [[John of the Cross]] a doctor of the church.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avvenire.it/Cultura/Pagine/il-tomista-assalto.aspx |title=Garrigou-Lagrange .

He is commonly held to have influenced the decision in 1942 to place the privately circulated book ''Une école de théologie: le Saulchoir'' (Étiolles 1937) by [[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], [[Dominican Order|O.P.]], on the Vatican's ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' as the culmination of a polemic within the [[Dominican Order]] between the ''Angelicum'' supporters of speculative scholasticism and the French revival Thomists who were more attentive to historical hermeneutics.<ref>http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/le-eredita-2-i-postumi-della-crisi-modernista_(Cristiani-d'Italia)/ Accessed 10 September 2013; Y.

Garrigou-Lagrange gave the retreat in Paris which attracted [[Yves Congar]] to leave the diocesan seminary in order to join the Dominicans.<ref>Fergus Kerr, ''Twentieth-Century Catholic Theologians'', (Blackwell, 2007), p10.</ref> Later, Congar's methodology was suspected of Modernism because it seemed to derive more from religious experience than from syllogistic analysis.<ref>http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/le-eredita-2-i-postumi-della-crisi-modernista_(Cristiani-d'Italia)/ Accessed 10 September 2013; Y.

Garrigou-Lagrange also supervised the doctoral research of [[Maurice Zundel]] who completed his dissertation in 1927 with a dissertation entitled ''L'Influence du nominalisme sur la pensée chrétienne''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annesigier.qc.ca/zundel/biographie.html |title=Maurice Zundel: Biographie |access-date=2013-08-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825085028/http://www.annesigier.qc.ca/zundel/biographie.html |archive-date=2013-08-25 }} Accessed 26 August 2013</ref>

Perhaps the most famous of his students was the future [[Pope John Paul II]], who was supervised by Garrigou-Lagrange for his doctoral research in the mid-1940s at the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas|''Angelicum'']], and whose [[Papal encyclical|encyclical]] ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' is attributed to his training under Garrigou-Lagrange.

Garrigou-Lagrange died on 15 February 1964 in Rome. The International Dominican Foundation (IDF) established Réginald de Rocquois Foundation in his memory at Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas where he taught most of his career, which grants annual Réginald de Rocquois scholarships.<ref>{{cite web |title=IDF Serving the Dominican Order and the Church|publisher=IDF News, International Dominican Foundation| url = http://internationaldominicanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IDF_newsletter_july2012.pdf|date=July 2012| access-date = 2014-07-23 }}</ref>
