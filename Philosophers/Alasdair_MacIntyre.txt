==Biography==
MacIntyre was born on 12 January 1929 in [[Glasgow]], to Eneas and Greta (Chalmers) MacIntyre. He was educated at [[Queen Mary College, London]], and has a [[Master of Arts]] degree from the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] and from the [[University of Oxford]]. He began his teaching career in 1951 at Manchester. He married Ann Peri, with whom he had two daughters, Jean and Toni.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Hauerwas|first=Stanley |title= The Virtues of Alasdair MacIntyre |url= http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/10/004-the-virtues-of-alasdair-macintyre | journal = First Things|access-date= 16 June 2014|date=October 2007}}</ref> He taught at the [[University of Leeds]], the [[University of Essex]] and the [[University of Oxford]] in the United Kingdom, before moving to the US in around 1969. MacIntyre has been something of an intellectual nomad, having taught at many universities in the US. He has held the following positions:
*Professor of History of Ideas, [[Brandeis University]] (1969 or 1970),
* Dean of the College of Arts and professor of philosophy, [[Boston University]] (1972),
*[[Henry Luce]] Professor, [[Wellesley College]] (1980),
*W. Alton Jones Professor, [[Vanderbilt University]] (1982),
*Professor of Philosophy, [[University of Notre Dame]] (1985),
*Professor of Philosophy, [[Vanderbilt University]] (1985),
*Visiting scholar, Whitney Humanities Center, [[Yale University]] (1988),
*McMahon-Hank Professor of Philosophy, [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] (1989), and
*Arts & Sciences Professor of Philosophy, [[Duke University]] (1995–1997).
He has also been a visiting professor at [[Princeton University]] and is a former president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. In 2010, he was awarded the Aquinas Medal by the [[American Catholic Philosophical Association]]. He is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (elected 1985), the [[British Academy]] (1994), the [[Royal Irish Academy]] (1999), and the [[American Philosophical Society]] (2005).

From 2000 he was the Rev. John A. O'Brien Senior Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy (emeritus since 2010) at the [[University of Notre Dame]], [[Indiana]], US. He is also professor emerit and emeritus at [[Duke University]]. In July 2010 he became senior research fellow at [[London Metropolitan University]]'s Centre for Contemporary Aristotelian Studies in Ethics and Politics. Since his retirement from active teaching in 2010, he remains the senior distinguished research fellow of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/people/fellows/research/ | title=Permanent Senior Distinguished Research Fellows // De Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture // University of Notre Dame | access-date=21 May 2016 | archive-date=7 January 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107174512/http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/people/fellows/research/ | url-status=dead }}</ref> where he retains an office. He continues to make public presentations, including an annual keynote as part of the Center for Ethics and Culture's Fall Conference.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fall Conference | publisher = Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture | url = http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/programs/fall-conference/}}.</ref>

He has been married three times. From 1953 to 1963 he was married to Ann Peri, with whom he had two daughters. From 1963 to 1977 he was married to former teacher and now poet Susan Willans, with whom he had a son and daughter. Since 1977 he has been married to philosopher Lynn Joy, who is also on the philosophy faculty at Notre Dame.

==Philosophical approach==
MacIntyre's approach to moral philosophy interweaves a number of complex strands. Although he largely aims to revive an Aristotelian moral philosophy based on the virtues, he claims a "peculiarly modern understanding" of this task.<ref>''After Virtue'', (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 3rd edn, 2007) xii.</ref>

This "peculiarly modern understanding" largely concerns MacIntyre's approach to moral disputes. Unlike some [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]s who try to generate moral consensus on the basis of [[rationality]], MacIntyre uses the historical development of ethics to circumvent the modern problem of "incommensurable" moral notions, whose merits cannot be compared in any common framework. Following [[Hegel]] and [[R. G. Collingwood|Collingwood]], he offers a "philosophical history" (as opposed to analytical and phenomenological approaches) in which he concedes from the beginning that "there are no neutral standards available by appeal to which any rational agent whatsoever could determine" the conclusions of moral philosophy.<ref>''After Virtue'', 3, xiii.</ref>

In his most famous work, ''[[After Virtue]]'', he deprecates the attempt of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers to deduce a universal rational morality independent of [[teleology]], whose failure led to the rejection of moral rationality altogether by successors such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Charles Stevenson (philosopher)|Charles Stevenson]]. He emphasizes how this overestimation of reason led to Nietzsche's utter repudiation of the possibility of moral rationality.<ref>''After Virtue'', 257</ref>

By contrast, MacIntyre attempts to reclaim more modest forms of moral rationality and argumentation which claim neither finality nor logical certainty, but which can hold up against [[Moral relativism|relativistic]] or [[Emotivism|emotivist]] denials of any moral rationality whatsoever (the mistaken conclusion of Nietzsche, Sartre, and Stevenson). He revives the tradition of [[Aristotelian ethics]] with its teleological account of the good and of moral actions, as fulfilled in the medieval writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. This [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]-[[Thomism|Thomistic]] tradition, he proposes, presents "the best theory so far," both of how things are and how we ought to act.

More generally, according to MacIntyre, moral disputes always take place within and between rival traditions of thought relying on an inherited store of ideas, presuppositions, types of arguments and shared understandings and approaches. Even though there is no definitive way for one tradition in moral philosophy to logically refute another, nevertheless opposing views can dispute each other's internal coherence, resolution of imaginative dilemmas and [[Epistemology|epistemic]] crises, and achievement of fruitful results.<ref>''After Virtue'', xii–xiii</ref>

==Major writings==

===''After Virtue'' (1981)===
{{main|After Virtue}}
{{Communitarianism sidebar}}
Probably his most widely read work, ''After Virtue'' was written when MacIntyre was already in his fifties. Up to then, MacIntyre had been a relatively influential [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] of a [[Marxism|Marxist]] bent whose moral inquiries had been conducted in a "piecemeal way, focusing first on this problem and then on that, in a mode characteristic of much analytic philosophy."<ref>''The Tasks of Philosophy: Selected Essays, Vol. 1'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006) viii</ref> However, after reading the works of [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Imre Lakatos]] on [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]], MacIntyre was inspired to change the entire direction of his thought, tearing up the manuscript he had been working on and deciding to view the problems of modern moral and [[political philosophy]] "not from the standpoint of liberal [[modernity]], but instead from the standpoint of… Aristotelian moral and political practice."<ref name= "Tasks_viii">''The Tasks of Philosophy: Selected Essays, Vol. 1'', viii.</ref>

In general terms, the task of ''After Virtue'' is to account both for the dysfunction of modern moral discourse in modern society and to rehabilitate the alternative of teleological rationality in Aristotelian [[virtue ethics]]. MacIntyre's [[philippic]] articulates a politics of self-defence for local communities who aspire to protect their traditional way of life from the corrosive capitalist [[Market economy|free market]].<ref name= "BlackledgeKnight2011">{{cite book| first1 =Paul | last1 = Blackledge| first2 =Kelvin | last2 = Knight|title=Virtue and Politics: Alasdair MacIntyre's Revolutionary Aristotelianism |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mfpLYgEACAAJ |access-date= 21 December 2012 |date= 15 June 2011 |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |isbn= 978-0-268-02225-9 |page= 31}}</ref>

===''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'' (1988)===
{{main|Whose Justice? Which Rationality?}}

MacIntyre's second major work of his mature period takes up the problem of giving an account of philosophical rationality within the context of his notion of "traditions," which had still remained under-theorized in ''After Virtue''. Specifically, MacIntyre argues that rival and largely incompatible conceptions of justice are the outcome of rival and largely incompatible forms of practical rationality. These competing forms of practical rationality and their attendant ideas of justice are in turn the result of "socially embodied traditions of rational inquiry."<ref>"Précis of Whose Justice? Which Rationality?" in ''MacIntyre Reader'', ed. Kelvin Knight (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1998) 107.</ref> Although MacIntyre's treatment of traditions is quite complex he does give a relatively concise definition: "A tradition is an argument extended through time in which certain fundamental agreements are defined and redefined" in terms of both internal and external debates.<ref>''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'' (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1988) 12.</ref>

Much of ''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'' is therefore engaged in the task of not only giving the reader examples of what MacIntyre considers actual rival traditions and the different ways they can split apart, integrate, or defeat one another (e.g. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]], [[Thomism|Thomist]], [[Humeanism#Practical reason|Humean]]) but also with substantiating how practical rationality and a conception of justice help constitute those traditions. Specifically, according to him, the differing accounts of justice that are presented by Aristotle and Hume are due to the underlying differences in their [[conceptual scheme]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = MacIntyre | first1 = A. | title = Précis of Whose Justice?

Which Rationality?'', 361–362.</ref>

MacIntyre's account also defends three further theses: first, that all rational human inquiry is conducted whether knowingly or not from within a tradition; second, that the incommensurable conceptual schemes of rival traditions do not entail either [[relativism]] or [[perspectivism]]; third, that although the arguments of the book are themselves attempts at universally valid insights they are nevertheless given from within a particular tradition (that of Thomist Aristotelianism) and that this need not imply any philosophical inconsistency.

===''Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry'' (1990)===
''Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry'' was first presented by MacIntyre as part of the Gifford lecture series at the University of Edinburgh in 1988 and is considered by many the third part in a trilogy of philosophical argumentation that commenced with ''After Virtue''. As its title implies, MacIntyre's aim in this book is to examine three major rival traditions of moral inquiry on the intellectual scene today (encyclopaedic, genealogical and traditional) which each in turn was given defence from a canonical piece published in the late nineteenth century (the Ninth Edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality|Genealogy of Morals]]'' and [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'', respectively).<ref>De George, Richard T. (1991) "Alasdair MacIntyre, [https://place.asburyseminary.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1345&context=faithandphilosophy THREE RIVAL VERSIONS OF MORAL ENQUIRY: ENCYCLOPAEDIA, GENEALOGY, AND TRADITION]," Faith and Philosophy: Journal of the Society of Christian Philosophers: Vol. 8 : Iss. 4 , Article 7. doi:10.5840/faithphil19918442, p. 541</ref>

MacIntyre's book ultimately conducts a complex series of both [[Immanent critique|interior]] and exterior critiques of the encyclopaedic and genealogical positions in an attempt to vindicate philosophical [[Thomism]] as the most persuasive form of moral inquiry currently on offer. His critique in chapter IX of Nietzsche's and [[Michel Foucault]]'s genealogical mode as implicitly committed to an emancipatory and continuous notion of self which they cannot account for on their own terms has been of particular influence.

The tradition-bound account of rational inquiry MacIntyre articulates and deploys throughout these lectures suggests reforms, which he explores in chapter X, both for the lecture as a genre and for the university as an institution, outlining the concept of a "postliberal university of constrained disagreement".
To advance rational inquiry, MacIntyre argues that lectures ought to take account of the tradition-constituted roles both of lecturer and of student. Lecturers as members of explicitly articulated traditions should engage students, recognized as standing in various relationships to the lecturer's own and/or rival traditions, on material situated in the historically contextualised progress of the lecturer's home tradition. In support of such lectures and of tradition-bound inquiry on the research front, universities should become forums for growing and engaging rival traditions. For students, such forums would invite intentional formation within a tradition, and support learning how to profitably confront rival traditions through imaginative participation in them. For researchers, inquiry at the frontier must advance toward holistic, inter-disciplinary accounts, at once both theoretical and practical, undertaken together by members of communities of practitioners bound together in traditions. Such tradition-bound inquiry contributes to the advancement of researchers' host traditions on their own terms. Moreover, undertaking such inquiry in a reformed university setting would support encounters among host traditions and their rivals, and thus visibility as traditions both to themselves and to others through imaginative engagement with rival perspectives. The public hosting of such engagements at suitably-reformed universities, including opportunities for agreement from complementary perspectives and for sharpening differences, would support both adjudication among the mutual claims to rational superiority among rival traditions, and initiation of students into the skill sets required to profitably join and assess such encounters.

===''Dependent Rational Animals'' (1999)===

While ''After Virtue'' attempted to give an account of the virtues exclusively by recourse to social practices and the understanding of individual selves in light of "quests" and "traditions," ''Dependent Rational Animals'' was a self-conscious effort by MacIntyre to ground virtues in an account of biology. MacIntyre writes the following of this shift in the preface to the book: "Although there is indeed good reason to repudiate important elements in Aristotle's biology, I now judge that I was in error in supposing an ethics independent of biology to be possible."<ref>''Dependent Rational Animals'' (Chicago: Carus Publishing, 1999) x</ref>

More specifically, ''Dependent Rational Animals'' tries to make a [[Holism|holistic]] case on the basis of our best current knowledge (as opposed to an ahistorical, foundational claim) that "human vulnerability and disability" are the "central features of human life" and that Thomistic "virtues of dependency" are needed for individual human beings to flourish in their passage from stages of infancy to adulthood and old age.<ref name="Tasks_viii" /> As MacIntyre puts it: <blockquote>
It is most often to others that we owe our survival, let alone our flourishing ... It will be a central thesis of this book that the virtues that we need, if we are to develop from our animal condition into that of independent rational agents, and the virtues that we need, if we are to confront and respond to vulnerability and disability both in ourselves and in others, belong to one and the same set of virtues, the distinctive virtues of dependent rational animals<ref>''Dependent Rational Animals'', 1, 5</ref>
</blockquote>

Engaging with scientific texts on human biology as well as works of [[philosophical anthropology]], MacIntyre identifies the human species as existing on a continuous scale of both intelligence and dependency with other animals such as dolphins. One of his main goals is to undermine what he sees as the fiction of the disembodied, independent reasoner who determines ethical and moral questions autonomously and what he calls the "illusion of self-sufficiency" that runs through much of Western ethics culminating in Nietzsche's ''[[Übermensch]]''.<ref>''Dependent Rational Animals'', 127</ref> In its place he tries to show that our embodied dependencies are a definitive characteristic of our species and reveal the need for certain kinds of virtuous dispositions if we are ever to flourish into independent reasoners capable of weighing the intellectual intricacies of moral philosophy in the first place.

==Virtue ethics==
MacIntyre is a key figure in the recent surge of interest in [[virtue ethics]], which identifies the central question of [[morality]] as having to do with the habits and knowledge concerning how to live a good life. His approach seeks to demonstrate that good [[judgment]] emanates from good [[Moral character|character]]. Being a good person is not about seeking to follow formal rules. In elaborating this approach, MacIntyre understands himself to be reworking the Aristotelian idea of an ethical [[teleology]].

MacIntyre emphasizes the importance of moral goods defined in respect to a community engaged in a 'practice'—which he calls 'internal goods' or 'goods of excellence'—rather than focusing on the practice-independent [[obligation]] of a moral agent ([[deontological ethics]]) or the [[Consequentialism|consequences]] of a particular act ([[utilitarianism]]). Before its recent resurgence, virtue ethics in European/American academia had been primarily associated with pre-modern philosophers (e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas). MacIntyre has argued that Aquinas' synthesis of Augustinianism with Aristotelianism is more insightful than modern moral theories by focusing upon the telos ('end', or completion) of social practice and of human life, within the context of which the morality of acts may be evaluated. His seminal work in the area of virtue ethics can be found in his 1981 book, ''[[After Virtue]]''.

MacIntyre intends the idea of [[virtue]] to supplement, rather than replace, moral rules. Indeed, he describes certain moral rules as 'exceptionless' or unconditional. MacIntyre considers his work to be outside "virtue ethics" due to his affirmation of virtues as embedded in specific, historically grounded, social practices.<ref>MacIntyre, [http://www.ucd.ie/news/2009/03FEB09/110309_macintyre.html “On having survived the academic moral philosophy of the twentieth century”], lecture of March 2009</ref>

==Politics==
:See also: [[New Monasticism]]
Politically, MacIntyre's ethics informs a defence of the Aristotelian 'goods of excellence' internal to practices against the modern pursuit of 'external goods', such as money, power, and status, that are characteristic of rule-based, [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]], [[Max Weber|Weberian]] modern institutions. He has been described as a 'revolutionary Aristotelian' because of his attempt to combine historical insights from his [[Marxism|Marxist]] past with those of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Aristotle]] after MacIntyre's conversion to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. For him, [[Classical liberalism|liberalism]] and [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] [[consumerism]] not only justify capitalism but also sustain and inform it over the long term. At the same time, he says that "Marxists have always fallen back into relatively straightforward versions of [[Kantianism]] or utilitarianism" (''After Virtue'', p.&nbsp;261) and criticises Marxism as just another form of radical [[individualism]]. He says about Marxists that "as they move towards power they always tend to become Weberians." Informed by that critique, [[Aristotelianism]] loses its sense of [[Elitism|elitist]] complacency; moral excellence ceases to be part of a particular, historical practice in [[ancient Greece]] and becomes a universal quality of those who understand that good judgment emanates from good character.

In 1951 in student debates at Manchester, MacIntyre described himself as a [[One-nation conservatism|Disraeli Tory]] but later was a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (leaving in 1956), briefly of the [[Socialist Labour League]], and later of the [[International Socialists (UK)|Socialist Review Group/International Socialists]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Sects & New left disillusionment | newspaper = The weekly worker | url = http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/813/sects-and-new-left-disillusionment/}}.</ref>

==Religion==
MacIntyre converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] in the early 1980s, and now does his work against the background of what he calls an "[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] [[Thomism|Thomist]] approach to moral philosophy."<ref name= "Solomon">{{cite web | last = Solomon | first = David |url= http://home.comcast.net/~icuweb/c04309.htm |title= Lecture 9: After Virtue |access-date= 2007-07-02 |url-status=dead | work = Twentieth-century ethics | publisher = International Catholic University |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100111063108/http://home.comcast.net/~icuweb/c04309.htm |archive-date= 11 January 2010 |df= dmy-all}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'', MacIntyre explains that his conversion to Catholicism occurred in his fifties as a "result of being convinced of Thomism while attempting to disabuse his students of its authenticity."<ref>{{Citation | title = Alastair MacIntyre | date = October 2010 | newspaper = Prospect | url = http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/10/alasdair-macintyre-on-money/ | access-date = 13 November 2010 | archive-date = 25 January 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110125084039/http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/10/alasdair-macintyre-on-money/ | url-status = dead }}.</ref> Also, in his book ''Whose Justice, Which Rationality?'' there is a section towards the end that is perhaps autobiographical when he explains how one is chosen by a tradition and may reflect his own conversion to Catholicism.<ref>''Whose Justice, Which Rationality?'' 1988, pp. 393–95.</ref>

Fuller accounts of MacIntyre's view of the relationship between philosophy and religion in general and Thomism and Catholicism in particular can be found in his essays "Philosophy recalled to its tasks" and "Truth as a good" (both found in the collection ''The Tasks of Philosophy'') as well as in the survey of the Catholic philosophical tradition he gives in ''God, Philosophy and Universities''.<ref>''The Tasks of Philosophy: Selected Essays, Vol. 1'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006); ''God, Philosophy and Universities'' (Plymouth, UK: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2009)</ref>
