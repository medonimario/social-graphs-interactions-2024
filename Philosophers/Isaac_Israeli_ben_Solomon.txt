'''Isaac Israeli ben Solomon''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: יצחק בן שלמה הישראלי, ''Yitzhak ben Shlomo ha-Yisraeli''; [[Arabic]]: أبو يعقوب إسحاق بن سليمان الإسرائيلي, ''Abu Ya'qub Ishaq ibn Suleiman al-Isra'ili'') ({{abbr|c.|circa}} 832 &ndash; {{abbr|c.|circa}} 932), also known as '''Isaac Israeli the Elder''' and '''Isaac Judaeus''', was one of the foremost [[Jewish]] physicians and philosophers living in the [[Arab world]] of his time. He is regarded as the father of medieval Jewish [[Neoplatonism]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Isaac ben Solomon Israeli|encyclopedia=Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isaac-ben-Solomon-Israeli}}</ref> His works, all written in [[Arabic]] and subsequently translated into [[Hebrew]], [[Latin]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], entered the medical curriculum of the early thirteenth-century universities in Medieval Europe and remained popular throughout the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>Jacquart and Micheau, "La Médecine Arabe et l'Occident Médiéval", Paris: Editions Maisonneuve et Larose, 1990, p.114</ref>

==Life==
Little is known of Israeli's background and career. Much that is known comes from the biographical accounts found in ''The Generations of the Physicians'', a work written by the Andalusian author [[Ibn Juljul]] in the 2nd half of the tenth century, and in ''[[Ṭabaqāt al-ʼUmam|Tabaqāt al-ʼUmam]] (Categories of Nations)'' by [[Said Al-Andalusi|Sa'id of Toledo]], who wrote in the mid-eleventh century.<ref>Stern, "Biographical note", pp. xxiii-xxiv</ref> In the thirteenth century, [[Ibn Abi Usaybi'a]] also produced an account, which he based on Ibn Juljul as well as other sources, including the ''History of the Fatimid Dynasty'' by Israel's pupil [[Ibn al-Jazzar]].<ref>Stern, "Biographical note", p. xxv.</ref>

Israeli was born in around 832 into a Jewish family in [[Egypt]]. He lived the first half of his life in [[Cairo]] where he gained a reputation as a skillful [[oculist]]. He corresponded with [[Saadya Gaon|Saadya ben Joseph al-Fayyumi]] (882-942), one of the most influential figures in the medieval Judaism, prior to his departure from Egypt. In about 904 Israeli was nominated court physician to the last [[Aghlabid]] prince, [[Ziyadat Allah III]]. Between the years 905-907 he travelled to [[Kairouan]] where he studied general medicine under [[Ishak ibn Amran al-Baghdadi]], with whom he is sometimes confounded ("Sefer ha-Yashar," p.&nbsp;10a). Later he served as a doctor to the founder of the [[Fatimid]] Dynasty of North Africa, [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah|'Ubaid Allah al-Mahdi]], who reigned from 910-934. The caliph enjoyed the company of his Jewish physician on account of the latter's wit and of the repartees in which he succeeded in confounding the [[Greek people|Greek]] al-Hubaish when pitted against him. In Kairouan his fame became widely extended, the works which he wrote in Arabic being considered by the [[Muslim]] physicians as "more valuable than gems." His lectures attracted a large number of pupils, of whom the two most prominent were [[Ibn Al-Jazzar|Abu Ja'far ibn al-Jazzar]], a Muslim, and [[Dunash ibn Tamim]]. Israeli studied [[natural history]], [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], and other scientific topics; he was reputed to be one who knew all the "seven sciences".

Biographers state that he never married or fathered children. He died at [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]], in 932. This date is given by most Arabic authorities who give his date of birth as 832. But [[Abraham ben Hasdai]], quoting the biographer [[Sanah ibn Sa'id al-Kurtubi]] ("Orient, Lit." iv., col. 230), says that Isaac Israeli died in 942. [[Heinrich Grätz]] (''Geschichte'' v. 236), while stating that Isaac Israeli lived more than one hundred years, gives the dates 845-940; and Steinschneider ("Hebr. Uebers." pp.&nbsp;388, 755) places his death in 950. He died in [[Kairouan]].

==Influence==
In 956 his pupil Dunash Ibn Tamim wrote an extensive commentary on [[Sefer Yetzirah]], a mystical work of cosmogony which attributes great importance to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and their combinations in determining the structure of the universe. In this work he cites Israeli so extensively that a few nineteenth-century scholars misidentified the commentary as Israeli's.

Israeli's medical treatises were studied for several centuries both in the original Arabic and in Latin translation. In the eleventh century, Constantine Africanus, a professor at the prestigious Salerno school of medicine, translated some of Israeli's works into Latin. Many medieval Arabic biographical chronicles of physicians list him and his works.

Israeli's philosophical works exercised a considerable influence on Christian and Jewish thinkers, and a lesser degree of influence among Muslim intellectuals. In the twelfth century, a group of scholars in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] transmitted many Arabic works of science and philosophy into Latin. One of the translators, [[Gerard of Cremona]], rendered Israeli's ''Book of Definitions'' (''Liber de Definicionibus/Definitionibus'') and ''Book on the Elements'' (''Liber Elementorum'') into Latin. Israeli's work was quoted and paraphrased by a number of Christian thinkers including [[Gundissalinus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Vincent de Beauvais]], [[Bonaventure|Bonaventura]], [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Nicholas of Cusa]]. Isaac Israeli's philosophical influence on Muslim authors is slight at best. The only known quotation of Israeli's philosophy in a Muslim work occurs in Ghayat al-Hakim, a book on magic, produced in eleventh-century Spain, translated into Latin and widely circulated in the West under the title Picatrix. Although there are passages which correspond directly to Israeli's writings, the author does not cite him by name.

His influence also extended to [[Moses Ibn Ezra]] (c. 1060-1139) who quotes Isaac Israeli without attribution in his treatise ''The Book of the Garden'', explaining the meaning of [[Metaphor]] and [[Literal Expression]]. The poet and philosopher [[Joseph Ibn Tzaddiq]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] (d. 1149) authored a work ''The Microcosm'' containing many ideas indebted to Israeli.

As Neoplatonist philosophy waned, in addition to the Galenic medical tradition of which Israeli was a part, the appreciable influence of Isaac Israeli diminished as well.

==Claimed works==
[[File:Isaac Judaeus; Omnia opera Ysaac... Wellcome L0027053.jpg|thumb|''Omnia opera Ysaac''. The cover shows an illustration of [['Ali ibn al-'Abbas al-Majusi]] (Haly Abbas), Isaac and [[Constantine the Jew]].]]

A number of works in Arabic, some of which were translated into Hebrew, Latin and Spanish were ascribed to Israeli, and several medical works were allegedly composed by him at the request of al-Mahdi. In 1515 ''Opera Omnia Isaci'' was published in [[Lyon]], [[France]], and the editor of this work claimed that the works originally written in Arabic and translated into [[Latin]] in 1087 by [[Constantine of Carthage]], who assumed their authorship, were a 'plagiarism' and published them under Israeli's name, together in a collection with works of other physicians that were also and erroneously attributed to Israeli. Those works translated by Constantine of Carthage were used as textbooks at the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|University of Salerno]], the earliest [[university]] in Western [[Europe]], where Constantine was a professor of medicine,  and remained in use as textbooks throughout Europe until the seventeenth century.

He was the first physician to write about [[tracheotomy]] in Arabic. He advised a hook to grasp the skin in the neck as [[Paulus of Aegina]] did and afterwards [[Avicenna]] and [[Albucasis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Missori|first=Paolo|author2=Brunetto, Giacoma M. |author3=Domenicucci, Maurizio |title=Origin of the Cannula for Tracheotomy During the Middle Ages and Renaissance|journal=World Journal of Surgery|date=7 February 2012|volume=36|issue=4|pages=928–934|doi=10.1007/s00268-012-1435-1|pmid=22311135|s2cid=3121262}}</ref>

===Medical works===
*''Kitab al-Ḥummayat'', ''The Book on Fevers'', in Hebrew ''Sefer ha-Ḳadaḥot, ספר הקדחות'', a complete treatise, in five books, on the kinds of [[fever]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ferre|first1=Lola|last2=Delgado|first2=José Martínez|date=2015-03-27|title=Arabic into Hebrew, A Case Study: Isaac Israeli's Book on Fevers|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/me/21/1/article-p50_3.xml|journal=Medieval Encounters|language=en|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|volume=21|issue=1|pages=50–80|doi=10.1163/15700674-12342183|issn=1570-0674}}</ref> according to the ancient physicians, especially [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]]. ''The Book on Fevers'' appeared in the [[Articella]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ferre|first1=Lola|last2=Veit|first2=Raphaela|date=2009|title=The Textual Traditions of Isaac Israeli's "Book on Fevers" in Arabic, Latin, Hebrew, and Spanish|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40385979|journal=Aleph|volume=9 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|issue=2|pages=309–334|doi=10.2979/ALE.2009.9.2.309 |jstor=40385979 |s2cid=170205381 |issn=1565-1525|via=[[JSTOR]]}}</ref>
*''Kitab al-Adwiyah al-Mufradah wa'l-Aghdhiyah'', a work in four sections on remedies and aliments. The first section, consisting of twenty chapters, was translated into Latin by Constantine under the title ''Diætæ Universales'', and into Hebrew by an anonymous translator under the title ''Ṭib'e ha-Mezonot''. The other three parts of the work are entitled in the Latin translation ''Diætæ Particulares''; and it seems that a Hebrew translation, entitled ''Sefer ha-Mis'adim'' or ''Sefer ha-Ma'akalim'', was made from the Latin.
*''Kitab al-Baul'', or in Hebrew ''Sefer ha-Shetan'', a treatise on urine, of which the author himself made an abridgement.
*''Kitab al-Istiḳat'', in Hebrew ''Sefer ha-Yesodot'' and Latin as ''De Elementis'', a medical and philosophical work on the elements, which the author treats according to the ideas of [[Aristotle]], Hippocrates, and [[Galen]]. The Hebrew translation was made by [[Abraham ben Hasdai]] at the request of the grammarian [[David Kimhi]].
*''Manhig ha-Rofe'im'', or ''Musar ha-Rofe'im'', a treatise, in fifty paragraphs, for physicians, translated into Hebrew (the Arabic original is not extant), and into German by David Kaufmann under the title ''Propädeutik für Aerzte'' (Berliner's "Magazin," xi. 97-112).
*''Kitab fi al-Tiryaḳ'', a work on antidotes. Some writers attribute to Isaac Israeli two other works which figure among Constantine's translations, namely, the ''Liber Pantegni'' and the ''Viaticum'', of which there are three Hebrew translations. But the former belongs to Mohammed al-Razi and the latter to 'Ali ibn 'Abbas or, according to other authorities, to Israeli's pupil Abu Jaf'ar ibn al-Jazzar.

===Philosophical works===
*''Kitab al-Ḥudud wal-Rusum'', translated into Hebrew by Nissim b. Solomon (fourteenth century) under the title ''Sefer ha-Gebulim weha-Reshumim'', a philosophical work of which a Latin translation is quoted in the beginning of the ''Opera Omnia''. This work and the ''Kitab al-Istiḳat'' were severely criticized by [[Maimonides]] in a letter to [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]] (''Iggerot ha-Rambam'', p.&nbsp;28, Leipsic, 1859), in which he declared that they had no value, inasmuch as Isaac Israeli ben Solomon was nothing more than a physician.
*''Kitab Bustan al-Ḥikimah'', on [[metaphysics]].
*''Kitab al-Ḥikmah'', a treatise on [[philosophy]].
*''Kitab al-Madkhal fi al-Mantiḳ'', on [[logic]]. The last three works are mentioned by Ibn Abi Uṣaibi'a, but no Hebrew translations of them are known.
*''Sefer ha-Ruaḥ weha-Nefesh'', a philosophical treatise, in a Hebrew translation, on the difference between the [[spirit (animating force)|spirit]] and the [[soul]], published by Steinschneider in ''[[Ha-Karmel]]'' (1871, pp.&nbsp;400–405). The editor is of opinion that this little work is a fragment of a larger one.
*A philosophical commentary on Genesis, in two books, one of which deals with Genesis i. 20.

===Attributed works===
[[Eliakim Carmoly]] ("Ẓiyyon," i. 46) concludes that the Isaac who was so violently attacked by [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] in the introduction to his commentary on the [[Pentateuch]], and whom he calls in other places "Isaac the Prattler", and "Ha-Yiẓḥaḳ," was none other than Isaac Israeli. But if Israeli was attacked by Ibn Ezra he was praised by other Biblical commentators, such as Jacob b. Ruben, a contemporary of Maimonides, and by Ḥasdai.

Another work which has been ascribed to Israeli, and which more than any other has given rise to controversy among later scholars, is a commentary on the "Sefer Yeẓirah." Steinschneider (in his "Al-Farabi," p.&nbsp;248) and Carmoly (in Jost's "Annalen," ii. 321) attribute the authorship to Israeli, because Abraham ibn Ḥasdai (see above), and Jedaiah Bedersi in his apologetical letter to Solomon ben Adret ("Orient, Lit." xi. cols. 166–169) speak of a commentary by Israeli on the "Sefer Yeẓirah," though by some scholars the words "Sefer Yeẓirah" are believed to denote simply the "Book of Genesis." But David Kaufmann ("R. E. J." viii. 126), Sachs ("Orient, Lit." l.c.), and especially Grätz (''Geschichte'' v. 237, note 2) are inclined to attribute its authorship to Israeli's pupil Dunash ibn Tamim.
