'''Claude Adrien Helvétius''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɛ|l|ˈ|v|iː|ʃ|ə|s}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/c+helvetius "Helvétius"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA|fr|klod adʁijɛ̃ ɛlvesjys|lang}}; 26 January 1715<ref>Ian Cumming, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HQ9S-xWkIBcC&dq= ''Helvetius: His Life and Place in the History of Educational Thought''], Routledge, 2013, p. 7.</ref> – 26 December 1771) was a French [[philosopher]], [[freemason]]<ref>Ian Cumming, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HQ9S-xWkIBcC&dq= ''Helvetius: His Life and Place in the History of Educational Thought''], Routledge, 2013, pp. 115–132.</ref> and ''[[littérateur]]''.

==Life==
Claude Adrien Helvétius was born in [[Paris, France]], and was descended from a family of physicians, originally surnamed ''Schweitzer'' (meaning "[[Switzerland|Swiss]]" in German; Latinized as ''[[Helvetia|Helvétius]]''). His great-grandfather [[Johann Friedrich Schweitzer]] known as "Helvetius", was a Dutch physician and alchemist, of German extraction. His grandfather [[Adriaan Helvetius]] introduced the use of [[Carapichea ipecacuanha|ipecacuanha]];<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FZk5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA509 Helvetius, Adriaan] in Biographisch woordenboek der Nederlanden, vol 8, (1867), p. 509.</ref> his father [[Jean Claude Adrien Helvétius]] was first physician to [[Marie Leszczynska|Marie Leszczyńska]], queen of France. Claude Adrien was trained for a financial career, apprenticed to his maternal uncle in Caen,<ref name="autogenerated1965">''Helvetius: A Study in Persecution'' by David Warner Smith, Clarendon Press Oxford, 1965.</ref> but he occupied his spare time with poetry. Aged twenty-three, at the queen's request, he was appointed as a [[wikt:farmer-general|farmer-general]], a tax-collecting post worth 100,000 crowns a year. Thus provided for, he proceeded to enjoy life to the utmost, with the help of his wealth and liberality, his literary and artistic tastes - he attended, for example, the progressive [[Club de l'Entresol]]. As he grew older, he began to seek more lasting distinctions, stimulated by the success of [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] as a [[mathematician]], of [[Voltaire]] as a [[poet]], and of [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] as a philosopher.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=254}} His wife, [[Anne-Catherine de Ligniville, Madame Helvétius]], maintained a salon attended by the leading figures of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] for over five decades.

In 1758 Helvétius published his philosophical [[magnum opus]], a work called ''De l'esprit'' (On Mind), which claimed that all human faculties are attributes of mere physical [[sensualism|sensation]], and that the only real motive is self-interest, therefore there is no good and evil, only competitive pleasures.  Its [[atheistic]], [[utilitarian]] and [[egalitarian]] doctrines raised a public outcry, and the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] publicly burned it in 1759, forcing Helvétius to issue several retractions.

In 1764 Helvétius visited England, and the next year, at the invitation of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], went to [[Berlin]], where the king paid him much attention.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=254}}

After 10 years, when he thought his fortune sufficient, he gave up the post of farmer-general, and retired to a country estate in France, where he employed his fortune in the relief of the poor, the encouragement of agriculture and the development of industries.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=254}} For this he won the admiration of many of the philosophers.

[[File:Friedrich Zweite Alt.jpg|thumb|Helvétius was one of several French ''[[philosophes]]'' who spent time at the court of [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia (depicted above)]]

Helvétius' family lived alternately on ''Château de Voré'' (Collines des Perches, [[Loir-et-Cher]]) and their Parisian townhouse at the ''rue Sainte-Anne''.

Religiously, Helvétius was a [[Deism|Deist]], albeit a "most indifferent" one.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Duzer |first=Charles Hunter Van |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V2kIAQAAIAAJ |title=Contribution of the Ideologues to French Revolutionary Thought |date=1935 |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |isbn=978-0-598-51150-8 |pages=55 |quote= Helvetius himself was a Deist – a most indifferent Deist|language=en}}</ref>

He died in Paris on December 26, 1771.

A work found in his papers called ''De l'homme, de ses facultés intellectuelles et de son éducation'' (On Man), was published in 1773.

==Philosophy==

===''De l'esprit'' and its reception===
Helvétius' philosophical studies ended in the production of his famous book ''De l'esprit'' (On Mind). It was first published in 1758 and was intended to be the rival of [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', with Helvétius arguing strongly against Montesquieu's theory that climate influenced the character of nations.

The work attracted immediate attention and aroused the most formidable opposition, especially from the dauphin [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)|Louis]], son of King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. The Advocate General [[Joseph Omer Joly de Fleury|Joly de Fleury]] condemned it in the [[Parlement#The Parlement of Paris|Parlement of Paris]] in January 1759. The [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] condemned the book, while the priests persuaded the court that it was full of the most dangerous doctrines. The book was declared to be heretical{{spaced ndash}}so atheistic that it was condemned by Church and State and was burned. Helvétius, terrified at the storm he had raised, wrote three separate and humiliating retractions. In spite of his protestations of orthodoxy, the book was publicly burned by the Paris hangman.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

It had far-reaching negative effects on the rest of the ''philosophes'', in particular, [[Denis Diderot]], and the work he was doing on the ''Encyclopédie''. The religious authorities, particularly the [[Jesuits]] and the new Pope, began to fear the spread of atheism and wanted to clamp down on the 'modern thought' hard and quickly. ''De l'esprit'' became almost a scapegoat for this.<ref name="autogenerated1965"/>
[[File:DeLespritFrontPage.png|thumb|Cover page of a 1759 English translation of ''De l'Esprit'']]

This great publicity resulted in the book being translated into almost all the languages of Europe. Voltaire said that it lacked originality. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] declared that the very benevolence of the author gave the lie to his principles. [[Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm|Grimm]] thought that all the ideas in the book were borrowed from [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]. [[Marie Anne de Vichy-Chamrond, marquise du Deffand|Madame du Deffand]] felt that Helvétius had raised such a storm by saying openly what everyone thought in secret. [[Françoise d'Issembourg d'Happoncourt, Madame de Graffigny|Madame de Graffigny]] claimed that all the good things in the book had been picked up in her own salon.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=254}}

===Psychological egoism===
{{Further|Psychological egoism}}

Helvétius' philosophy belongs to the Egoist school:

#All man's faculties may be reduced to physical [[sensualism|sensation]], even memory, comparison, judgment.  Our only difference from the lower animals lies in our external organization.
#Self-interest, founded on the love of pleasure and the fear of pain, is the sole spring of judgment, action, and affection.  Human beings are motivated solely by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain.  "These two," he says, "are, and always will be, the only principles of action in man."<ref>Helvétius, Claude Adrien, ''Treatise on Man: His Intellectual Faculties and his Education'', transl. W. Hooper, M. D., (London: Albion Press, 1810), p. 146</ref> Self-sacrifice is prompted by the fact that the sensation of pleasure outweighs the accompanying pain and is thus the result of deliberate calculation.
#We have [[determinism|no freedom of choice]] between good and evil.  There is no such thing as absolute right{{spaced ndash}}ideas of justice and injustice change according to customs.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=254}}

This view of man was largely [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]]{{spaced ndash}}man is a system deterministically controllable by a suitable combination of reward and punishment, and the ends of government are to ensure the maximization of pleasure.

===Natural equality of intelligences===
{{Further|Tabula rasa}}

"All men," Helvétius maintained, "have an equal disposition for understanding."<ref>Helvétius, Claude Adrien, ''De l'esprit or, Essays on the Mind, and Its Several Faculties'', (London: 1759), p. 286</ref> As one of the French Enlightenment's many [[John Locke|Lockean]] disciples, he regarded the human mind as a blank slate, but free not only from innate ideas but also from innate natural dispositions and propensities. Physiological constitution was at most a peripheral factor in men's characters or capabilities. Any apparent inequalities were independent of natural organization, and had their cause in the unequal desire for instruction. This desire springs from passions, of which all men commonly well organized are susceptible to the same degree. We thus owe everything to education. [[Social engineering (political science)|Social engineering]] is therefore an enterprise unconstrained by the natural abilities of men.

This natural equality applied to all men in all nations, and thus the differences in national characteristics were not the result of innate differences between the people therein, but rather a byproduct of the system of education and government. "No nation," wrote Helvétius, "has reason to regard itself superior to others by virtue of its innate endowment."<ref>Helvétius, ''De l'esprit'', p. 21</ref>

This radically egalitarian aspect of Helvétius' philosophy caused [[Diderot]] to remark that if it were true, ''De l'esprit'' might just as well have been written by Helvétius' dog keeper.{{cn|date=September 2023}}

===Omnipotence of education===
{{Further|Nature versus nurture}}

Since all men have the same natural potential, Helvétius argued, they all have the same ability to learn.  Thus, education is the method by which to reform society, and there are few limits to the drastic social improvements that could be brought about by the appropriate distribution of education.  Although people seem to possess certain qualities in greater abundance than their neighbours, the explanation for this comes 'from above' – it is caused by education, law and government. "If we commonly meet in London, with knowing men, who are with much more difficulty found in France," this is because it is a country where "every citizen has a share in the management of affairs in general."<ref>Helvétius, ''De l'esprit'', p. 100.</ref> "The art of forming men," he concludes, "is in all countries [...] strictly connected to the form of the government", and thus education via governmental intervention is the method of reform.<ref>Helvétius, ''De l'esprit'', p. 325</ref>

The crux of his thought was that public [[ethics]] has a utilitarian basis, and he insisted strongly on the importance of culture and education in national development.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=254–255}} His thinking can be described as unsystematic.{{by whom|date=March 2022}}

===Influence===
The original ideas in his system are those of the ''natural equality of intelligences'' and the ''omnipotence of education'', neither of which gained general acceptance, though both were prominent in the system of [[John Stuart Mill]].  [[Cesare, marchese de Beccaria-Bonesana|Cesare Beccaria]] states that he was largely inspired by Helvétius in his attempt to modify penal laws.  Helvétius also exerted some influence on the utilitarian [[Jeremy Bentham]].

The materialistic aspects of Helvétius, along with [[Baron d'Holbach]], had an influence on [[Karl Marx]], the theorist of [[historical materialism]] and [[communism]], who studied the ideas of Helvétius in [[Paris]] and later called the materialism of Helvétius and d'Holbach "the social basis of communism".<ref>Mehring, Franz, ''Karl Marx: The Story of His Life'' (Routledge, 2003) pg. 75</ref>

===Criticism===
German philosopher [[Johann Georg Hamann]] vigorously opposed Helvétius's rationalistic doctrines.<ref>Robert Alan Sparling, ''Johann Georg Hamann and the Enlightenment Project'', University of Toronto Press, 2011, p. 34.</ref>

British philosopher [[Isaiah Berlin]] listed Helvétius, along with [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Joseph de Maistre|Maistre]] as one of the six "enemies of freedom" who constituted the ideological basis for modern [[authoritarianism]], in his book ''Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty''.<ref>Berlin, Isaiah, ''Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty'' (Princeton University Press, 2003)</ref>

==Poetry==
His poetic ambitions resulted in the poem called ''Le Bonheur'' (published posthumously, with an account of Helvétius's life and works, by [[Jean François de Saint-Lambert]], 1773), in which he develops the idea that true happiness is only to be found in making the interest of one person that of all.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=254}}

==Bibliography==
A work called ''De l'homme, de ses facultés intellectuelles et de son éducation'', found among his manuscripts, was published after his death. There is a complete edition of the works of Helvétius, published at Paris, 1818.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=255 }}
