'''Karl Johann Kautsky''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aʊ|t|s|k|i}}; {{IPA|de|ˈkaʊtski|lang}}; 16 October 1854 – 17 October 1938) was a Czech-Austrian [[philosopher]], journalist, and [[Marxism|Marxist]] theorist. A leading theorist of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Second International]], Kautsky advocated [[orthodox Marxism]], which emphasized the [[Scientific socialism|scientific]], [[Historical materialism|materialist]], and [[Economic determinism|determinist]] character of [[Karl Marx]]'s work. This interpretation dominated European Marxism for two decades, from the death of [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1895 to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914.

Born in [[Prague]], Kautsky studied at the [[University of Vienna]]. In 1875, he joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]], and from 1883 founded and edited the influential socialist journal ''[[Die Neue Zeit]]''. From 1885 to 1890, he lived in London, where he worked with Engels. In Germany, he became active in the SPD and wrote the theory section of the party's [[Erfurt Program]] (1891), which became a major influence on other European socialist parties. He briefly left in 1917 to join the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD) because of his opposition to the increasing collaboration of the SPD with the war effort, but rejoined in 1922. By the 1930s, his influence and involvement in politics was dwindling, and he died in [[Amsterdam]] in 1938.

Kautsky's interpretation of Marxism held that history could not be "hurried", and that politically workers and workers' parties must wait for the material economic conditions for a socialist revolution to be met. Under his influence, the SPD adopted a gradualist approach, taking advantage of bourgeois [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] to improve the lives of workers until capitalism was brought down by its internal contradictions. His positions led to disputes with other leading Marxists, including [[Eduard Bernstein]], who favored a [[Reformism|reformist]] approach; [[Rosa Luxemburg]], who advocated [[revolutionary spontaneity]]; and [[Vladimir Lenin]], who Kautsky believed had initiated a premature [[October Revolution|socialist revolution in Russia in 1917]] and led the [[Soviet Union]] toward a dictatorship.

== Life and career ==

===Early years===
Karl Kautsky was born in [[Prague]] of an artistic and middle class family – his parents were [[Johann Kautsky]], a Czech scenic designer, and [[Minna Kautsky|Wilhelmine “Minna” Kautsky]] (née Jaich), an Austrian actress and writer of Czech descent. The family moved to [[Vienna]] when Kautsky was the age of seven. He studied [[history]], [[philosophy]] and [[economics]] at the [[University of Vienna]] from 1874, and became a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ) in 1875. Shortly afterwards he published his first contributions in the German socialist journals ''[[Der Volksstaat]]'' and ''[[Vorwärts]]'' and to the Austrian journals ''Gleichheit'' and ''Der Sozialist.''<ref name ="firstpub">{{harvnb|Steenson|1991|pp=30–31}}; {{harvnb|Blumenberg|1960|pp=19–20}}</ref>

In 1880 he joined a group of German socialists in [[Zurich]] who were supported financially by [[Karl Höchberg]], and who smuggled socialist material into Germany at the time of the [[Anti-Socialist Laws]] (1878&ndash;1890).

===Political career===
In 1883, Kautsky founded the monthly ''[[Die Neue Zeit]]'' ("The New Times") in [[Stuttgart]]. It became a weekly in 1890. He edited the magazine until September 1917: this gave him a steady income and allowed him to propagate [[Marxism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.goucher.edu/history231/steenson.htm |author=Gary P Steenson |title= "Not One Man! Not One Penny!" German Social Democracy, 1863-1914 |access-date=2007-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518004612/http://faculty.goucher.edu/history231/steenson.htm |archive-date=18 May 2008 }}</ref>
From 1885 to 1890 he spent time in [[London]], where he became a close friend of Friedrich Engels. His position as a prominent Marxist theorist was assured in 1888, when Engels put him to the task of editing Marx's three-volume work ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blackledge|first=Paul|title=Karl Kautsky and Marxist Historiography|journal=Science & Society|date=July 2006|volume=70|issue=3|pages=338|doi=10.1521/siso.70.3.337|jstor=40404839}}</ref> In 1891 he co-authored the [[Erfurt Program]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) together with [[August Bebel]] and [[Eduard Bernstein]].

Following the death of Engels in 1895, Kautsky became one of the most important and influential theoreticians of Marxism, representing the mainstream of the party together with [[August Bebel]], and outlining a Marxist theory of [[imperialism]]. When Bernstein attacked the traditional Marxist position of the necessity for revolution in the late 1890s, Kautsky denounced him, arguing that Bernstein's emphasis on the ethical foundations of Socialism opened the road to a call for an alliance with the "progressive" bourgeoisie and a non-class approach.

===Wartime years===
In 1914, when the German Social-Democrat deputies in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] voted for war credits, Kautsky (who was not a deputy but attended their meetings) suggested abstaining. Kautsky claimed that Germany was waging a defensive war against the threat of Czarist Russia. However, in June 1915, about ten months after the war had begun and when it had become obvious that this was going to be a sustained, appallingly brutal and costly struggle, he issued an appeal with Eduard Bernstein and [[Hugo Haase]] against the pro-war leaders of the SPD and denounced the German government's annexationist aims. In 1917 he left the SPD for the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD) with united socialists who opposed the war.

After the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|November Revolution]] in Germany, Kautsky served as under-secretary of State in the Foreign Office in the short-lived SPD-USPD revolutionary government and worked at finding documents which disproved the alleged war guilt of Imperial Germany.

===Post-war years===
[[File:E. Klar. Kautsky in Georgia 1920.jpg|thumb|left|Kautsky with the Georgian Social-Democrats, Tbilisi, 1920]]
[[File:18-kautsky-diediktatur desproletariats.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kautsky's opening broadside against the revolutionary violence of the Russian Revolution, ''Die Diktatur des Proletariats'' (The Dictatorship of the Proletariat), first published in Vienna in 1918.]]
In 1920, when the USPD split, he went with a minority of that party back into the SPD. He visited [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in 1920 and wrote a book on the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] that at that moment was still independent of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]]. By the time it was published in 1921, Georgia had been thoroughly influenced by the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Red Army had invaded Georgia]], and the Bolsheviks had [[Soviet Occupation Day (Georgia)|imposed]] the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. By that point, Kautsky considered the Soviet Union to have become an imperialist state, due to the destructiveness of the invasion of Georgia, and the minimal political role that the actual proletariat had in Soviet Russia.<ref>{{cite book | first = Karl | last = Kautsky | year = 1921 | title = Georgia | chapter = XIII The Moscow Bonapartism | chapter-url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1921/georgia/ch09.htm | access-date = 2021-06-10 | via = Marxists Internet Archive | archive-date = 2021-06-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210610025431/https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1921/georgia/ch09.htm | url-status = live }}</ref>

Kautsky assisted in the creation of the party program adopted in Heidelberg (1925) by the German Social Democratic Party. In 1924, at the age of 70, he moved back to Vienna with his family, and remained there until 1938. At the time of Hitler's [[Anschluss]], he fled to [[Czechoslovakia]] and thence by plane to [[Amsterdam]], where he died in the same year.

Karl Kautsky lived in [[Berlin]]-[[Friedenau]] for many years; his wife, [[Luise Kautsky]], became a close friend of [[Rosa Luxemburg]], who also lived in Friedenau. A commemorative plaque marks where Kautsky lived at Saarstraße 14.

[[Vladimir Lenin]] described Kautsky as a "renegade" in his pamphlet ''[[The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky]]''; Kautsky in turn castigated Lenin in his 1934 work ''Marxism and Bolshevism: Democracy and Dictatorship'':
{{Blockquote |The Bolsheviki under Lenin's leadership, however, succeeded in capturing control of the armed forces in Petrograd and later in Moscow and thus laid the foundation for a new dictatorship in place of the old Czarist dictatorship.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1934/bolshevism/ | first = Karl | last = Kautsky | title = Marxism and Bolshevism | year = 1934 | website = Marxists | access-date = 2020-04-15 | archive-date = 2021-08-13 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210813073534/https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1934/bolshevism/ | url-status = live }}</ref>}}

A collection of excerpts of Kautsky's writings, ''Social Democracy vs. Communism,'' discussed Bolshevist rule in Russia. He saw the Bolsheviks (or Communists) as a conspiratorial organization that had gained power by a coup and initiated revolutionary changes for which there was no economic rationale in Russia. Instead, a bureaucracy-dominated society developed, the miseries of which outweighed the problems of Western [[capitalism]], he argued. He stated:
{{Blockquote |Foreign tourists in Russia stand in silent amazement before the gigantic enterprises created there, as they stand before the pyramids, for example. Only seldom does the thought occur to them what enslavement, what lowering of human self-esteem was connected with the construction of those gigantic establishments. ... They extracted the means for the creation of material productive forces by destroying the most essential productive force of all – the laboring man. In the terrible conditions created by the [[Five-year plans of the Soviet Union|Piatiletka]], people rapidly perished. Soviet films, of course, did not show this.<ref name="SDvC">{{cite book |last= Kautsky |first= Karl |title= Social Democracy vs. Communism |url= https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1930s/demvscom/ |chapter= Is Soviet Russia A Socialist State? |access-date= 2015-11-07 |archive-date= 2014-04-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140426044254/http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1930s/demvscom/ |url-status= live }}</ref>}}

===Death and legacy===

Kautsky died on 17 October 1938, in Amsterdam. His son, {{ill|Benedikt Kautsky|de|Benedikt Kautsky}}, spent seven years in [[concentration camp]]s; his wife, [[Luise Kautsky]], was murdered in [[Auschwitz]].<ref>Callinicos, A. ''Social Theory: a historical introduction''.</ref>

Kautsky is notable for, in addition to his anti-[[Bolshevik]] polemics, his editing and publication of Marx's ''[[Capital, Volume IV]]'' (usually published as ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'').
