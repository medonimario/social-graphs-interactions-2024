'''Scott Soames''' ({{IPAc-en|s|oʊ|m|z}}; born 1945) is an American philosopher. He is a professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Southern California]] (since 2004), and before that at [[Princeton University]]. He specializes in the [[philosophy of language]] and the history of [[analytic philosophy]]. He is well known for defending and expanding on the program in the philosophy of language started by [[Saul Kripke]] as well as being a major critic of [[Two dimensionalism|two-dimensionalist]] theories of meaning.

==Life and career==
Scott Soames was born in 1945. He did his undergraduate work in philosophy at [[Stanford University]] and his graduate work at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in [[linguistics]] and philosophy. He received his Ph.D. in philosophy from MIT in 1976.<ref name="usc">From Soames's [https://web.archive.org/web/20051228135502/http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~soames/ web page at USC].</ref>

Soames taught briefly at [[Yale University]] (from 1976 to 1980) and, then, from 1980 to 2004 at [[Princeton University]].<ref name="usc"/> His departure from Princeton in 2004 was seen as a major loss at the philosophy department there. [[Gilbert Harman]], one of Soames's colleagues, was quoted at the time saying that "He's one of the most distinguished people we've got."<ref>The ''Daily Princeton'', [http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2004/03/08/news/9870.shtml "Soames leaves for USC, weakening philosophy dept."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020030203/http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2004/03/08/news/9870.shtml |date=2006-10-20 }}, March 8, 2004.</ref> Since 2004, he has been a professor at the [[University of Southern California]], Department of Philosophy. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2010.<ref>[https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/716/braudy-soames-elected-to-american-academy-of-arts-and-sciences/ dornsife.usc.edu]</ref>

Soames is a public advocate and supporter of [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buskirk |first1=Chris |title=Scholars & Writers for Trump |url=https://amgreatness.com/2016/09/28/writes-scholars-for-trump/ |website=American Greatness |access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref>

==Philosophical work==
Soames specializes in the [[philosophy of language]] and the history of [[analytic philosophy]]. He has published books and articles primarily on issues concerning [[truth]], [[reference]], and meaning. Fairly early in his career, he and [[Nathan Salmon]] edited a book entitled ''Propositions and Attitudes'' (1989), a collection of readings that investigates philosophical issues surrounding the nature of propositions. Later in his career, Soames has been known for expanding on the anti-descriptivist philosophy of language developed by [[Saul Kripke]] in ''Naming and Necessity'' (1972/1980)—see Soames's ''Beyond Rigidity: The Unfinished Semantic Agenda of 'Naming and Necessity''' (2002). He is also a major critic of [[Two dimensionalism|two-dimensionalist]] theories of [[semantics]]—see his ''Reference and Description: The Case against Two-Dimensionalism'' (2005).

''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century'' (2003), his two-volume history of analytic philosophy developed from a lecture course regularly given at Princeton, has been the subject of significant controversy among historians of analytic philosophy, with exchanges, often heated, on the ''Notre Dame Philosophical Review'', [[Brian Weatherson]]'s [[blog]], the journal ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', and Soames's own web page.<ref>See, e.g., Soames's [https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220904/http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~soames/replies/Rep_APA.pdf "Reply to Critics of ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century'': Christopher Pincock, Thomas Hurka, Michael Kremer, and Paul Horwich"]; https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/678/docs/Replies/Rep__Philosophical_Ayalysis.pdf</ref>
