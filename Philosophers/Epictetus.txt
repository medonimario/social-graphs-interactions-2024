Epictetus studied [[stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] under [[Musonius Rufus]], and after his manumission began to teach philosophy. After his banishment to Nicopolis, he founded a school there. Epictetus taught that philosophy is [[Modus vivendi|a way of life]] and not simply a theoretical discipline. To Epictetus, all external events are [[determinism|beyond our control]]; he argues that we should accept whatever happens calmly and dispassionately. However, individuals are [[Moral responsibility|responsible for their own actions]], which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline. His teachings were written down and published by his pupil [[Arrian]] in his ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'' and ''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus|Enchiridion]]''.

== Life ==
Epictetus was born around AD 50,<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=epictetus |title=Epictetus |last=Graver |first=Margaret}}</ref><ref>The year of his birth is uncertain. He was born a slave. We do know that he was born early enough to be teaching philosophy by around AD 93, when Domitian banished all philosophers from [[Rome]], because he was among those who left the city. He also described himself as an old man to Arrian around 108 AD cf. [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses''], i.9.10; i.16.20; ii.6.23; etc.</ref> presumably at [[Hierapolis]], [[Phrygia]].<ref>Suda. ''Epictetus''.</ref> The name his parents gave him is unknown. The word ''epíktētos'' (ἐπίκτητος) in [[Greek language|Greek]] simply means "gained" or "acquired";<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=%E1%BC%90%CF%80%CE%AF%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82&la=greek#Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=e)pi/kthtos-contents|title=Greek Word Study Tool|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> the Greek philosopher [[Plato]], in his ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', used the term to mean property that is "added to one's hereditary property."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0059,034:924a&lang=original|title=Plato, Laws, section 924a|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> He spent his youth in Rome as a [[slavery|slave]] to [[Epaphroditus (freedman of Nero)|Epaphroditus]], a wealthy [[freedman]] and secretary to [[Nero]].<ref>[https://www.livius.org/ei-er/epaphroditus/epaphroditus.html Epaphroditus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802005238/http://www.livius.org/ei-er/epaphroditus/epaphroditus.html |date=2014-08-02 }}, livius.org</ref> His social position was thus complicated, combining the low status of a slave with the high status of one with a personal connection to Imperial power.<ref>P. Christoforou, ''Imagining the Roman Emperor'' (2023), p. 22</ref>

Early in life, Epictetus acquired a passion for philosophy and, with the permission of his wealthy master, he studied [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy under [[Musonius Rufus]].<ref>Epictetus, [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses'']. i.7.32.</ref> Becoming more educated in this way raised his social status.<ref>Epictetus, [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses''], i.9.29.</ref> At some point, he became disabled.

[[File:Nicopolis nymphaeum.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Roman-era ruins (the [[Nymphaeum]]) at [[Nicopolis]]]]
Epictetus obtained his freedom sometime after the death of Nero in AD 68,<ref>Douglas J. Soccio, ''Archetypes of Wisdom: An Introduction to Philosophy'' (2012), p. 197</ref> and he began to teach [[philosophy]] in Rome. Around AD 93, when the [[Roman emperor]] [[Domitian]] banished all philosophers from the city,<ref>Suetonius, [http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/suet-domitian-rolfe.html ''Domitian''], x.</ref> Epictetus moved to [[Nicopolis]] in [[Epirus]], [[Greece]], where he founded a school of philosophy.<ref>Aulus Gellius, ''Attic Nights'', xv. 11.</ref>

His most famous pupil, [[Arrian]], studied under him as a young man (around AD 108) and claimed to have written his famous ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'' based on the notes he took on Epictetus's lectures. Arrian argued that his Discourses should be considered comparable to the [[Socrates|Socratic]] literature.<ref>Hendrik Selle: ''Dichtung oder Wahrheit&nbsp;– Der Autor der Epiktetischen Predigten''. Philologus 145 [2001] 269–290</ref> Arrian described Epictetus as a powerful speaker who could "induce his listener to feel just what Epictetus wanted him to feel."<ref name="arrian1">Epictetus, [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses''], prologue.</ref> Many eminent figures sought conversations with him.<ref>Epictetus, [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses''], i.11; ii.14; iii.4; iii. 7; etc.</ref> Emperor [[Hadrian]] was friendly with him<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/aelius-hadrian.html Historia Augusta, ''Hadrian''], 16.</ref> and may have heard him speak at his school in Nicopolis.<ref>Fox, Robin ''The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian'' Basic Books. 2006 p. 578</ref><ref>A surviving second- or third-century work, ''Altercatio Hadriani Et Epicteti'' gives a fictitious account of a conversation between Hadrian and Epictetus.</ref>

Epictetus lived a life of great [[simple living|simplicity]], with few possessions.<ref name="simpl1"/> He lived alone for a long time,<ref>Simplicius, ''Commentary on the Enchiridion'', 46. There is a joke at Epictetus' expense in Lucian's [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6829 ''Life of Demonax''] about the fact that he had no family.</ref> but in his old age, he adopted a friend's child who otherwise would have been left to die, and raised him with the aid of a woman.<ref>Simplicius, ''Commentary on the Enchiridion'', 46. It is possible that he married her, but Simplicius' language on that subject is ambiguous.</ref> It is unclear whether Epictetus and she were married.<ref>Lucian, Demoxan, c. 55, torn, ii., ed Hemsterh., p. 393; as quoted in ''A Selection from the Discourses of Epictetus With the Encheiridion'' (2009), p. 6</ref> He died sometime around AD 135.<ref>He apparently was alive in the reign of [[Hadrian]] (117–138). [[Marcus Aurelius]] (born AD 121) was an admirer, but never met him, and [[Aulus Gellius]] ([https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/2*.html#18.10 ii.18.10]) writing mid-century, speaks of him as if he belonged to the recent past.</ref> After his death, according to [[Lucian]], his [[oil lamp]] was purchased by an admirer for 3,000 [[Ancient drachma|drachma]]e.<ref>Lucian, [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6829 ''Remarks to an illiterate book-lover''].</ref>

== Thought ==
[[Image:Epictetus.png|thumb|upright|An eighteenth century engraving of Epictetus]]

No writings by Epictetus are known. His discourses were transcribed and compiled by his pupil [[Arrian]] ({{circa|86/89|after 146/160 AD}}).<ref name="arrian1"/> The main work is ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|The Discourses]]'', four books of which have been preserved (out of the original eight).<ref>[[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], ''Bibliotheca,'' states that there were eight books.</ref> Arrian also compiled a popular digest, entitled the ''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus|Enchiridion]]'', or ''Handbook.'' In a preface to the ''Discourses'' that is addressed to Lucius Gellius, Arrian states that "whatever I heard him say I used to write down, word for word, as best I could, endeavouring to preserve it as a memorial, for my own future use, of his way of thinking and the frankness of his speech."<ref name="arrian1"/> In the sixth century, the [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] wrote an extant commentary on the ''Enchiridion''.<ref>George Long, (1890), ''The Discourses of Epictetus, with the Encheridion and Fragments'', p. 390. George Bell and Sons</ref>

Epictetus maintains that the foundation of all philosophy is [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]]; that is, the conviction of our ignorance and gullibility ought to be the first subject of our study.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii.11.1</ref> [[Logic]] provides valid reasoning and certainty in judgment, but it is subordinate to practical needs.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i.7.1–8</ref> The first and most necessary part of philosophy concerns the application of doctrine, for example, that people should not [[lie]]. The second concerns reasons, e.g., why people should not lie. The third, lastly, examines and establishes the reasons.<ref name="ritter201">[[Heinrich Ritter]], Alexander James William Morrison, (1846), ''The History of Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 4, p. 201</ref> This is the logical part, which finds reasons, shows what is a reason, and that a given reason is a correct one.<ref name="ritter201"/> This last part is necessary, but only on account of the second, which again is rendered necessary by the first.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', iii.2.1–6; ''Enchiridion'', 52</ref>

===''Prohairesis''===
Both the ''Discourses'' and the ''Enchiridion'' begin by distinguishing between those things in our power (''prohairetic'' things) and those things not in our power (''aprohairetic'' things).<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i.1; ''Enchiridion'', 1</ref>

<blockquote>That alone is in our power, which is our own work; and in this class are our opinions, impulses, desires, and aversions. On the contrary, what is not in our power, are our bodies, possessions, glory, and power. Any delusion on this point leads to the greatest errors, misfortunes, and troubles, and to the slavery of the soul.<ref name="ritter204">Heinrich Ritter, Alexander James William Morrison, (1846), ''The History of Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 4, p. 204</ref></blockquote>

{{Blockquote|We have no power over external things, and the good that ought to be the object of our earnest pursuit, is to be found only within ourselves.<ref name="ritter206">Heinrich Ritter, Alexander James William Morrison, (1846), ''The History of Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 4, p. 206</ref>}}

The determination between what is good and what is not good is made by the capacity for choice (''[[prohairesis]]'').<ref>Giovanni Reale, John R. Catan, 1990, ''A History of Ancient Philosophy: The schools of the Imperial Age'', p. 80. SUNY Press</ref> Prohairesis allows us to act, and gives us the kind of freedom that only rational animals have.<ref>Christopher Gill, 1995, ''The Discourses of Epictetus'', p. xx. Everyman</ref> It is determined by our reason, which of all our faculties, sees and tests itself and everything else.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i.1.4; i.20</ref> It is the correct use of the impressions (''[[Phantasiai|phantasia]]'') that bombard the mind that is in our power:<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii.19.32.</ref>

<blockquote>Practice then from the start to say to every harsh impression, "You are an impression, and not at all the thing you appear to be." Then examine it and test it by these rules you have, and firstly, and chiefly, by this: whether the impression has to do with the things that are up to us, or those that are not; and if it has to do with the things that are not up to us, be ready to reply, "It is nothing to me."<ref>Epictetus, ''Enchiridion'', 1</ref></blockquote>

We will not be troubled at any loss, but will say to ourselves on such an occasion: "I have lost nothing that belongs to me; it was not something of mine that was torn from me, but something that was not in my power has left me." Nothing beyond the use of our [[doxa|opinion]] is properly ours. Every possession rests on opinion. What is to cry and to weep? An opinion. What is misfortune, or a quarrel, or a complaint? All these things are opinions; opinions founded on the delusion that what is not subject to our own choice can be either good or evil, which it cannot.<ref name="ritter206"/> By rejecting these opinions, and seeking good and evil in the power of choice alone, we may confidently achieve peace of mind in every condition of life.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', iii.3.14–19; ''Enchiridion'', 6</ref>

===Good and evil===
Epictetus says that:

[[Reason]] alone is good, the irrational is evil, and the irrational is intolerable to the rational.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i.2.1</ref> The good person should labour chiefly on their own reason; to perfect this is in our power.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', iii.8; iii.15.1–13; ''Enchiridion'', 29</ref> To repel evil opinions by the good is the noble contest in which humans should engage; it is not an easy task, but it promises true freedom, peace of mind (''[[ataraxia]]''), and a divine command over the emotions (''[[apatheia]]'').<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii.18.19–31; iii.3.14–22</ref> We should especially be on our guard against the opinion of pleasure because of its apparent sweetness and charms.<ref>Epictetus, ''Enchiridion'', 34.</ref> The first object of philosophy, therefore, is to purify the mind.<ref name="ritter207">Heinrich Ritter, Alexander James William Morrison, (1846), ''The History of Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 4, p. 207</ref>

The preconceptions (''prolepsis'') of good and evil are common to all.<ref name="ritter208">Heinrich Ritter, Alexander James William Morrison, (1846), ''The History of Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 4, p. 208</ref> Good alone is profitable and to be desired, and evil is hurtful and to be avoided.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i.22.1; ii.11.3</ref> Different opinions arise only from the application of these preconceptions to particular cases, and it is then that the darkness of ignorance, which blindly maintains the correctness of its own opinion, must be dispelled.<ref name="ritter208"/> People entertain different and conflicting opinions of good, and in their judgment of a particular good, people frequently contradict themselves.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii.11.8–13; iii.14.11–14</ref> Philosophy should provide a standard for good and evil.<ref name="ritter209">Heinrich Ritter, Alexander James William Morrison, (1846), ''The History of Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 4, p. 209</ref> This process is greatly facilitated because the mind and the works of the mind are alone in our power, whereas all external things that aid life are beyond our control.<ref name="ritter209"/>

The essence of divinity is goodness; we have all good that could be given to us.<ref name="ritter217">Heinrich Ritter, Alexander James William Morrison, (1846), ''The History of Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 4, p. 217</ref> The deities too gave us the soul and reason, which is not measured by breadth or depth, but by knowledge and sentiments, and by which we attain to greatness, and may equal even with the deities. We should, therefore, cultivate the mind with special care.<ref name="ritter218">Heinrich Ritter, Alexander James William Morrison, (1846), ''The History of Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 4, p. 218</ref> If we wish for nothing, but what God wills, we shall be truly free, and all will come to pass with us according to our desire; and we shall be as little subject to restraint as [[Zeus]] himself.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii.17.22–33</ref>

Every individual is connected with the rest of the world, and the [[universe]] is fashioned for universal harmony.<ref name="ritter218"/> Wise people, therefore, will pursue, not merely their own will, but also will be subject to the rightful order of the world.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i.12.16–17</ref> We should conduct ourselves through life fulfilling all our duties as children, siblings, parents, and citizens.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', iii.2.4</ref>

For our country or friends we ought to be ready to undergo or perform the greatest difficulties.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', iii.20.4–14</ref> The good person, if able to foresee the future, would peacefully and contentedly help to bring about their own sickness, maiming, and even death, knowing that this is the correct order of the universe.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii.10.4–5</ref> We have all a certain part to play in the world, and we have done enough when we have performed what our nature allows.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i.2.33–37; ''Enchiridion'', 24, 37</ref> In the exercise of our powers, we may become aware of the [[destiny]] we are intended to fulfil.<ref name="ritter220">Heinrich Ritter, Alexander James William Morrison, (1846), ''The History of Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 4, p. 220</ref>

We are like travellers at an inn or guests at a stranger's table; whatever is offered we take with thankfulness, and sometimes, when the turn comes, we may refuse; in the former case we are a worthy guest of the deities, and in the latter we appear as a sharer in their power.<ref>Epictetus, ''Enchiridion'', 11, 15</ref> Anyone who finds life intolerable is free to quit it, but we should not abandon our appointed role without sufficient reason.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i.29.29; iii.24.97–101</ref> The Stoic sage will never find life intolerable and will complain of no one, neither deity nor human.<ref name="ritter210">Heinrich Ritter, Alexander James William Morrison, (1846), ''The History of Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 4, p. 210</ref> Those who go wrong we should pardon and treat with [[compassion]], since it is from ignorance that they err, being as it were, blind.<ref>Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i.18.6–8; i.28.9–10</ref>

It is only our opinions and principles that can render us unhappy, and it is only the ignorant person who finds fault with another.<ref name="ritter211">Heinrich Ritter, Alexander James William Morrison, (1846), ''The History of Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 4, p. 211</ref> Every [[Desire (philosophy)|desire]] degrades us, and renders us slaves of what we desire.<ref name="ritter211"/> We ought not to forget the transitory character of all external advantages, even in the midst of our enjoyment of them; but always to bear in mind that they are not our own, and that therefore, they do not properly belong to us. Thus prepared, we shall never be carried away by opinions.<ref name="ritter212">Heinrich Ritter, Alexander James William Morrison, (1846), ''The History of Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 4, p. 212</ref>

The final entry of the ''Enchiridion,'' or ''Handbook,'' begins: "Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand":

<blockquote><poem>Conduct me, Zeus, and thou, Destiny,
Wherever thy decree has fixed my lot.
I follow willingly; and, did I not,
Wicked and wretched would I follow still.
([[Diogenes Laërtius]] quoting [[Cleanthes]]; quoted also by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], Epistle 107.)"</poem></blockquote>

<blockquote><poem>Whoe'er yields properly to Fate is deemed
Wise among men, and knows the laws of Heaven.
(From [[Euripides]]' Fragments, 965)</poem></blockquote>

<blockquote><poem>Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be.
(From [[Plato]]'s ''[[Crito]]'')</poem></blockquote>

<blockquote><poem>Anytus and Meletus may indeed kill me, but they cannot harm me.
(From Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'')</poem></blockquote>

=== Philosophy ===
==== Marcus Aurelius ====
The philosophy of Epictetus influenced the Roman emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (AD 121 to AD 180), who cites Epictetus in his ''[[Meditations]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Marcus Aurelius, Emperor and Philosopher |first=G. R. |last=Stanton |journal=[[Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte]] |year=1969 |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=570–587 |jstor=4435105}}</ref>

==== French philosophers ====
[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers [[Voltaire]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Baron d'Holbach]] all read the [[Enchiridion of Epictetus|''Enchiridion'']] when they were students.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atheism in France, 1650–1729, Volume 1: The Orthodox Sources of Disbelief|last=Kors|first=Alan Charles|date=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691055750|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=188}}</ref> [[Blaise Pascal]] listed Epictetus as among those philosophers he was most familiar with, describing him as a "great mind" who is "among the philosophers of the world who have best understood the duties of man".<ref>{{cite book |title=Blaise Pascal Thoughts, Letters, and Minor Works |date=2007 |publisher=Cosimo |page=393}}</ref>

=== Literature ===
The philosophy of Epictetus plays a key role in the 1998 novel ''[[A Man in Full]]'' by [[Tom Wolfe]]. This was in part the outcome of discussions Wolfe had with [[James Stockdale]] (see below). The character Conrad, who through a series of mishaps finds himself in jail and accidentally acquires a copy of the ''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus]]'', the Stoic's manual, discovers a philosophy that strengthens him to endure the brutality of the prison environment. He experiences [[Joseph Campbell]]'s '[[hero's journey]]' call to action and becomes a strong, honorable, undefeatable protagonist. The importance of Epictetus' Stoicism for Stockdale, its role in ''A Man in Full'', and its significance in [[Ridley Scott]]'s film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' are discussed by William O. Stephens in ''The Rebirth of Stoicism?''.<ref>[http://puffin.creighton.edu/phil/Stephens/rebirth_of_stoicism.htm The Rebirth of Stoicism<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231164830/http://puffin.creighton.edu/phil/Stephens/rebirth_of_stoicism.htm |date=December 31, 2009 }}</ref>

Mohun Biswas, in the novel ''[[A House for Mr Biswas]]'' (1961), by [[V. S. Naipaul]], is pleased to think himself a follower of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius; the irony is that he never actually behaves as a Stoic.

"Everything has two handles, the one by which it may be carried, the other by which it cannot" is the theme of ''Disturbances in the Field'' (1983), by [[Lynne Sharon Schwartz]]. Lydia, the central character, turns often to ''The Golden Sayings of Epictetus'' – the latter being a modern selection from Epictetus's writings, compiled and translated by Hastings Crossley.

A line from the ''Enchiridion'' is used as a title quotation in ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' by [[Laurence Sterne]], which translates to, "Not things, but opinions about things, trouble men."<ref>Laurence Sterne, ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman'', ed. Ian Campbell Ross (Oxford Univ. Press, 1983), p. 540.</ref>

Epictetus is mentioned in ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' by [[James Joyce]]: in the fifth chapter of the novel the protagonist [[Stephen Dedalus]] discusses Epictetus's famous lamp with a dean of his college.<ref>pp. 202–203 of the Penguin Edition.</ref> Epictetus also is mentioned briefly in ''[[Franny and Zooey]]'' by [[J. D. Salinger]], and is referred to by [[Theodore Dreiser]] in his novel ''[[Sister Carrie]]''. Both the longevity of Epictetus's life and his philosophy are alluded to in [[John Berryman]]'s poem "Of Suicide".

Epictetus is referred to, but not mentioned by name, in [[Matthew Arnold]]'s [[sonnet]] "To a Friend". Arnold provides three historical personalities as his inspiration and support in difficult times (Epictetus is preceded by [[Homer]] and succeeded by [[Sophocles]]):

<blockquote><poem>Much he, whose friendship I not long since won,
That halting slave, who in Nicopolis
Taught Arrian, when Vespasian's brutal son
Cleared Rome of what most shamed him.<ref>Matthew Arnold, [http://www.poetry-online.org/arnold_to_a_friend.htm ''To A Friend'']</ref></poem></blockquote>

The title character in Julian Barnes's 2022 novel ''[[Elizabeth Finch (novel)|Elizabeth Finch]]'' impresses the teachings of Epictetus on her students.

In the Chapter XXX of [[François Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]]'' (c. 1532), Pantagruel's tutor Epistemon had his head cut off after a battle. After he had his head reattached and was brought back to life, he recounts his experience of the damned in hell:

{{quote|Their estate and condition of living is but only changed after a very strange manner;

...After this manner, those that had been great lords and ladies here, got but a poor scurvy wretched living there below. And, on the contrary, the philosophers and others, who in this world had been altogether indigent and wanting, were great lords there in their turn.

...I saw Epictetus there, most gallantly apparelled after the French fashion, sitting under a pleasant arbour, with store of handsome gentlewomen, frolicking, drinking, dancing, and making good cheer, with abundance of crowns of the sun. Above the lattice were written these verses for his device:

<poem>To leap and dance, to sport and play,
And drink good wine both white and brown,
Or nothing else do all the day
But tell bags full of many a crown.
</poem>

When he saw me, he invited me to drink with him very courteously, and I was willing to be entreated, tippled and chopined together most theologically. In the meantime came [[Cyrus]] to beg one farthing of him for the honour of Mercury, therewith to buy a few onions for his supper. No, no, said Epictetus, I do not use in my almsgiving to bestow farthings. Hold, thou varlet, there's a crown for thee; be an honest man."}}

Stockdale.jpg|alt=|thumb|Prisoner of war [[James Stockdale]] receiving the [[Medal of Honor]] from American president [[Gerald Ford]]; Stockdale claims he was able to retain his sanity during capture by relying on the philosophy of Epictetus]]

[[James Stockdale]], a [[fighter pilot]] who was shot down while serving in the [[Vietnam War]], was influenced by Epictetus. He was introduced to his works while at [[Stanford University]]. In ''Courage under Fire: Testing Epictetus's Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior'' (1993), Stockdale credits Epictetus with helping him endure his seven and a half years in captivity, which included torture and four years in [[solitary confinement]].<ref>Stockdale, James Bond. 1993. ''Courage Under Fire: Testing Epictetus's Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior.'' Stanford: Hoover Institution/Stanford University.</ref> When he was shot down, he reportedly said to himself "I'm leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus!" as he bailed out.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/08/guardianobituaries.usa Obituary: Vice Admiral James Stockdale] The Guardian 2005</ref>

Quoting Epictetus, Stockdale concludes the book with:

<blockquote>The emotions of grief, pity, and even affection are well-known disturbers of the soul. Grief is the most offensive; Epictetus considered the suffering of grief an act of evil. It is a willful act, going against the will of God to have all men share happiness.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stockdale |first=James B. |author-link=James Stockdale |date=1995 |title=Thoughts of a Philosophical Fighter Pilot |location=Stanford, Calif. |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |isbn=0817993916 |oclc=32625408}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Psychology ===
Psychologist [[Albert Ellis]], the founder of [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]], credited Epictetus with providing a foundation for his system of [[psychotherapy]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/ageless-guiltless |title=Ageless, Guiltless|last=Green|first=Adam|date=2003-10-13|magazine=The New Yorker}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2816649.ece |title=Albert Ellis: Psychotherapist who preached a rational, behavioural approach|last=Schatzman|first=Morton|date=2007-07-30|newspaper=The Independent|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018071619/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2816649.ece |archive-date=2007-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2146455,00.html|title=Albert Ellis: Influential American psychologist who led the revolution in cognitive therapy |last=Burkeman|first=Oliver|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2007-08-10}}</ref>

=== Religion ===
[[Kiyozawa Manshi]], a controversial reformer within the [[Higashi Honganji]] branch of [[Jodo Shinshu]] [[Buddhism]], cited Epictetus as one of the three major influences on his spiritual development and thought.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blum |first1=Mark L. |title=Kiyozawa Manshi and the Meaning of Buddhist Ethics |journal=The Eastern Buddhist |date=1988 |volume=21 |issue=1 |page=63 |issn=0012-8708 |jstor=44361820 |quote=A year after his study of the Āgamas, he received a copy of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus from his disciple Akegarasu Haya, and again Kiyozawa was deeply moved.}}</ref>
