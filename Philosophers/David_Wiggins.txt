He left the Civil Service and was Jane Eliza Proctor Visiting Fellow at [[Princeton University]] in 1958–9. Returning to Oxford, he was Lecturer, 1959, then Fellow and Lecturer, 1960–7, at [[New College, Oxford|New College]]. After that, he was Chair of Philosophy at [[Bedford College, London]], 1967–80; Fellow and Praelector in Philosophy at [[University College, Oxford]], 1981–9; and Professor of Philosophy at Birkbeck College, University of London, 1989–94; and Wykeham Professor of Logic and Fellow of New College, Oxford, 1994–2000.<ref>'Who's Who 2012, London, A. & C. Black, London : 2012, 2466)</ref>

Wiggins was made a [[fellow of the British Academy]] in 1978. He was also President of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1999 to 2000. He was elected a foreign honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1992.

== Philosophical work ==
Wiggins is well known for his work in [[metaphysics]], particularly identity. In his ''Sameness and Substance'' (Oxford, 1980), he proposed [[conceptualist realism]], a position according to which our conceptual framework maps reality.<ref>A. M. Ferner, ''Organisms and Personal Identity: Individuation and the Work of David Wiggins'', Routledge, 2016, p. 28.</ref> According to philosopher Harold Noonan:
{{blockquote|The most influential part of Wiggins's work has been in metaphysics, where he has developed a fundamentally [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] conception of substance, enriched by insights drawn from [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] (1975) and [[Naming and Necessity|Kripke (1980)]]. His works also contain influential discussions of the problem of [[personal identity]], which Wiggins elucidates ''via'' a conception that he calls the "Animal Attribute View."<ref>Noonan, H., 2005.  "David Wiggins."  In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Macmillan. [http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3446802122/wiggins-david-1933.html (excerpt)]</ref>}}

He has also made an influential contribution to [[ethics]]. His 2006 book, ''Ethics.  Twelve Lectures on the Philosophy of Morality'' defends a position he calls "moral objectivism".

He has written widely on other areas including [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], [[aesthetics]] and [[political philosophy]].

A Festschrift, ''Essays for David Wiggins'' was published in 1996.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Lovibond|editor1-first=Sabrina|editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=S.G.|title=Essays for David Wiggins: Identity, Truth and Value|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}</ref>
