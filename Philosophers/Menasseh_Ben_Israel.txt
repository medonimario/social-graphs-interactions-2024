'''Manoel Dias Soeiro''' ({{IPA|nl|maːˈnul ˈdijɑ(s) ˈsʋeːroː|lang}};{{Needs IPA|Ladino|lang=lad}} 1604&nbsp;– 20 November 1657), better known by his [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name '''Menasseh''' or '''Menashe ben Israel''' ({{lang|he|מנשה בן ישראל}}),{{efn|group=note|Also known as '''Menasheh ben Yossef ben Yisrael''' and by the acronym '''MB"Y''' or '''MBI'''.}} was a Jewish scholar, [[rabbi]], [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]], writer, diplomat, [[printer (publisher)|printer]], publisher, and founder of the first Hebrew [[printing press]] (named ''Emeth Meerets Titsmah'') in [[Amsterdam]] in 1626.

==Life==
[[File:Menasseh ben Israel.jpg|thumb|175px|left|A portrait etching by [[Rembrandt]] probably depicting Samuel Menasseh ben Israel, a son<ref>[[Cecil Roth]] published a massive biography of Menasseh ben Israel (Roth, 1934), where this etching is also printed. However, in his 1970 entry on MbI for the ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' (see Roth, 2007, below; Roth was editor in chief of the first edition of that encyclopedia in 1970) he wrote:
:His portrait was engraved by [[Salom Italia]] (1642). Whether a portrait etching by Rembrandt of 1636 (Bartsch 269) represents Manasseh is doubtful, and painted portraits of Manasseh by Rembrandt or by Ferdinand Bol are not known.
The whole story of the wrong identification of the subject of the etching is now summarized in Nadler, 2018, pp. 223-224. Here is Nadler's verdict on this alleged identification:
:The scholarly consensus now [2018], however, is that this is not a portrait of Menasseh ben Israel at all.</ref>]]

Menasseh was born in [[La Rochelle]]<ref>Cardozo de Bethencourt, [https://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/rjuiv_0484-8616_1904_num_49_97_4700.pdf « Lettres de Menasseh ben Israël à Isaac Vossius (1651-1655) »], ''Revue des études juives'', n. 49-97, 1904, p. 98.

The family moved to the [[Netherlands]] in 1610. The Netherlands was in the middle of a process of religious revolt against Catholic Spanish rule throughout the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648). Amsterdam was an important center of Jewish life in Europe at this time. The family's arrival in 1610 was during the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] mediated by [[France]] and [[England]] at [[The Hague]]. In Amsterdam he studied under [[Moses Raphael de Aguilar]].

Menasseh rose to eminence not only as a rabbi and an author, but also as a printer. He established the first Hebrew press in Holland. One of his earliest works, ''El Conciliador'', published in 1632,<ref>Menasseh Ben Israel. ''El Conciliador (The Conciliator)''. Amsterdam, 1632. Reprinted in ''The Conciliator of R.

Among his correspondents were [[Gerardus Vossius]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Petrus Serrarius]], [[António Vieira]] and [[Pierre Daniel Huet]]. In 1638, he decided to settle in [[Brazil]], as he still found it difficult to provide for his wife and family in Amsterdam. He may have visited the Dutch colony's capital of [[Recife]], but did not move there. One of the reasons his financial situation improved in Amsterdam was the arrival of two Portuguese Jewish entrepreneurs, the brothers [[Abraham Israel Pereyra|Abraham and Isaac Pereyra]]. They hired Rabbi Manasseh to direct a small college or academy (a ''yeshibah'' in Spanish-Portuguese parlance of the time) they had founded in the city.<ref>For the economic ties binding Manasseh Ben Israel's intellectual activities to the mercantile activities of the brothers Pereyra throughout the entire period, see {{cite book |last=Roth |first=Cecil |title=A Life of Manasseh Ben Israel, Rabbi, Printer, and Diplomat |location=Philadelphia |publisher=The Jewish Publication Society of America |year=1934 |pages=62–63 and 316–317 }}; and {{cite book |editor1-last=Méchoulan |editor1-first=Henry |editor2-last=Nahon |editor2-first=Gérard |title=Menasseh Ben Israel: The Hope of Israel.

In 1644, Menasseh met [[Antonio de Montezinos]], a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traveler and [[Marrano]] [[Sephardic Jew]] who had been in the New World. Montezinos convinced him of his conclusion that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|South America Andes' Indians]] were the descendants of the [[Ten Lost Tribes|lost ten tribes of Israel]]. This purported discovery gave a new impulse to Menasseh's [[messiah|Messianic]] hopes, as the settlement of Jews throughout the world was supposed to be a sign that the Messiah would come. Filled with this idea, he turned his attention to England, whence the Jews had been expelled since 1290. He worked to get them permission to settle there again and thus hasten the Messiah's coming.

With the start of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], the question of the readmission of the Jews had found increased [[Puritan]] support, but it was often mooted under the growing desire for religious liberty. In addition, Messianic and other mystic hopes were then current in England. His book, ''[https://archive.org/stream/menassehbenisrae00manauoft#page/16/mode/2up The Hope of Israel]'', was first published in Amsterdam in Latin (''Spes Israelis'') and in Spanish (''Esperança de Israel'') in 1650.<ref>Those were the two initial main languages used by Menasseh when addressing the general Christian public in Europe. The full title of the Latin edition was ''Mikveh Israel, hoc est Spes Israelis''. The Hebrew part of this full Latin name is taken from Jeremiah 14:8, as Menasseh explains in the introduction to the Spanish version. The English version was first published by Moses Wall in London only in 1652.''Cf.'' Méchoulan and Nahon, ''op. cit.'', pp. 60-62.</ref> The book was written in response to a 1648 letter from [[John Dury]] enquiring about Montezinos' claims. In addition to reporting Montezinos' accounts of Jews in the Americas, the book also expressed the hope that the Jews would return to England as a way of hastening the coming of the messiah. Menasseh also stresses his kinship with parliament, and explains himself as driven by amity for England rather than financial gain.<ref name=Crome2014>Crome, Andrew (2014).

In 1651 he offered to serve [[Christina, Queen of Sweden]] as her agent of Hebrew books. The same year he met [[Oliver St John]] and his envoys on his mission to secure an Anglo-Dutch coalition (which would have given Dutch citizens, and thus Jews, privileges to stay and work in England). The English were impressed by learning and manner, and advised him to formally apply for Jewish readmission to England.<ref>Sachar, Howard M. (1994).

And do we not see that those Republiques do flourish and much increase in trade who admit the Israelites?}}

[[Oliver Cromwell]] was sympathetic to the Jewish cause, partly because of his tolerant leanings but chiefly because he foresaw the importance for English commerce of the participation of the Jewish merchant princes, some of whom had already made their way to London. At this juncture, the English gave Jews full rights in the colony of [[Surinam (English colony)|Surinam]], which they had controlled since 1650. There is some debate among historians concerning whether Menasseh's motives for pursuing the readmission of the Jews by England were primarily political or religious. [[Ismar Schorsch]], for example, has argued that the idea of England being a final place for Jews to inhabit in order to bring about the coming of the Messiah was hardly present in ''The Hope of Israel'' (1652), but rather was developed by Menasseh later (1656-57 when he was in London) in order to appeal to English Christians with [[Millenarianism|Millenarian]] beliefs.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schorsch |first=Ismar |title=From Messianism to Realpolitik: Menasseh Ben Israel and the Readmission of the Jews to England |journal=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research |volume=45 |year=1978 |pages=187–200 |doi=10.2307/3622313 |jstor=3622313 }}</ref> Henry Méchoulan, on the other hand, in his later in-depth detailed analysis of the book has striven to show that the Jewish messianic theme in it is also rather fundamental to its initial conception.<ref>Méchoulan and Nahon, ''op. cit.'', pp. 76-81.</ref> [[Steven Nadler]], in his 2018 book, which is actually the last word on Menasseh's biography to be published to date, has seemingly also closed the debate on this issue of Menasseh's own messianic beliefs:
{{Blockquote|They [the sundry European Gentile [[Millenarians]] that were in contact with him] especially valued [Menasseh] as {{em|the}} Jewish expositor of a common [Jewish-Christian] Messianic vision, wherein the worldly empires will be swept away by a "Fifth Kingdom" [or ''[[Fifth Monarchy]]''] ruled by a savior sent by God.<ref name=Nadler>{{cite book |last=Nadler |first=Steven |title=Menasseh ben Israel, Rabbi of Amsterdam |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-0-300-22410-8 |page=3 }}</ref>}}

In November 1655, Menasseh arrived in London. During his absence from the Netherlands, the Amsterdam rabbis excommunicated his student, [[Baruch Spinoza]]. In London, Menasseh published his ''Humble Addresses to the Lord Protector'', but its effect was weakened by [[William Prynne]]'s publication of ''Short Demurrer''. Cromwell summoned the [[Whitehall Conference]] in December of the same year.

Some of the most notable statesmen, lawyers, and theologians of the day were summoned to this conference to discuss whether the Jews should be readmitted to England. The chief practical result was the declaration of judges Glynne and Steele that "there was no law which forbade the Jews' return to England" (as they had been expelled by royal decree of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]], and not by formal parliamentary action; Jews remaining in England lived, however, under constant threat of expulsion). Though nothing was done to regularize the position of the Jews, the door was opened to their gradual return. On 14 December 1655, [[John Evelyn]] entered in his ''[[John Evelyn's Diary|Diary]],'' "Now were the Jews admitted."{{refn|John Evelyn's diary entry for 14 December 1655.<br>

Archive.org p.307</ref>|group=note}} When Prynne and others attacked the Jews, Menasseh wrote his major work, ''[[Vindiciae judaeorum]]'' (1656), in response.

Menasseh ben Israel stayed in England for close to two years after the Whitehall Conference. During this time he tried to obtain written permission for the resettlement of the Jews in England. Although he failed in this endeavour, during his stay he met with a large number of influential figures of the age, including Cambridge theologian [[Ralph Cudworth]], [[Henry Oldenburg]], [[Robert Boyle]] and his sister, [[Adam Boreel]], [[John Sadler (Town Clerk of London)|John Sadler]], [[John Dury]] and [[Samuel Hartlib]], as well as more marginal prophetic figures such as [[Ambrose Barnes]] and [[Arise Evans]]. Ben Israel's stay was managed by the [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] [[philosemite]] Baptist clergyman [[Henry Jessey]].<ref>Katz, David S. (1989).

[[File:De Resurrectione Mortuorum, Menassah Ben Israel.jpg|thumb|200px|''De Resurrectione Mortuorum'' by Menassah Ben Israel]]
Menasseh ben Israel was the author of many works. His major work ''Nishmat Hayim'' is a treatise in Hebrew on the Jewish concept of [[gilgul|reincarnation of souls]], published by his son Samuel six years before they both died.<ref>At least some parts of that work were translated into English by Dr. Raphael Polyakov and are [http://raphael.eu.pn/nh/spirits.htm#nhcdzmw available at http://raphael.eu.pn].</ref> Some scholars think that he studied kabbalah with [[Abraham Cohen de Herrera]], a disciple of [[Israel Sarug|Israel Saruk]]. This would explain his familiarity with the method of [[Isaac Luria]].

To achieve this aim, Ben Israel "utilized an astounding range of sources"; primarily the [[Talmud]] and the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible#Commentaries|classic Jewish commentaries]] but frequently quotes from the early Christian authorities as well as Greek and Latin authors of antiquity. Written in Spanish, in Amsterdam, 1632,  it was aimed primarily to strengthen the faith of the [[Marranos]] in the veracity of the Tanach according to Jewish interpretation.<ref>[http://www.eichlers.com/the-conciliator-hardcover.html Sepher-Hermon Press - Product Description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714123444/http://www.eichlers.com/the-conciliator-hardcover.html |date=14 July 2014 }}.</ref>  It was translated by [[Elias Haim Lindo]] and published by Duncan and Malcolm, in 1842, and again in 1972, with footnotes and introductory material by Sepher-Hermon Press.<ref>Kitto - The first volume was translated into Latin by Vossius, Amst. 1633, and the whole has been translated in English by Lindo, London 1842.</ref>

==Descendants==
Menasseh's wife, Rachel, was a descendant of the [[Isaac Abarbanel|Abarbanel]] family. Menasseh had three children by her.  According to family legend, the Abarbanels were descendants of King David, and he was proud of his children's Davidic ancestry.<ref>[[Albert Montefiore Hyamson]], ''A History of the Jews in England'' (1908), p. 182</ref>  Both of Menasseh's sons predeceased their father.  Menasseh's eldest son was Samuel Abarbanel Soeiro, also known as Samuel Ben Israel, who worked as a printer and assisted his father with matters in England.  He died in 1657.  Menasseh's youngest son, Joseph, died at age 20, in 1650, on a disastrous business trip to Poland.   Menasseh also had a daughter, Gracia, born 1628, who married Samuel Abarbanel Barboza in 1646, and died in 1690.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

[[Moses Jacob Ezekiel]], the American sculptor, in his autobiography claimed to be a descendant of Menasseh Ben Israel. His claim is unconfirmed.
