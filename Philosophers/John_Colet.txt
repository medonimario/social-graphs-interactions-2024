'''John Colet''' (January 1467 – 16 September 1519) was an English [[Catholic priest]] and educational pioneer.

Colet was an English scholar, [[Renaissance humanist]], theologian, member of the [[Worshipful Company of Mercers]], and Dean of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]], London. Colet wanted people to see the scripture as their guide through life. Furthermore, he wanted to restore theology and rejuvenate Christianity. Colet is an important early leader of Christian humanism as he linked humanism and reform. John Colet was a friend of [[Erasmus]], a key figure in [[Christian humanism]].

==Childhood and education==
The eldest son of Sir [[Henry Colet]] ([[Lord Mayor of London]] 1486 and 1495), he was born in London in January 1467, and was educated at St Anthony's school and at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he took his M.A. in 1490. He was already nonresident rector of Dennington, [[Suffolk]], and vicar of St Dunstan's, [[Stepney (parish)|Stepney]], and now became rector of Thurning, Hunts. In 1493 he went to [[Paris, France|Paris]] and then to Italy, studying [[canon law|canon]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[patristics]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=681}}

==Time abroad==
During his time abroad he became acquainted with Budaeus ([[Guillaume Budé]]) and [[Erasmus]], and with the teaching of [[Savonarola]]. On his return to England in 1496 he took orders and settled at [[Oxford, England|Oxford]], where he lectured on the epistles of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], replacing the old scholastic method of interpretation with one more in harmony with the [[new learning]]. Due to their influences, when he arrived back in England, he returned more than just a humanist; he returned a Christian reformer. His methods did much to influence Erasmus, who visited Oxford in 1498, and who later received an annuity from Colet.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=681}}

==Holding office==
[[File:EB1911 Plate IV. v24, pg.505, Fig 9.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Dean Colet by Sir [[William Hamo Thornycroft]].<ref>[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], ed. 1911, volume 24, pg. 505, Plate IV.</ref>]]
Since 1494, Colet had been [[prebendary]] of York, and canon of St Martin le Grand, London.  In 1502 he became prebendary of Salisbury, in 1505 prebendary of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]], and immediately afterwards its [[List of Deans of St Paul's|dean]], having previously taken the degree of doctor of divinity. He continued to lecture on the books of the Bible; and he soon afterwards established a perpetual [[divinity]] lecture, three days each week, in St Paul's itself.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=681}} While at St. Paul's between 1505 and 1519, Colet used his preaching, administration, [[scriptural exegesis]] and education towards Church reform.

Around 1508, having inherited his father's wealth, Colet formed his plan for the re-foundation of [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]], which he completed in 1512, and endowed with estates of an annual value of £122 and upwards.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=681}} The school, dedicated to the Infant Jesus, was in place to give young boys a Christian education.

The celebrated grammarian [[William Lilye]] was the first master, and the [[Worshipful Company of Mercers|company of mercers]] were (in 1510) appointed trustees, the first example of non-clerical management in education. Some held Colet's religious opinions to be [[Heresy|heretical]], but [[William Warham]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], refused to prosecute him. King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] also held him in high esteem despite his sermons against the French wars.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=681}}

Colet was rector of the guild of Jesus at [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]] and chaplain to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. In 1514 he made the [[Pilgrims' Way|Canterbury pilgrimage]] and in 1515 preached at [[Thomas Wolsey|Wolsey]]'s installation as cardinal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=681}}

==Sermons==
Colet had many distinguished sermons. One is the beginning of the Convocation of the clergy of [[Canterbury]] province at St Paul's Cathedral on 6 February 1512. [[William Warham|Archbishop Warham of Canterbury]] invited Colet to make the speech. Colet's speech is both direct and insightful. It represents his work, or as Colet said himself, he is "speaking out of zeal, a man sorrowing for the ruin of the Church". Furthermore, Colet stated that he came "…here today, fathers, to admonish you with all your minds to deliberate, in this your Council, concerning the reformation of the Church". The [[Convocation|Convocation sermon]] is one of the most well known of his sermons. In addition, Colet gave a notable sermon before the royal court on [[Good Friday|Good Friday, 1513]]. He gave this speech in the wake of political tension; specifically, an English push for war against France. In his speech, Colet condemned war and prompted Christians to fight only for Jesus Christ.

==A Christian humanist==
Colet's writings are reflective and added to the tradition of Christian humanism. He studied [[Writings of Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]], [[Augustine of Hippo#Works|Augustine]], [[Jerome#Theological writings|Jerome]], [[John Chrysostom#Writings|John Chrysostom]], [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Lactantius#Works|Lactantius]] and [[Polycarp]].<ref>"Colet, John (1467–1519)", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (2004)  Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-198-61411-1}}</ref>

In his writings, Colet refers to [[Italian humanists]] and Platonists [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]].

Erasmus said of Colet, "When I listen to Colet it seems to me that I am listening to Plato himself."<ref>Erasmus to John Fisher, 5 December 1499. Erasmus, ''The Correspondence'', 1: 235. Ed. [[Beatrice Corrigan]] et als. Toronto: The University of Toronto Press, 1974.</ref> [[Erasmus]] likely portrayed Colet to show that one could be highly critical of the Church while still a loyal priest. His depiction of Colet was partly a depiction of himself.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Studied over time==
[[File:BioDrJohnColet1724.jpg|thumb|250px|Frontispiece and titlepage of "The Life of Dr John Colet", Dean of St Paul's" by Samuel Knight, 1724.]]
Colet has been studied frequently over time and has experienced resurgences in popularity. [[White Kennett|Bishop Kennett]] studied Colet during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Kennett passed his notes to [[Samuel Knight (clergyman)|Samuel Knight]] who used them to write a biography of Colet which was published in 1724. During the nineteenth century, interest in Colet increased. Several editions of his works and an additional biography were published during that time. Scholars believed Colet strongly impacted his friend Erasmus and the English Reformation. Later critics went on to view Colet as Protestant-like, though others believe that Colet was merely a reform preacher that wanted to improve the quality of the Church.

Colet died in 1519 of the "[[sweating sickness]]." His monument was erected on the south aisle of the choir at the cathedral church of Saint Paul but destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]].<ref name=dimock>{{cite book|last1=Dimock|first1=Arthur|title=The Cathedral Church of St Paul|date=1900|publisher=George Bell & Sons|location=London|page=20|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25266/25266-h/25266-h.htm#CHAPTER_II}}</ref>

==Other works==
In addition to his sermons Colet's works include some scriptural commentary and works entitled ''Daily Devotions'' and ''Monition to a Godly Life''.  Together with Lilye, Erasmus, and Wolsey, Colet produced materials forming the basis of the authorised Latin Grammar, used for centuries in the English schools.  A number of letters from Colet to Erasmus also survive.

==Lasting influence of Colet==
To this day, Colet's achievement is celebrated by [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]], [[St Paul's Girls' School]] and [[St Paul's Juniors]] (formerly known as Colet Court) on John Colet Day at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] (having begun in 2003).

The [[John Colet School]] in [[Wendover]], [[Buckinghamshire]] is named after him, as well as Colet Gardens, a road in the London suburb of [[Hammersmith]], [[W postcode area|W6]], and John Colet School in Sydney, Australia.

==Colet's convocation sermon (1512)==
In the introductory paragraph, Colet concludes by stating that his presence is due to the need for the Council to consider a Church reformation. First, Colet criticises the living style of the priests. Colet explains that the priests should set an example for others as be a beacon of light, because if they are instead figures of darkness, the Church will be engulfed by darkness. Colet cites four evils, referencing the Apostle, that constitute the corrupt, priestly living: devilish pride, carnal concupiscence, worldly covetousness, and worldly occupations.

First, in regard to pride of life, Colet believes that priests of the day were more consumed by the honour and dignity one could receive by being a part of the priesthood. Service to the Church must be only humble service.

Secondly, many priests take part in the lust for the flesh: feasting and banqueting, vain conversation, sports, plays, hunting, and hawking. They are "drowned in the delights of this world" and "patronize those who cater for their pleasure".

Thirdly, covetousness is the third worldly evil, which is also known as lust. Colet calls this a plague that has overtaken many priests and blinded many. Many take part in the Church only for the hope of riches and promotions. Priests forget that they should be interested in the good they can do more than the amount of riches that they stand to gain. Paul called covetousness the root of all evils. From it, benefices stack up, including pensions and tithes. Colet states that: "every corruption, all the ruin of the Church, all the scandals of the world, come from the covetousness of priests".

The fourth evil arises because priests have become more servants of men than servants of God.  According to [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], priests are supposed to be an intermediary between men and God. As such, warfare should only be spiritual in nature and reflective of Jesus. In addition, they need to pray, read, and meditate regarding the [[Scriptures]]. They must deliver the word of God, give the sacraments of salvation, make sacrifices for people, and hold masses for people's souls.

Colet then moves on to discuss the needed clergy reform. Paul orders that people must "be reformed into a new mind". People should turn to humility, sobriety, charity, and spiritual occupations. Reform must begin with the priests so that it can spread throughout the Church. Colet disagrees with the creation of new laws; instead he thinks that the old laws must simply be enforced.

Colet believes several things are important: a good, pure, and holy life, approved morals, moderate knowledge of the Scriptures, knowledge of the Sacraments, the fear of God and love of the heavenly life.

Finally, Colet urges people to "return to the God of love and peace; return to Christ, in whom is the true peace of the Spirit which passeth all understanding; return to the true priestly life". "Be ye reformed in the newness of your minds, that ye may know those things which are of God; and the peace of God shall be with you".

==Memorial==
There was a memorial to him in the [[aisle|south aisle]] at [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]].<ref>"Memorials of St Paul's Cathedral" [[William Sinclair (Archdeacon of London)|Sinclair, W.]] p93: London; Chapman & Hall, Ltd; 1909</ref>

A bronze statue of John Colet with two pupils, made by [[Hamo Thornycroft]] in 1902, has a prominent position near the entrance of [[St Paul's School, London]].
