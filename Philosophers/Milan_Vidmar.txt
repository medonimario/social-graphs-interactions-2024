'''Milan Vidmar''' (22 June 1885 – 9 October 1962) was a [[Slovenia]]n [[electrical engineer]], chess player, [[Chess theory|chess theorist]], and writer. He was among the top dozen chess players in the world from 1910 to 1930 and in 1950, was among the inaugural recipients of the title [[Grandmaster (chess)|International Grandmaster]] from [[FIDE]]. Vidmar was a specialist in [[Electric power|power]] [[transformer]]s and [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[electric current]].

==Early life, family, and education==
He was born in a middle-class family in [[Ljubljana]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (now in [[Slovenia]]). He began to study [[mechanical engineering]] in 1902, and he graduated in 1907 from the [[University of Vienna]]. He got his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctor's degree]] in 1911 from the Technical faculty in Vienna. The study of [[electrical engineering]] at the Technical faculty did not begin until 1904, so Vidmar had to take special examinations in the field basics.

Between 1912 and 1913 he worked at the famous [[Ganz Works]] in Budapest as the assistant of [[Ottó Titusz Bláthy]], one of the inventors and foremost experts on transformers which in turn became Vidmar's specialisation too.<ref>[http://www.cesa-project.eu/en/lexicon/authors/milan-vidmar Milan Vidmar]. Central European Science Adventure.</ref>

He was a professor at the [[University of Ljubljana]], a member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the founder of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. Between 1928 and 1929 he was the 10th chancellor of the University of Ljubljana. In 1948 he established the Institute of Electrotechnics that now bears his name.<ref>{{cite web | title=Elektroinštitut Milan Vidmar | url=https://www.eimv.si/eng/ | access-date=April 8, 2018 | archive-date=9 April 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409043114/https://www.eimv.si/eng/ | url-status=dead }}</ref>
