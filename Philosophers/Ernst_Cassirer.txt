Trained within the [[Neo-Kantian]] Marburg School, he initially followed his mentor [[Hermann Cohen]] in attempting to supply an idealistic [[philosophy of science]].

After Cohen's death in 1918, Cassirer developed a theory of symbolism and used it to expand [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[epistemology|knowledge]] into a more general [[philosophy of culture]]. Cassirer was one of the leading 20th-century advocates of philosophical [[idealism]]. His most famous work is the ''Philosophy of Symbolic Forms'' (1923–1929).

Though his work received a mixed reception shortly after his death, more recent scholarship has remarked upon Cassirer's role as a strident defender of the [[moral idealism]] of the [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]] and the cause of [[liberal democracy]] at a time when the rise of [[fascism]] had made such advocacy unfashionable. Within the international Jewish community, Cassirer's work has additionally been seen as part of a long tradition of thought on ethical philosophy.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/book-1-ernst-cassirer-the-last-philosopher-of-culture-book-2-the-symbolic-construction-of-reality-the-legacy-of-ernst-cassirer/|access-date=April 13, 2020|title=(Book 1) Ernst Cassirer: The Last Philosopher of Culture; (Book 2) The Symbolic Construction of Reality: The Legacy of Ernst Cassirer|first=Peter E.|last=Gordon|periodical=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|date=8 September 2009 }}</ref>

==Biography==
Cassirer was born in [[Wrocław|Breslau]] in [[Silesia Province|Silesia]] (modern-day southwest Poland), into a [[Jew]]ish family. After graduating from [[:de:Johannesgymnasium Breslau|Johannesgymnasium Breslau
]] he studied Jurisprudence at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelms Universität Berlin]] and [[Leipzig University]], Germanic Philology, Contemporary Literary History, and Philosophy at [[Heidelberg University|Ruprecht Karls Universität Heidelberg]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelms Universität Berlin]], and Philosophy and Psychology at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. He then did his doctoral work at [[University of Marburg]] where he studied Philosophy under [[Hermann Cohen]] and [[Paul Natorp]] and Mathematics under [[Friedrich Schottky]].<ref>1945 Curriculum Vitae, Ernst Cassirer Papers - Addition. General Collection, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University. </ref> In 1899 he graduated with a dissertation on [[René Descartes]]'s analysis of mathematical and natural scientific knowledge entitled {{lang|de|Descartes' Kritik der mathematischen und naturwissenschaftlichen Erkenntnis}} [''Descartes' Critique of Mathematical and Scientific Knowledge'']) and completed his [[habilitation]] in 1906 at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] with the dissertation {{lang|de|Das Erkenntnisproblem in der Philosophie und Wissenschaft der neueren Zeit: Erster Band}} [''The Problem of Knowledge in Philosophy and Science in the Modern Age: Volume I'']).<ref>A second volume appeared in 1907, a third one in 1920, and a fourth one in 1957.</ref>

Politically, Cassirer supported the liberal [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Larry Eugene |title=Crossing Boundaries: The Exclusion and Inclusion of Minorities in Germany and the United States |date=2001 |publisher=Berghahn Books |page=125}}</ref> After working for many years as a {{lang|de|[[Privatdozent]]}} at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin, Cassirer was elected in 1919 to the philosophy chair at the newly founded [[University of Hamburg]], where he lectured until 1933, supervising amongst others the doctoral theses of [[Joachim Ritter]] and [[Leo Strauss]]. 
On 30 January 1933, the [[Nazi Regime]] [[Machtergreifung|came to power]]. Cassirer left Germany on 12 March 1933 – one week after the first [[March 1933 German federal election|Reichstagswahl]] under that Regime – because he was Jewish.<ref>[[Die Zeit]] 4/2020: [https://www.zeit.de/hamburg/2020-04/ernst-cassirer-philosoph-universitaet-hamburg-antisemitismus/komplettansicht ''Der Geistesgegenwärtige'']</ref>

After leaving Germany he taught for a couple of years at the [[University of Oxford]], before becoming a professor at [[Gothenburg University]]. When Cassirer considered Sweden too unsafe, he applied for a post at [[Harvard University]], but was rejected because thirty years earlier he had rejected a job offer from them.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In 1941 he became a visiting professor at [[Yale University]], then moved to [[Columbia University]] in New York City, where he lectured from 1943 until his death in 1945.

Cassirer died of a heart attack in April 1945 in New York City. The young rabbi [[Arthur Hertzberg]], who was a student of Cassirer's at Columbia University, conducted the funeral service.<ref>Arthur Hertzberg: ''A Reminiscence of Ernst Cassirer'' The Leo Back Institute Year Book, Volume 15, Issue 1, January 1970, pp.245-246, [https://doi.org/10.1093/leobaeck/15.1.245]</ref> His grave is located in [[Westwood, New Jersey]], on the [[Cedar Park Cemetery, New Jersey|Cedar Park Beth–El Cemeteries]] in the graves of the Congregation Habonim. His son, [[Heinz Cassirer]], was also a Kantian scholar. 

Other members of his prominent family included the neurologist [[Richard Cassirer]], the publisher and gallery owner [[Bruno Cassirer]] and the art dealer and editor [[Paul Cassirer]].

==Influences==
Donald Phillip Verene, who published some of Cassirer's papers kept at Yale University, gave this overview of his ideas:
<blockquote>"Cassirer as a thinker became an embodiment of Kantian principles, but also of much more, of an overall movement of spirit stretching from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment, and on to Herder’s conception of history, Goethe’s poetry, Wilhelm von Humboldt’s study of the Kavi language, Schelling’s {{lang|de|Philosophie Der Mythologie}}, Hegel’s ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', and Vischer’s conception of the aesthetic symbol, among many others. Cassirer’s own position is born through a mastery of the whole development of this world of the humanistic understanding, which included the rise of the scientific world view &mdash; a mastery evident both in his historical works and in his systematic philosophy."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cassirer|first1=Ernst|editor1-last=Verene|editor1-first=Donald Phillip|title=Symbol, Myth, and Culture: Essays and Lectures of Ernst Cassirer 1935-1945|url=https://archive.org/details/symbolmythcultur0000cass |url-access=registration |date=1979 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=0-300-02666-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/symbolmythcultur0000cass/page/6 6–7]}}</ref></blockquote>

==Work==

===History of science===
Cassirer's first major published writings were a [[history of science|history of modern thought]] from the Renaissance to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. In accordance with his Marburg neo-Kantianism he concentrated upon epistemology. His reading of the [[Scientific Revolution]], in books such as ''The Individual and the Cosmos in Renaissance Philosophy'' (1927), as a "Platonic" application of mathematics to nature, influenced historians such as [[E. A. Burtt]], [[E. J. Dijksterhuis]], and [[Alexandre Koyré]].

===Philosophy of science===
In ''Substance and Function'' (1910), he writes about late nineteenth-century developments in physics including [[relativity theory]] and the [[foundations of mathematics]]. In ''Einstein's Theory of Relativity'' (1921) he defended the claim that modern physics supports a neo-Kantian [[conception of knowledge]]. He also wrote a book about [[Quantum mechanics]] called ''Determinism and Indeterminism in Modern Physics'' (1936).

===Philosophy of symbolic forms===
At Hamburg Cassirer discovered the Library of the Cultural Sciences founded by [[Aby Warburg]]. Warburg was an art historian who was particularly interested in ritual and myth as sources of surviving forms of emotional expression. In ''Philosophy of Symbolic Forms'' (1923–29) Cassirer argues that man (as he put it in his more popular 1944 book ''Essay on Man'') is a "[[symbolicum|symbolic animal]]". Whereas animals perceive their world by [[instinct]]s and direct [[sensory perception]], humans create a universe of [[symbol]]ic meanings. Cassirer is particularly interested in natural language and myth. He argues that science and mathematics developed from natural language, and religion and art from myth.

===The Cassirer–Heidegger debate===
{{Main|Cassirer–Heidegger debate}}
In 1929 Cassirer took part in a historically significant encounter with [[Martin Heidegger]] in [[Davos]] during the Second [[Davos Hochschulkurs]] (the [[Cassirer–Heidegger debate]]). Cassirer argues that while Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' emphasizes human temporality and finitude, he also sought to situate human cognition within a broader conception of humanity. Cassirer challenges Heidegger's relativism by invoking the universal validity of truths discovered by the exact and moral sciences.

===''Philosophy of the Enlightenment''===
Cassirer believed that reason's [[self-realization]] leads to human liberation. Mazlish (2000){{citation needed|date=August 2019}}, however, notes that Cassirer in his ''The Philosophy of the Enlightenment'' (1932) focuses exclusively on ideas, ignoring the political and social context in which they were produced.

===''The Logic of the Cultural Sciences''===
In ''The Logic of the Cultural Sciences'' (1942) Cassirer argues that objective and universal validity can be achieved not only in the sciences, but also in practical, cultural, moral, and aesthetic phenomena. Although inter-subjective objective validity in the natural sciences derives from universal laws of nature, Cassirer asserts that an analogous type of inter-subjective objective validity takes place in the cultural sciences.

===''The Myth of the State''===
Cassirer's last work, ''The Myth of the State'' (1946), was published posthumously; at one level it is an attempt to understand the intellectual origins of [[Nazi Germany]]. Cassirer sees Nazi Germany as a society in which the dangerous power of myth is not checked or subdued by superior forces. The book discusses the opposition of [[logos]] and [[mythology|mythos]] in Greek thought, [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', the medieval theory of the state, [[Machiavelli]], [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s writings on [[Great Man theory|hero worship]], the racial theories of [[Arthur de Gobineau]], and [[Hegel]]. Cassirer claimed that in 20th-century politics there was a return, with the passive acquiescence of [[Martin Heidegger]], to the irrationality of myth, and in particular to a belief that there is such a thing as destiny. Of this passive acquiescence, Cassirer says that in departing from Husserl's belief in an objective, logical basis for philosophy, Heidegger attenuated the ability of philosophy to oppose the resurgence of myth in German politics of the 1930s.
