Mendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants: plant height, pod shape and color, seed shape and color, and flower position and color. Taking seed color as an example, Mendel showed that when a true-breeding yellow pea and a true-breeding green pea were cross-bred, their offspring always produced yellow seeds. However, in the next generation, the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow. To explain this phenomenon, Mendel coined the terms "[[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]]" and "[[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]]" in reference to certain traits. In the preceding example, the green trait, which seems to have vanished in the first filial generation, is recessive, and the yellow is dominant. He published his work in 1866, demonstrating the actions of invisible "factors"—now called [[gene]]s—in predictably determining the traits of an organism.

The profound significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century (more than three decades later) with the rediscovery of his laws. [[Erich von Tschermak]], [[Hugo de Vries]] and [[Carl Correns]] independently verified several of Mendel's experimental findings in 1900, ushering in the modern age of genetics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gayon|first=Jean|date=2016|title=From Mendel to epigenetics: History of genetics|journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies|volume=339|issue=7–8|pages=225–230|doi=10.1016/j.crvi.2016.05.009|pmid=27263362|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Corcos|first1=Alain F.|last2=Monaghan|first2=Floyd V.|date=1990|title=Mendel's work and its rediscovery: A new perspective|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07352689009382287|journal=Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences|volume=9|issue=3|pages=197–212|doi=10.1080/07352689009382287|bibcode=1990CRvPS...9..197C }}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Mendel was born into a [[Sudeten Germans|German-speaking]] family in [[Hynčice (Vražné)|Heinzendorf bei Odrau]],<ref name="card"/> in [[Austrian Silesia|Silesia]], [[Austrian Empire]] (now Hynčice in the [[Czech Republic]]).<ref name=":4" /> He was the son of Anton and Rosine (Schwirtlich) Mendel and had one older sister, Veronika, and one younger, Theresia. They lived and worked on a farm which had been owned by the Mendel family for at least 130 years<ref>Gregor Mendel, Alain F. Corcos, Floyd V. Monaghan, Maria C. Weber "Gregor Mendel's Experiments on Plant Hybrids: A Guided Study", Rutgers University Press, 1993.</ref> (the house where Mendel was born is now a museum devoted to Mendel).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mendel-rodnydum.vrazne.cz/index.php?lang=cs |title=Úvod – Rodný dům Johanna Gregora Mendela}}</ref> During his childhood, Mendel worked as a gardener and studied [[beekeeping]]. As a young man, he attended [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Troppau]] ({{langx|cs|Opava}}). Due to illness, he had to take four months off during his gymnasium studies.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Camarena |first=Belia |date=March 20, 2018 |title=Gregor Mendel, the Father of Modern Genetics: Brilliant Scientist or Complete Failure? |url=https://stmuscholars.org/gregor-mendel-the-father-of-modern-genetics-brilliant-scientist-or-complete-failure/ |access-date=10 March 2023 |website=StMU Research Scholars}}</ref> From 1840 to 1843, he studied practical and theoretical philosophy and physics at the Philosophical Institute of the [[Palacký University Olomouc|University of Olomouc]] ({{langx|de|Olmütz}}), taking another year off because of illness. He also struggled financially to pay for his studies, and Theresia gave him her dowry.

== Academic career ==
[[File:Zawadzki and Mendel.jpg|left|thumb|Mendel (seated second from right and numbered "2") with other faculty at the Brno Realschule in 1864 ([[Aleksander Zawadzki (naturalist)|Alexander Zawadzki]] is labelled "1".)]]
When Mendel entered the Faculty of Philosophy, the Department of Natural History and Agriculture was headed by [[Johann Karl Nestler]], who conducted extensive research on hereditary traits of plants and animals, especially sheep. Upon recommendation of his [[physics]] teacher [[Friedrich Franz]],<ref name="Hasan">{{Cite book |last=Hasan |first=Heather |title=Mendel and The Laws Of Genetics|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2004  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXcRCag4rR8C&q=gregor+mendel+friedrich+franza&pg=PA1842|isbn =978-1-4042-0309-9 }}</ref> Mendel entered the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[St Thomas's Abbey, Brno|St Thomas's Abbey]] in [[Brno]] and began his training as a priest. Mendel worked as a substitute high school teacher. In 1850, he failed his exams' oral part, the last of three parts, to become a certified high school teacher. In 1851, he was sent to the [[University of Vienna]] to study under the sponsorship of [[Abbot]] [[Cyril František Napp]] so that he could get a more formal education.{{sfn|Henig|2000|p=24}} At Vienna, his professor of physics was [[Christian Doppler]].<ref name="Mathofinheritance" /> Mendel returned to his abbey in 1853 as a teacher, principally of physics.

After he was elevated as abbot in 1868, his scientific work largely ended, as Mendel became overburdened with administrative responsibilities, especially a dispute with the civil government over its attempt to impose special taxes on religious institutions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Windle |first =B.C.A. |others=Looby, John (trans.) |title=Mendel, Mendelism |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |year=1911 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10180b.htm |access-date=2 April 2007 }}</ref> Mendel died on 6 January 1884, at the age of 61, in [[Brno]],<ref name="card"/> from chronic [[nephritis]].

After initial experiments with pea plants, Mendel settled on studying seven traits that seemed to be inherited independently of other traits: seed shape, flower color, seed coat tint, pod shape, unripe pod color, flower location, and plant height. He first focused on seed shape, which was either angular or round.{{sfn|Henig|2000|pp=78–80}} Between 1856 and 1863 Mendel cultivated and tested some 28,000 plants, the majority of which were [[pea]] plants (''[[Pisum sativum]]'').<ref>{{cite book|last1=Magner|first1=Lois N. |title=History of the Life Sciences|year=2002 |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York|isbn=978-0-203-91100-6|page=380|edition=3, revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC&pg=PA380}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gros|first1=Franc̜ois|title=The Gene Civilization|year=1992|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-024963-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/genecivilization00gros/page/28 28]|edition=English|url=https://archive.org/details/genecivilization00gros|url-access=registration}}</ref><ref name="Moore-2003">{{Cite journal|last=Moore |first=Randy |title=The "Rediscovery" of Mendel's Work |journal=Bioscene |year=2001 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=13–24 |url=https://www.cs.uml.edu/~grinstei/91.510/Rediscovery%20of%20Mendel.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216153032/http://courses.pbsci.ucsc.edu/mcdb/bio105/Spring15/Lecture2/Rediscovery%20of%20Mendel.pdf |archive-date=16 February 2016 }}</ref> This study showed that, when true-breeding different varieties were crossed to each other (e.g., tall plants fertilized by short plants), in the second generation, one in four pea plants had [[purebred]] [[recessive]] [[Phenotypic trait|traits]], two out of four were [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], and one out of four were purebred [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]].

==== Initial reception of Mendel's work ====
Mendel presented his paper, {{lang|de|Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden}} ("[[Experiments on Plant Hybridization]]"), at two meetings of the Natural History Society of Brno in [[Moravia]] on 8 February and 8 March 1865.{{sfn|Henig|2000|pp=134–138}} It generated a few favorable reports in local newspapers,<ref name="Moore-2003" /> but was ignored by the scientific community. When Mendel's paper was published in 1866 in {{lang|de|[[Proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn|Verhandlungen des naturforschenden Vereines in Brünn]]}},<ref>Mendel, J.G. (1866). "[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/124139#page/133/mode/1up Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden]", ''Verhandlungen des naturforschenden Vereines in Brünn'', Bd.

==== Rediscovery of Mendel's work ====
About forty scientists listened to Mendel's two groundbreaking lectures, but it would appear that they failed to understand the implications of his work. Later, he also carried on a correspondence with [[Carl Nägeli]], one of the leading biologists of the time, but Nägeli also failed to appreciate Mendel's discoveries. At times, Mendel must have entertained doubts about his work, but not always: "My time will come," he reportedly told a friend,<ref name=":0" /> Gustav von Niessl.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Gustafsson|first=A.|date=1969|title=The life of Gregor Johann Mendel--tragic or not?|journal=Hereditas|volume=62|issue=1|pages=239–258|doi=10.1111/j.1601-5223.1969.tb02232.x|pmid=4922561|doi-access=free}}</ref>

During Mendel's lifetime, most biologists held the idea that all characteristics were passed to the next generation through [[blending inheritance]] (indeed, many effectively are), in which the traits from each parent are averaged.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weldon|first=W. F. R.|date=1902|title=Mendel's Laws of Alternative Inheritance in Peas|url=https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/biomet/1.2.228|journal=Biometrika|volume=1|issue=2|pages=228–233|doi=10.1093/biomet/1.2.228}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bulmer|first=Michael|date=1999|title=The Development of Francis Galton's Ideas on the Mechanism of Heredity|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1023/A:1004608217247|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|volume=32|issue=2|pages=263–292|doi=10.1023/A:1004608217247|pmid=11624207|s2cid=10451997}}</ref> Instances of this phenomenon are now explained by the action of multiple genes with [[Quantitative genetics|quantitative effects]]. Charles Darwin tried unsuccessfully to explain inheritance through a theory of [[pangenesis]]. It was not until the early 20th century that the importance of Mendel's ideas was realized.<ref name="Moore-2003" />

By 1900, research aimed at finding a successful theory of discontinuous inheritance rather than [[blending inheritance]] led to independent duplication of his work by [[Hugo de Vries]] and [[Carl Correns]] and the rediscovery of Mendel's writings and laws. Both acknowledged Mendel's priority, and it is thought probable that de Vries did not understand the results he had found until after reading Mendel.<ref name="Moore-2003" /> Though [[Erich von Tschermak]] was originally also credited with rediscovery, this is no longer accepted because he did not understand [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendel's laws]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Mayr E. |author-link=Ernst Mayr |year=1982 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought |location=Cambridge |publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-36446-2 |page=730}}</ref> Though de Vries later lost interest in Mendelism, other biologists started to establish modern genetics as a science. All three of these researchers, each from a different country, published their rediscovery of Mendel's work within a two-month span in the spring of 1900.{{sfn|Henig|2000|pp=1–9}}

Mendel's results were quickly replicated, and genetic linkage quickly worked out. Biologists flocked to the theory; even though it was not yet applicable to many phenomena, it sought to give a [[genotype|genotypic]] understanding of heredity, which they felt was lacking in previous studies of heredity, which had focused on [[phenotype|phenotypic]] approaches.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mendel's Legacy: The Origins of Classical Genetics|last=Carlson|first=Elof Axel|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor|year=2004|location=New York}}</ref> Most prominent of these previous approaches was the [[Biostatistics|biometric]] school of [[Karl Pearson]] and [[W. F. R. Weldon]], which was based heavily on statistical studies of phenotype variation. The strongest opposition to this school came from [[William Bateson]], who perhaps did the most in the early days of publicising the benefits of Mendel's theory (the word "[[genetics]]", and much of the discipline's other terminology, originated with Bateson). This debate between the biometricians and the Mendelians was extremely vigorous in the first two decades of the 20th century, with the biometricians claiming statistical and mathematical rigor,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Deichmann|first1=Ute|title=Early 20th-century research at the interfaces of genetics, development, and evolution: Reflections on progress and dead ends|journal=Developmental Biology|date=2011|volume=357|issue=1|pages=3–12|doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.02.020 |pmid=21392502|doi-access=free}}</ref> whereas the Mendelians claimed a better understanding of biology.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elston|first1=RC|last2=Thompson|first2=EA|author2-link= Elizabeth A.

Ultimately, the two approaches were combined, especially by work conducted by [[R. A. Fisher]] as early as 1918. The combination, in the 1930s and 1940s, of Mendelian genetics with Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]] resulted in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[evolutionary biology]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kutschera |first1=Ulrich|last2=Niklas|first2=KarlJ.|title=The modern theory of biological evolution: an expanded synthesis|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=2004|volume=91|issue=6|pages=255–76|doi=10.1007/s00114-004-0515-y|pmid=15241603|bibcode=2004NW.....91..255K|s2cid=10731711}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Brian Keith|last2=Hallgrímsson|first2=Benedikt|last3=Strickberger |first3=Monroe W.|title=Strickberger's evolution|date=2014|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|location=Burlington, Mass.|isbn=978-1-4496-1484-3|pages=10–11|edition=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkcvuVpzjYQC}}</ref>

In the [[Soviet Union]] and China, Mendelian genetics was rejected in favor of [[Lamarckism]], leading to imprisonment and even execution of Mendelian geneticists (see [[Lysenkoism]]).

After his death, Mendel's colleagues remembered that he bred mice, crossing varieties of different size, although Mendel has left no record of any such work.  A persistent myth has developed that Mendel turned his attention to plants only after Napp declared it unseemly for a celibate priest to closely observe rodent sex.  In a 2022 biography, Daniel Fairbanks argued that Napp could hardly have given such a pronouncement, as Napp personally oversaw sheep breeding on the monastery's extensive agricultural estate.<ref>{{cite book|first=Daniel&nbsp;J.|last=Fairbanks|author-link=Daniel Justin Fairbanks|at=Ch.&nbsp;4|title=Gregor Mendel|publisher=Promethean Books|location=Guilford, CT|year=2022|lccn=2021054684|isbn=9781633888395}}</ref>

== Mendelian paradox<!--'Mendelian paradox' redirects here--> ==
In 1936, [[Ronald Fisher]], a prominent statistician and population geneticist, reconstructed Mendel's experiments, analyzed results from the F<sub>2</sub> (second filial) generation, and found the ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes (e.g., yellow versus green peas; round versus wrinkled peas) to be implausibly and consistently too close to the expected ratio of 3 to 1.<ref name=fisher36>{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=R.A.|title=Has Mendel's work been rediscovered?|journal=Annals of Science|year=1936|volume=1|issue=2|pages=115–37|doi=10.1080/00033793600200111|url=https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/15123/1/144.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413101103/http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/15123/1/144.pdf |archive-date=2011-04-13 |url-status=live|hdl=2440/15123|hdl-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thompson| first1=EA| title=R.A.

Other scholars agree with Fisher that Mendel's various observations come uncomfortably close to Mendel's expectations. [[A. W. F. Edwards]],<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=A. W. F.|date=1986|title=More on the too-good-to-be-true paradox and Gregor Mendel|journal=Journal of Heredity|volume=77|issue=2|page=138 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a110192}}</ref> for instance, remarks: "One can applaud the lucky gambler; but when he is lucky again tomorrow, and the next day, and the following day, one is entitled to become a little suspicious". Three other lines of evidence likewise lend support to the assertion that Mendel's results are indeed too good to be true.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|date=1994|title=Psychological, Historical, and Ethical Reflections on the Mendelian Paradox|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=37|issue=2|pages=182–96|doi=10.1353/pbm.1994.0027|pmid=11644519|s2cid=33124822}}</ref>

Fisher's analysis gave rise to the '''Mendelian paradox'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->: Mendel's reported data are, statistically speaking, too good to be true, yet "everything we know about Mendel suggests that he was unlikely to engage in either deliberate fraud or in an unconscious adjustment of his observations".<ref name=":1" /> Several writers have attempted to resolve this paradox.

One attempted explanation invokes [[confirmation bias]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=Michael|title=Sins against science: Data fabrication and other forms of scientific misconduct may be more prevalent than you think|journal=Monitor on Psychology|year=2010|volume=41|issue=7|page=44|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/07-08/misconduct.aspx}}</ref> Fisher accused Mendel's experiments as "biased strongly in the direction of agreement with expectation{{nbsp}}[...] to give the theory the benefit of the doubt".<ref name="fisher36" /> In a 2004 article, J.W. Porteous concluded that Mendel's observations were indeed implausible.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Porteous|first1=JW|title=We still fail to account for Mendel's observations.|journal=Theoretical Biology & Medical Modelling|date=2004|volume=1|pages=4|pmid=15312231|pmc=516238|doi=10.1186/1742-4682-1-4 |doi-access=free }}</ref> An explanation for Mendel's results based on [[Tetrad (meiosis)|tetrad]] pollen has been proposed, but reproduction of the experiments showed no evidence that the tetrad-pollen model explains any of the bias.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fairbanks|first1=D. J.|last2=Schaalje|first2=G.

Another attempt<ref name=":1" /> to resolve the Mendelian paradox notes that a conflict may sometimes arise between the moral imperative of a bias-free recounting of one's factual observations and the even more important imperative of advancing scientific knowledge. Mendel might have felt compelled "to simplify his data to meet real, or feared editorial objections."<ref name=":3" /> Such an action could be justified on moral grounds (and hence provide a resolution to the Mendelian paradox) since the alternative—refusing to comply—might have hindered the growth of scientific knowledge. Similarly, like so many other obscure innovators of science,<ref name=":2" /> Mendel, a little-known innovator of working-class background, had to "break through the cognitive paradigms and social prejudices" of his audience.<ref name=":3" /> If such a breakthrough "could be best achieved by deliberately omitting some observations from his report and adjusting others to make them more palatable to his audience, such actions could be justified on moral grounds."<ref name=":1" />

[[Dan Hartl|Daniel L. Hartl]] and [[Daniel J. Fairbanks]] reject outright Fisher's statistical argument, suggesting that Fisher incorrectly interpreted Mendel's experiments. They find it likely that Mendel scored more than ten progeny and that the results matched the expectation. They conclude: "Fisher's allegation of deliberate falsification can finally be put to rest, because on closer analysis it has proved to be unsupported by convincing evidence".<ref name="hartl">{{cite journal |last= Hartl|first=Daniel L. |author2=Fairbanks, Daniel J. |year= 2007|title=Mud sticks: On the alleged falsification of Mendel's Data |journal=Genetics |volume=175 |issue= 3 |pages=975–79 |doi=10.1093/genetics/175.3.975 |pmid= 17384156 |pmc= 1840063}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Novitski|first=Charles E.|year=2004|title=On Fisher's criticism of Mendel's results with the garden pea|url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/166/3/1133|journal=Genetics|volume=166|issue=3|pages=1133–36|doi=10.1534/genetics.166.3.1133|pmc=1470775|pmid=15082533|access-date=20 March 2010|quote=In conclusion, Fisher's criticism of Mendel's data—that Mendel was obtaining data too close to false expectations in the two sets of experiments involving the determination of segregation ratios—is undoubtedly unfounded.}}</ref> In 2008 Hartl and Fairbanks (with Allan Franklin and AWF Edwards) wrote a comprehensive book in which they concluded that there were no reasons to assert Mendel fabricated his results, nor that Fisher deliberately tried to diminish Mendel's legacy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Franklin|first1=Allan|last2=Edwards|first2=AWF|last3=Fairbanks|first3=Daniel J|last4=Hartl |first4=Daniel L|title=Ending the Mendel-Fisher controversy|year=2008|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh, PA|isbn=978-0-8229-4319-8|page=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C4m6NlmGhjgC}}</ref> Reassessment of Fisher's statistical analysis, according to these authors, also disproves the notion of confirmation bias in Mendel's results.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Monaghan|first1=F|last2=Corcos|first2=A|title=Chi-square and Mendel's experiments: where's the bias?|journal=The Journal of Heredity|date=1985|volume=76|issue=4|pages=307–09|pmid=4031468|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a110099}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Novitski|first1=C.
