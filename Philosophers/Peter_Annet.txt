'''Peter Annet''' (1693{{snd}}18 January 1769) was an [[English people|English]] [[Deism|deist]] and early [[Freethought|freethinker]].

==Early life and work==
Annet is said to have been born at [[Liverpool]]. A schoolmaster by profession, he became prominent owing to his attacks on orthodox theologians, as well as for his membership of a semi-theological debating society, the [[Robin Hood Society]], which met at the Robin Hood and Little John at [[Butcher Row]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Annet was very hostile to the clergy and to [[scripture]], being a thoroughgoing deist. He distinguished himself by being extremely critical of the character and reputation of [[King David]] and the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]]. In 1739 he wrote and published a pamphlet, ''Judging for Ourselves, or Freethinking the Great Duty of Religion,'' a strong criticism of [[Christianity]]. For writing this and similar pamphlets, he lost his teaching position.

A work attributed to him, called ''A History of the Man after God's own Heart'' (1761), intended to show that King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] was insulted by a current comparison with King David. The book is said to have inspired [[Voltaire]]'s ''Saul''. It is also attributed to one John Noorthouck (Noorthook).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1763 he was condemned for blasphemous [[libel]] in his paper called the ''Free Inquirer'', of which only nine numbers were published. After his release he kept a small school in [[Lambeth]], one of his pupils being the politician [[James Stephen (British politician)|James Stephen]] (1758â€“1832), who became master in [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Pillory and death==
At age 68, Annet was sentenced to the [[pillory]] and a year's hard labour. He died on 18 January 1769.{{sfn|Stephen|1885}}

==Position==
When the Christian [[apologist]]s replaced the [[argument from miracles]] with the [[Argument from religious experience|argument from personal witness]] and the credibility of [[Bible|Biblical]] evidence, Annet, in his ''Resurrection of Jesus'' (1744), assailed the validity of such evidence, and first advanced the hypothesis of the illusory death of [[Jesus]], suggesting also that possibly [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] should be regarded as the founder of a new religion. 
In ''Supernaturals Examined'' (1747) Annet roundly denies the possibility of miracles.

Annet stands between the earlier philosophic deists and the later propagandists of [[Thomas Paine]]'s school, and seems to have been the first [[freethought]] lecturer ([[J. M. Robertson]]); his essays, ''A Collection of the Tracts of a certain Free Enquirer'', are forcible but lack refinement. He invented a system of shorthand (2nd ed., with a copy of verses by [[Joseph Priestley]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{sfn|Stephen|1885}}
