'''Sir Anthony John Patrick Kenny''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 16 March 1931) is a British [[philosopher]] whose interests lie in the [[philosophy of mind]], [[ancient philosophy|ancient]] and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophy, the [[philosophy of religion]], and the philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] of whose [[literary estate]] he is an executor. With [[Peter Geach]], he has made a significant contribution to [[analytical Thomism]], a movement whose aim is to present the thought of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the style of [[analytic philosophy]]. He is a former president of the [[British Academy]] and the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]]. He has two sons, Charles James Kenny and Robert Alexander Kenny. He also has  four grandchildren.

==Education and early career==
Kenny was born in Liverpool on 16 March 1931, the son of John and Margaret (Jones) Kenny.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |title=Kenny, Sir Anthony (John Patrick), (born 16 March 1931), Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Oxford University, 1984–2001 (Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Development, 1999–2001); Warden, Rhodes House, 1989–99; Professorial Fellow, St John's College, Oxford, 1989–99, now Emeritus Fellow; Master of Balliol College, Oxford, 1978–89 |url=https://www.ukwhoswho.com/display/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-22897 |url-access=subscription |access-date=2023-12-13 |website=WHO'S WHO & WHO WAS WHO |date=2007 |language=en |doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u22897 |quote=Born Liverpool 16 March 1931; s of John Kenny and Margaret Jones; m 1966, Nancy Caroline, d of Henry T.

Kenny initially trained as a [[Roman Catholic priest]] at the [[Venerable English College]], [[Rome]], where he received a degree of [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology]] (STL) degree. He was ordained in 1955 and served as a [[curate]] in [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool|Liverpool]] (1959–63).

Having received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] from the [[University of Oxford]] ([[St Benet's Hall, Oxford|St Benet's Hall]]) in 1961, he also worked as an assistant lecturer at the [[University of Liverpool]] (1961–63). However, he questioned the validity of [[Roman Catholic doctrine]] and has been an [[agnostic]] since the late 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2018/14-december/features/interviews/interview-anthony-kenny-philosopher|title=Interview: Anthony Kenny, philosopher|website=www.churchtimes.co.uk|access-date=2019-03-16|quote=I’m agnostic about the existence of God.

He was not, however, released from his vow of celibacy, and so was automatically excommunicated when he married in 1965.}}</ref>

==Academic career==
During 1963–64, Kenny was a lecturer in philosophy at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter]] and [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity]] Colleges, Oxford, and he served as University Lecturer 1965–78. From 1964 until 1978, he was a Fellow of [[Balliol College, Oxford]] and Senior Tutor during the periods 1971–72 and 1976–78.

He was [[Pro-Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Oxford]] from 1984 to 2001 (Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Development, 1999–2001). He retired in 2001.

Within the university, Kenny was Wilde Lecturer in Natural and Comparative Religion (1969–72), Speaker's Lecturer in Biblical Studies (1980–83), a member of the Hebdomadal Council (1981–93), Vice-chairman of the Libraries Board (1985–88), Curator of the [[Bodleian Library]] (1985–88) and a Delegate, and member of the Finance Committee, of [[Oxford University Press]] (1986–93).

He was a member of the Board of the [[British Library]] 1991-96 and Chairman 1993–96, and has served as Chairman of the Society for Protection of Science and Learning (1989–93), of the British National Corpus Advisory Board (1990–95), of the British Irish Association (1990–94), and of the Board of the [[Warburg Institute]] (1996–2000).

==Philosophical work==
Although deeply interested in traditional Catholic teaching and continuing to take limited participation in the [[Catholic Mass]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dowling |first=W. C. |author-link=William C. Dowling |date=2003 |title=Meaningless grades and a new dishonesty. |url=https://english.rutgers.edu/images/documents/faculty/dowling-ja-2003.pdf |journal=[[Academic Questions]] |volume=76 |issue=4 |page=61 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930105750/https://english.rutgers.edu/images/documents/faculty/dowling-ja-2003.pdf |archive-date=30 September 2015 |quote=I was reading Anthony Kenny’s ''A Life in Oxford''. . . . After he has applied for and achieved laicization, married, and taken up a position at Oxford, Kenny—by now an agnostic—continues to attend Catholic Mass. But he does so as a non-Catholic, always careful to limit his participation in the liturgy to those portions that do not imply either religious belief or membership in the Church. His reasoning [being] . . .  'to recite the Creed or receive Communion would be, in my view, not only a sacrifice of integrity on the part of the unbeliever but also an insult to the seriousness with which these actions are undertaken by believers.'}}</ref> Kenny now explicitly defines himself as an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], explaining in the third chapter of his ''What I Believe'' (2006) both why he is not a theist and why he is not an atheist:<blockquote>"Many different definitions may be offered of the word 'God'. Given this fact, atheism makes a much stronger claim than theism does. The atheist says that no matter what definition you choose, 'God exists' is always false. The theist only claims that there is some definition which will make 'God exists' true. In my view, neither the stronger nor the weaker claim has been convincingly established."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Kenny |first=Anthony |url= |title=What I Believe |date=2006-07-03 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=978-0-8264-8971-5 |page=21 |language=en |chapter=Why I am Not an Atheist |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQnZcFiCz8QC&pg=PA21 |url-access=}}</ref></blockquote>He goes on: "the true default position is neither theism nor atheism, but agnosticism ... a claim to knowledge needs to be substantiated; ignorance need only be confessed."<ref name=":0" />

That (as Kenny puts it) "there is no such being as the God of traditional natural theology: the concept of God propounded by scholastic theologians and rationalistic philosophers is an incoherent one"<ref name=":2" /> is, according to [[William Hasker]],  the 'most important conclusion' of Kenny's 'essay in natural theology' ''The God of the Philosophers'' (1979).<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last=Hasker |first=William |author-link=William Hasker |date=1981 |title=Review of The God of the Philosophers |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2184617 |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=621–624 |doi=10.2307/2184617 |jstor=2184617 |issn=0031-8108}}</ref> Hasker notes, however, that (in the book's final chapter) Kenny "considers seriously the possible existence of a God who, while differing somewhat in his attributes from the God of traditional natural theology, could still be identified with the saving God of theistic faith."<ref name=":3" />

Hasker further notes that Kenny "concludes by suggesting that one who is in doubt about God may rationally pray for enlightenment about his existence and nature:"<ref name=":3" /> As Kenny asserts: "It surely is no more unreasonable than the act of a man adrift in the ocean, trapped in a cave, or stranded on a mountainside, who cries for help though he may never be heard or fires a signal which may never be seen."<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Kenny |first=Anthony |url=http://archive.org/details/godofphilosopher0000kenn |title=The God of the philosophers |date=1979 |publisher=Oxford : Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press |others=Internet Archive |isbn=978-0-19-824594-0 |pages=121, 179 |url-access=registration}}</ref> And if there is such a God, then such prayer "cannot be less pleasing to him than the attitude of a man who takes no interest in a question so important, or in a question so difficult would not welcome assistance beyond human powers.".<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" />

Kenny has written extensively on [[Thomas Aquinas]] and modern [[Thomism]]. In ''The Five Ways'' (1969),<ref>{{Cite book |last=Anthony Kenny |url=http://archive.org/details/anthony-kenny-studies-in-5-ways-of-aquinas |title=Anthony Kenny Studies In 5 Ways Of Aquinas |date=2018 |url-access=registration |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> he deals with St. Thomas' five proofs of God. In it, he argues that none of the proofs Thomas sets out is wholly valid, and instead sets out to show the flaws in the five ways.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=J.

Kenny candidly describes the predicament of the beginning of the universe, which both atheists and agnostics face, writing, "According to the Big Bang Theory, the whole matter of the universe began at a particular time in the remote past. A proponent of such a theory, at least if he is an atheist, must believe that the matter of the universe came from nothing and by nothing."<ref>Anthony Kenny, ''[[iarchive:anthony-kenny-studies-in-5-ways-of-aquinas|The Five Ways: St. Thomas Aquinas' Proofs of God's Existence]]'' (New York: Schocken, 1969), [[iarchive:anthony-kenny-studies-in-5-ways-of-aquinas/page/66/mode/1up|p. 66]]</ref>

In ''What Is Faith?'' (1992), Kenny addresses "the question of whether belief in God, and faith in a divine world, is a reasonable or rational state of mind."<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Kenny |first=Anthony |url=http://archive.org/details/whatisfaithessay0000kenn |title=What is faith? : essays in the philosophy of religion |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press |others=Internet Archive |isbn=978-0-19-283067-8 |pages=3, 9–10 |url-access=registration}}</ref> He criticises the idea, "common to theists like [[Aquinas]] and [[Descartes]] and to an atheist like [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]," that "Rational belief [is] either self-evident or based directly or indirectly on what is evident", which he terms "[[foundationalism]]" following [[Alvin Plantinga|Plantinga]],<ref name=":1" /> arguing that foundationalism is a [[self-refuting idea]].

During the 2000s Kenny wrote a history of [[Western philosophy]], released in four parts from 2004 to 2007; the four books were released together as ''[[A New History of Western Philosophy]]'' in 2010.<ref>Kenny, Anthony. ''A New History of Western Philosophy'', p xiv.</ref>

In ''Brief Encounters'' (2018) Kenny says [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] was "corrupted by being famous. He gave up philosophy for rhetoric, and rhetoric of a particularly childish kind".<ref name="brief">{{cite book |last1=Kenny |first1=Anthony |title=Brief Encounters: Notes from a Philosopher's Diary |date=2018 |publisher=SPCK |isbn=978-0281079193 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PTVxDwAAQBAJ}}</ref> Writing of [[Richard Dawkins]], he suggests that "moving from ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'' to ''[[The God Delusion]]'' is like moving from the ''[[Financial Times]]'' to ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''."  He commends [[Denis Noble]]'s principle of 'Biological Relativity' which states (according to Kenny) that "in biology there is no privileged level of causation: living organisms and multilevel open systems in which the behaviour at any level depends on higher and lower levels".<ref name="brief" />

==Honours and awards==
Kenny was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] in 1992 and has been an Honorary Bencher of [[Lincoln's Inn]] since 1999.

In October 2006, Kenny was awarded the American Catholic Philosophical Association's Aquinas Medal for his significant contributions to philosophy.
