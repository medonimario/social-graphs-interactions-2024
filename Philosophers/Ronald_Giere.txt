Giere, un maestro de la filosofía de la ciencia|publisher=El País|date=31 May 2020|last=Estany|first=Anna|language=es|access-date=8 June 2020}}</ref> was an American [[Philosophy of Science|philosopher of science]] who was an emeritus professor of philosophy at the [[University of Minnesota]]. He was a Fellow of The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]], a long-time member of the editorial board of the journal ''Philosophy of Science'', and a past president of the [[Philosophy of Science Association]]. His research focused on agent-based accounts of models and scientific representation, and on connections between naturalism and secularism.

==Work==
In his book ''Scientific Perspectivism'' he developed a version of perspectival realism in which he argued that scientific descriptions are somewhat like colours, in that they capture only selected aspects of reality, and those aspects are not bits of the world seen as they are in themselves, but bits of the world seen from a distinctive human perspective. In addition to the color example, Giere articulates his perspectivism by appeal to maps and to his own earlier and influential work on scientific models. Maps represent the world, but the representations they provide are conventional, affected by interest, and never fully accurate or complete. Similarly, scientific models are idealized structures that represent the world from particular and limited points of view. According to Giere, what goes for colors, maps, and models goes generally: science is perspectival through and through.<ref>Review of ''Scientific Perspectivism'' in [[Science (journal)|Science]] 11 May 2007: Vol. '''316'''. no. 5826, p. 834 {{doi|10.1126/science.1141366}}</ref>
