'''Gabriel Honoré Marcel'''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|m|ɑːr|ˈ|s|ɛ|l}} {{respell|mar|SEL}}; French: {{IPA|fr|ɡabʁijɛl ɔnɔʁe maʁsɛl|}}.}} (7 December 1889 – 8 October 1973) was a [[French philosopher]], [[playwright]], [[music critic]] and leading [[Christian existentialism|Christian existentialist]]. The author of over a dozen books and at least thirty plays, Marcel's work focused on the modern individual's struggle in a technologically dehumanizing society. Though often regarded as the first French existentialist, he dissociated himself from figures such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], preferring the term ''philosophy of existence'' or ''neo-Socrateanism'' to define his own thought. ''[[The Mystery of Being]]'' is a well-known two-volume work authored by Marcel.

==Early life and education==
Marcel was born on 7 December 1889 in [[Paris]], France. His mother Laure Meyer, who was [[Jewish]], died when he was young and he was brought up by his aunt and father, [[Henry Marcel]].  When he was eight he moved for a year where his father was [[envoy (title)|minister plenipotentiary]].<ref name="citadel" />

Marcel completed his DES thesis{{efn|The title of his 1910 thesis was ''Coleridge et Schelling'' (''[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]''). It was published in 1971 (see Jeanne Parain-Vial, ''Gabriel Marcel: un veilleur et un éveilleur'', L'Âge d'Homme, 1989, p. 12).}} (''{{Interlanguage link|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) and obtained the ''[[agrégation]]'' in philosophy from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1910, at the unusually young age of 20.  During the First World War he worked as head of the Information Service, organized by the [[Red Cross]] to convey news of injured soldiers to their families.<ref name="citadel" /> He taught in secondary schools, was a drama critic for various literary journals, and worked as an editor for [[Plon (publisher)|Plon]], the major French Catholic publisher.<ref name="stanford">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marcel/ Gabriel (-Honoré) Marcel], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'</ref>

Marcel was the son of an [[agnostic]],<ref name="citadel">{{cite book | title=The Philosophy of Existentialism | publisher=Citadel Press | author=Marcel, Gabriel | year=1947 | location=Paris | isbn=0-8065-0901-5 | others=[[Manya Harari]] | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/philosophyofexis0000marc }}</ref> and was himself not a member of any organized religion until his conversion to [[Catholicism]] in 1929. Marcel was opposed to [[anti-Semitism]] and supported reaching out to non-Catholics.

He died 8 October 1973 in Paris.

==Existential themes==
He is often classified as one of the earliest [[existentialism|existentialists]], although he dreaded being placed in the same category as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]; Marcel came to prefer the label ''neo-[[Socrates|Socratic]]'' (possibly because of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], the father of [[Christian existentialism]], who was a neo-Socratic thinker himself). While Marcel recognized that human interaction often involved objective characterisation of "the other", he still asserted the possibility of "communion"&nbsp;– a state where both individuals can perceive each other's subjectivity.

In ''The Existential Background of Human Dignity'', Marcel refers to a play he had written in 1913 entitled ''Le Palais de Sable'', in order to provide an example of a person who was unable to treat others as subjects.

<blockquote>Roger Moirans, the central character of the play, is a politician, a conservative who is dedicated to defending the rights of Catholicism against free thought. He has set himself up as the champion of traditional monarchy and has just achieved a great success in the city council where he has attacked the secularism of public schools. It is natural enough that he should be opposed to the divorce of his daughter Therese, who wants to leave her unfaithful husband and start her life afresh. In this instance he proves himself virtually heartless; all his tenderness goes out to his second daughter, Clarisse, whom he takes to be spiritually very much like himself. But now Clarisse tells him that she has decided to take the veil and become a Carmelite. Moirans is horrified by the idea that this creature, so lovely, intelligent, and full of life, might go and bury herself in a convent and he decides to do his utmost to make her give up her intention... Clarisse is deeply shocked; her father now appears to her as an impostor, virtually as a deliberate fraud...<ref>''The Existential Background of Human Dignity'', pp. 31–32.</ref></blockquote>

In this case, Moirans is unable to treat either of his daughters as a subject, instead rejecting both because each does not conform to her objectified image in his mind. Marcel notes that such objectification "does no less than denude its object of the one thing which he has which is of value, and so it degrades him effectively."<ref>''Homo Viator'', p. 23.</ref>

Another related major thread in Marcel was the struggle to protect one's subjectivity from annihilation by modern [[materialism]] and a [[technology|technologically]] driven society. Marcel argued that scientific egoism replaces the "mystery" of being with a false scenario of human life composed of technical "problems" and "solutions". For Marcel, the human subject cannot exist in the technological world, instead being replaced by a human object. As he points out in ''Man Against Mass Society'' and other works, technology has a privileged authority with which it persuades the subject to accept his place as "he" in the internal dialogue of science; and as a result, man is convinced by science to rejoice in his own annihilation.<ref>{{Cite book

==Influence==
[[File:Plaque Gabriel Marcel, 21 rue de Tournon, Paris 6.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque at the home where Marcel resided from 1933 until his death.]]
For many years, Marcel hosted a weekly philosophy discussion group through which he met and influenced important younger French philosophers like [[Jean Wahl]], [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Marcel was puzzled and disappointed that his reputation was almost entirely based on his philosophical treatises and not on his plays, which he wrote in the hope of appealing to a wider lay audience. He also influenced [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] and [[Thomism|Thomistic]] philosopher Karol Wojtyla (later [[Pope John Paul II]]), who drew on Marcel's distinction between "being" and "having" in his critique of technological change.<ref>{{Citation |last=Jeffreys |first=Derek S. |title=The Legacy of John Paul II: An Evangelical Assessment |pages=37–56 |year=2007 |editor-last=Perry |editor-first=Tim |contribution='A Deep Amazement at Man's Worth and Dignity': Technology and the Person in ''Redemptor hominis'' |publisher=[[InterVarsity Press]]}}.</ref>
