'''Maurice Blondel''' ({{IPA|fr|blɔ̃dɛl|lang}}; 2 November 1861 – 4 June 1949) was a French philosopher, whose most influential works, notably ''L'Action'', aimed at establishing the correct relationship between autonomous philosophical reasoning and Christian belief.

==Biography==
Blondel was born in [[Dijon]] in 1861. He came from a family who were traditionally connected to the legal profession, but chose early in life to follow a career in philosophy. In 1881, he gained admission to the [[École Normale Supérieure]] of Paris. In 1893 he finished his thesis "L'Action" (Action), 'an essay on a critique of life and a science of practice'. He was at this time refused a teaching post (as would have been his due) because his philosophical conclusions were deemed to be too Christian and, therefore, "compromising" of philosophical reason. In 1895, however, with the help of his former teacher [[Émile Boutroux]], he became a ''Maître de Conférences'' at [[Lille]], then shortly after at [[Aix-en-Provence]], where he became a professor in 1897. He would remain in Aix-en-Provence for the rest of his career.<ref>Michael A Conway, 'Maurice Blondel and ''Ressourcement'' ', in Gabriel Flynn and Paul D. Murray, ''Ressourcement'' (Oxford: OUP, 2012), p70.</ref>

In ''L'Action'', Blondel developed a "[[philosophy of action]]" in which he applies the method of phenomenology.  This leads him to the first order issue of "action", critiquing the Enlightenment enshrinement of thought, which he subsumes under the category of action.  This leads him to discover the distinction between the willing will and the willed will.  This distinction shows a real insufficiency between the two elements of the will.  The problem of connaturality – that man cannot desire something which cannot be fulfilled – leads to investigating how the willing will can be fulfilled in the willed will.  This insufficiency leads him to eventually hypothesize the supernatural as the only real possibility.  He insists that this is as far as a philosopher can go, that the supernatural is the real end of man, and that the content of the supernatural is left to the realm of theology.

His subsequent works, the ''Letter on Apologetics'' and ''History and Dogma'', were also connected to the philosophical problem of religion. They unleashed an enormous controversy at the time of publication. [[Pope Pius X]]'s 1907 encyclical ''[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]'' targeted the [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|Modernist]] threat to Catholic thought, and Blondel's thought remained associated (perhaps tenuously) with the Modernists. Blondel, however, was never the target of ''Pascendi'' and he received letters, through the Archbishop of Aix, from numerous Popes affirming he was not under suspicion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Portier|first=William|date=Spring 2011|title=Twentieth-Century Catholic Theology and the Triumph of Maurice Blondel|url=https://www.communio-icr.com/files/Portier_Spring_2011.pdf|journal=Communio}}</ref> He did, however, have great influence on later Catholic thought, especially through ''ressourcement'' theologians such as [[Henri de Lubac]].<ref>Michael A Conway, 'Maurice Blondel and ''Ressourcement'' ', in Gabriel Flynn and Paul D. Murray, ''Ressourcement'' (Oxford: OUP, 2012), p70.</ref>

His wife died in 1919 and in 1927 he retired for health reasons. Between 1934 and 1937 he published a trilogy dedicated to thought, being and action. In 1935, he published an essay of concrete and integrale [[ontology]] "L'être et les êtres" (''The Being and the Beings'') and in 1946 he published "L'esprit chrétien" (''The Christian Spirit'').

Blondel died in Aix-en-Provence in 1949. He was the younger brother of historian [[Georges Blondel]] and a first cousin of physicist [[André Blondel]].
