As a teen, West marched in [[civil rights]] demonstrations and organized protests demanding Black studies courses at his high school, where he was the student body president. He later wrote that, in his youth, he admired "the sincere Black militancy of [[Malcolm X]], the defiant rage of the [[Black Panther Party]], and the livid [[Black theology]] of [[James Cone]]".<ref>{{cite book |url= https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/221862.Cornel_West_Reader |title= The Cornel West Reader |isbn= 978-0-465-09110-2 |author1= West, Cornel |date= August 13, 2000 |publisher= Basic Books |access-date= May 30, 2020 |archive-date= July 29, 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200729175750/https://books.google.com/books?id=Kk6ovUWs02AC&pg=PA3 |url-status= live }}</ref>

In 1970, after graduation from high school, he enrolled at [[Harvard College]] and took classes taught by the philosophers [[Robert Nozick]] and [[Stanley Cavell]].

== Career ==

=== Academic appointments ===

In his late 20s, he returned to Harvard as a [[W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois]] [[Fellow]] before becoming an assistant professor at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York]]. In 1984, he went to [[Yale Divinity School]] in what eventually became a joint appointment in [[American studies]]. While at Yale, he participated in campus protests for a clerical labor union and [[divestment]] from [[apartheid]] South Africa. One of the protests resulted in his being arrested and jailed. As punishment, the university administration canceled his leave for the spring term in 1987, leading him to commute from Yale in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], where he was teaching two classes, across the Atlantic Ocean to the [[University of Paris in Saint-Denis]].<ref name="blackbio"/><ref>{{Cite web |last=Adamson |first=Peter |date=2024-01-28 |title=140.

He then returned to Union Theological Seminary <!-- restore when you can find a source: and taught at [[Haverford College]] in Pennsylvania --> for one year before going to Princeton to become a professor of religion and director of the program in [[African American studies|African American Studies]] from 1988 to 1994.<ref name=blackbio/> After Princeton, he accepted an appointment as professor of African American studies at Harvard University, with a joint appointment at the [[Harvard Divinity School]].<ref name=Aaseng>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Aaseng |editor-first=Nathan |encyclopedia=African-American Religious Leaders |title=Cornel West |year=2003 |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-4878-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/africanamericanr00aase_0/page/237 237] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/africanamericanr00aase_0/page/237 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2016}}</ref> West taught one of the university's most popular courses, an introductory class on African American studies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/2002/08/16/cornel-wests-difficult-road-to-princeton/ |title=Cornel West's difficult road to Princeton |last=Duke |first=Lynn |date=August 16, 2002 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=October 22, 2011 |archive-date=August 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808174111/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-08-16/features/0208160010_1_cornel-west-president-of-harvard-university-prostate-surgery |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1998, he was appointed the first [[Alphonse Fletcher]] [[Endowed professor|University Professor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aaas.fas.harvard.edu/about/moments |title=Other Key Moments in the Department |publisher=Department of African and African American Studies, Harvard University |access-date=October 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006185200/http://aaas.fas.harvard.edu/about/moments |archive-date=October 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> West used this new position to teach in not only African American studies, but also courses in divinity, religion, and philosophy.<ref name=Aaseng/> West was also inducted into [[Omicron Delta Kappa]] in 1998 at [[SUNY Plattsburgh]].

==== Dispute with Lawrence Summers ====
In 2000, economist and former U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Lawrence Summers]] became president of Harvard. Soon after, Summers held a private meeting with West, in which he reportedly rebuked West for missing too many classes, contributing to [[grade inflation]], neglecting serious scholarship, and spending too much time on his financially profitable projects.<ref>{{cite news |date=January 10, 2002 |title=Who is Cornel West? |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/fyi/teachers.ednews/01/10/west.harvard.ap/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226113730/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/fyi/teachers.ednews/01/10/west.harvard.ap/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=December 26, 2007 |access-date=January 21, 2008 |publisher=[[CNN|Cable News Network]] |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Summers reportedly suggested that West produce an academic book befitting his professorial position, as his recent output had consisted primarily of co-written and edited volumes. According to some reports, Summers also objected to West's production of a CD, the critically panned ''Sketches of My Culture'', and to his political campaigning, including spending an alleged three weeks to promote [[Bill Bradley]]'s [[Bill Bradley 2000 presidential campaign|2000 presidential campaign]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Steinberg |first=Jacques |author-link=Jacques Steinberg |date=November 29, 2001 |title=At Odds With Harvard President, Black-Studies Stars Eye Princeton |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E4D71F31F93AA15751C1A9679C8B63 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220110194214/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/29/us/at-odds-with-harvard-president-black-studies-stars-eye-princeton.html |archive-date=January 10, 2022 |access-date=January 21, 2008 |work=The New York Times |location=New York City}}</ref> West contended he had missed only one class during his time at Harvard "in order to give a keynote address at a Harvard-sponsored conference on AIDS". Summers also allegedly suggested that since West held the rank of [[Harvard University Professor]] and thus reported directly to the president, he should meet with Summers regularly to discuss the progress of his academic production.<ref name="indignant">{{cite news |last=Belluck |first=Pam |author2=Jacques Steinberg |date=April 16, 2002 |title=Defector Indignant at President of Harvard |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE6DB113CF935A25757C0A9649C8B63 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220110194213/https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/16/us/defector-indignant-at-president-of-harvard.html |archive-date=January 10, 2022 |access-date=January 21, 2008 |work=The New York Times |location=New York City}}</ref>

Summers refused to comment on the details of his conversation with West, except to state that he hoped that West would remain at Harvard. Soon after, West was hospitalized for [[prostate cancer]]. West noted that Summers failed to send him get-well wishes until weeks after his surgery, whereas newly installed Princeton president [[Shirley Tilghman]] had contacted him frequently before and after his treatment.<ref name="indignant" /> In 2002, West left Harvard University to return to Princeton. West criticized Summers in public interviews, calling him "the [[Ariel Sharon]] of higher education" on the NPR program ''[[The Tavis Smiley Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web |date=January 7, 2002 |title=Cornel West Outlines "Pull toward Princeton" and "Push from Harvard" in Exclusive Interview with NPR's Tavis Smiley |url=https://www.npr.org/about/press/020415.cwest.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125224443/http://www.npr.org/about/press/020415.cwest.html |archive-date=January 25, 2011 |access-date=March 7, 2011 |publisher=Npr.org}}</ref> In response to these remarks, five Princeton faculty members, led by professor of molecular biology [[Jacques Robert Fresco]], said they looked with "strong disfavor upon his characterization" of Summers and that "such an analogy carries innuendoes and implications&nbsp;... that many on the Princeton faculty find highly inappropriate, indeed repugnant and intolerable".<ref>{{cite news |author=Jacques R.

[[File:Cornel West - What It Means to Be Human.webm|thumb|West discussing race and human nature in 2019]]
West has called the U.S. a "racist patriarchal" nation where [[white supremacy]] continues to define everyday life. "White America", he writes, "has been historically weak-willed in ensuring racial justice and has continued to resist fully accepting the humanity of Blacks." He goes on to say this has created many "degraded and oppressed people hungry for identity, meaning, and self-worth." West attributes most of the Black community's problems to "existential angst derive[d] from the lived experience of [[ontological]] wounds and emotional scars inflicted by white supremacist beliefs and images permeating U.S. society and culture."<ref>Cornel West, ''Race Matters'', p. 27, 2001 edition, {{ISBN|978-0-8070-0972-7}}.</ref>{{Secondary source needed|date=August 2024}}

In West's view, the [[September 11 attacks]] "gave white Americans a glimpse of what it means to be a Black person in the United States", feeling "unsafe, unprotected, subject to random violence, and hatred for who they are".<ref name="democracy matters">Cornel West, ''Democracy Matters,'' p. 20, 2004, {{ISBN|0-14-303583-5}}.</ref>{{Secondary source needed|date=August 2024}} "The ugly terrorist attacks on innocent civilians on 9/11", he said, "plunged the whole country into the blues."<ref name="democracy matters"/>{{Secondary source needed|date=August 2024}}

Viewing capitalism as the root cause of these alleged American lusts, West warns, "[[market fundamentalism|Free-market fundamentalism]] trivializes the concern for public interest.

In 2000, West worked as a senior advisor to [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] presidential candidate Bill Bradley. When Bradley lost in the [[2000 Democratic Party presidential primaries|primaries]], West became a prominent and active supporter of [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]], speaking at several Nader rallies. Some Greens sought to [[Draft (politics)|draft]] West to run as a presidential candidate in 2004. West declined, citing his active participation in the Al Sharpton campaign. West, along with other prominent [[Ralph Nader 2000 presidential campaign|Nader 2000]] supporters, signed the "Vote to Stop Bush" statement urging progressive voters in swing states to vote for [[John Kerry]], despite strong disagreements with many of Kerry's policies.<ref>"Senators Hillary Clinton and John Kerry are exemplary paternalistic nihilists...

In 2011, West participated in a "Poverty Tour" with [[Tavis Smiley]], his co-host on the [[Public Radio International]] program ''Smiley & West''. The tour became a two-part special on their radio program, as well as a five-night special on the PBS television program ''Tavis Smiley''. They recounted their experience on the tour in their 2012 bestselling book ''The Rich and the Rest of Us''. The stated aim of the tour was to highlight the plight of the [[poverty in the United States|impoverished population of the United States]] prior to the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]], whose candidates, West and Smiley stated, had ignored the plight of the poor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/8/9/cornel_west_tavis_smiley_on_obama|title=Cornel West & Tavis Smiley on Obama: 'Many of Us Are Exploring Other Possibilities in Coming Election'|website=Democracy Now!|date=August 9, 2011|access-date=April 21, 2012|archive-date=April 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417030551/http://www.democracynow.org/2011/8/9/cornel_west_tavis_smiley_on_obama|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Better source needed|reason=The current source is insufficiently reliable ([[WP:NOTRS]]).|date=August 2024}}[[File:Cornel West Introduces Bernie Sanders in South Carolina.webm|thumb|West introduces [[Bernie Sanders]] at a September 2015 [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|campaign]] rally in South Carolina]]

In 2014, West gave an interview criticizing Obama, calling him a "counterfeit" who posed as a progressive. West defined Obama's presidency as "a Wall Street presidency, a drone presidency, a national security presidency".<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|title=Cornel West: "He posed as a progressive and turned out to be counterfeit.

=== Support for Bernie Sanders ===
In 2015, West expressed his support for Democratic contender [[Bernie Sanders]] during an interview on ''[[CNN Tonight]]''. West argued that the Sanders plans to redistribute wealth from Wall Street elites to the poorest members of society would be beneficial for the African-American community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ringoffireradio.com/2015/08/civil-rights-activist-cornel-west-throws-support-behind-bernie-sanders/|title=Civil Rights Activist Cornel West Throws Support Behind Bernie Sanders|website=Ring of Fire|date=August 19, 2015|access-date=August 19, 2015|archive-date=August 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820020115/http://ringoffireradio.com/2015/08/civil-rights-activist-cornel-west-throws-support-behind-bernie-sanders/|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Better source needed|reason=The current source is insufficiently reliable ([[WP:NOTRS]]).|date=August 2024}} On August 24, 2015, West tweeted, "I endorse Brother @BernieSanders because he is a long-distance runner with integrity in the struggle for justice for over 50 years."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/25/bernie-sanders-gets-stamp-of-approval-from-cornel-west/|title=Bernie Sanders Gets Stamp of Approval From Cornel West|newspaper=The New York Times|first=Alan|last=Rappeport|date=August 25, 2015|access-date=February 15, 2017|archive-date=May 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514001821/http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/25/bernie-sanders-gets-stamp-of-approval-from-cornel-west/?_r=0|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following the victory of [[Donald Trump]], West contended in an op-ed for ''[[The Guardian]]'' that white working- and middle-class voters "rejected the economic neglect of neoliberal policies and the self-righteous arrogance of elites", yet "supported a candidate who appeared to blame their social misery on minorities, and who alienated Mexican immigrants, Muslims, Black people, Jews, gay people, women, and China in the process."<ref>West, Cornel (November 17, 2016), [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/17/american-neoliberalism-cornel-west-2016-election "Goodbye, American neoliberalism.
