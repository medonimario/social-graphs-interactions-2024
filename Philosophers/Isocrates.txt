'''Isocrates''' ({{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|s|ɒ|k|r|ə|t|iː|z}}; {{langx|grc|Ἰσοκράτης}} {{IPA-el|isokrátɛ̂ːs|}}; 436–338 BC) was an ancient Greek [[rhetoric]]ian, one of the ten [[Attic orators]]. Among the most influential Greek rhetoricians of his time, Isocrates made many contributions to rhetoric and education through his teaching and written works.

Greek rhetoric is commonly traced to [[Corax of Syracuse]], who first formulated a set of rhetorical rules in the fifth century BC. His pupil [[Tisias]] was influential in the development of the rhetoric of the [[courtroom]], and by some accounts was the teacher of Isocrates. Within two generations, rhetoric had become an important art, its growth driven by social and political changes such as democracy and courts of law. Isocrates starved himself to death, two years before his 100th birthday.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Phillips |first=David D. |date=27 March 2003 |title=Orator Biographies |url=http://www.stoa.org/demos/article_orator_biographies@page=5&greekEncoding=UnicodeC.html |access-date=7 September 2020 |website= stoa.org |publisher=The Stoa}}</ref>

== Early life and influences ==
Isocrates was born into a prosperous family in [[Athens]] at the height of Athens' power shortly before the outbreak of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431–404 BC). [[Suda]] writes that Isocrates was the son of Theodorus who owned a workshop that manufactured [[aulos]]. His mother's name was Heduto. He had a sister and three brothers; two of the brothers were Tisippos ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: Τίσιππος) and Theomnestos (Ancient Greek: Θεόμνηστος).<ref name= Papillon2004>{{Cite book |author= Isocrates |translator= Terry L.

Isocrates received a first-rate education. "He is reported to have studied with several prominent teachers, including [[Tisias]] (one of the traditional founders of rhetoric), the sophists [[Prodicus]] and [[Gorgias]], and the moderate [[Oligarchy|oligarch]] [[Theramenes]], and to have associated with [[Socrates]], but these reports may reflect later views of his intellectual roots more than historical fact".<ref name= Papillon2004 />

He passed his youth in a period following the death of [[Pericles]], a time in which "wealth – both public and private – was dissipated", and "political decision were ill-conceived and violent" according to the 2020 Encyclopedia Britannica. Isocrates would have been 14 years old when the democracy voted to kill all the male citizens of the small [[Thracians|Thracian]] city of [[Scione]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Cawkwell |first=G.

Late in his life, he married a woman named Plathane (daughter of the [[sophist]] [[Hippias]]) and adopted [[Aphareus (writer)]], one of her sons by a previous marriage.<ref name= Papillon2004 />

==Career==
There is no evidence for Isocrates' participation in public life during [[Peloponnesian War]] (431–404).<ref name= Papillon2004 />

His professional career is said to have begun with [[logographer (legal)|logography]]: he was a hired courtroom [[speechwriter]]. Athenian citizens did not hire lawyers; legal procedure required self-representation. Instead, they would hire people like Isocrates to write speeches for them. Isocrates had a great talent for this and he amassed a considerable fortune. According to [[Pliny the Elder]] (''NH'' VII.30) he could sell a single oration for twenty [[Attic talent|talents]]. However, his weak voice meant that he was not himself a good public speaker. He played no direct part in state affairs, but he published many pamphlets which influenced the public and provide significant insight into major political issues of the day.<ref name="yorku1998">{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Cawkwell |first=George Law |year=1998 |entry=Isocrates |entry-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780198601654.001.0001/acref-9780198601654-e-343?rskey=P6cKCB&result=343 |access-date=18 October 2011 |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization |editor=Simon Hornblower |editor2=Antony Spawforth |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-860165-4 }}</ref> 

===Pedagogy===
Around 392 BC Isocrates set up his own school of rhetoric at the [[Lyceum]]. Prior to Isocrates, teaching consisted of first-generation Sophists, such as Gorgias and [[Protagoras]], walking from town to town as itinerants, who taught any individuals interested in political occupations how to be effective in public speaking.<ref name="Mitchell">{{Cite web |last=Mitchell |first=Gordon |title=Isocrates |url=https://www.coursesites.com/webapps/Bb-sites-course-creation-BBLEARN/courseHomepage.htmlx?course_id=_278442_1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918063412/https://www.coursesites.com/webapps/Bb-sites-course-creation-BBLEARN/courseHomepage.htmlx?course_id=_278442_1 |archive-date=18 September 2014 |access-date=1 October 2013}}</ref> Isocrates encouraged his students to wander and observe public behavior in the city (Athens) to learn through imitation. His students aimed to learn how to serve the city.<ref name="Mitchell" /> "At the core of his teaching was an [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] notion of [[arete]] ("virtue, excellence"), which could be attained by pursuing [[Philosophy|philosophia]] – not so much the dialectical study of abstract subjects like [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]] that Plato marked as "philosophy" as the study and practical application of ethics, politics and [[public speaking]]".<ref name= Papillon2004 /> The philosopher [[Plato]] (a rival of Isocrates) founded his own academy in response to Isocrates' foundation.<ref name="Mitchell" />

Isocrates accepted no more than nine pupils at a time. Many of them went on to be prominent philosophers, legislators, historians, orators, writers, and military and political leaders.<ref name= Papillon2004 /><ref name="autogenerated1990">Matsen, Patricia, Philip Rollinson, and Marion Sousa. ''Readings from Classical Rhetoric''. Southern Illinois: 1990.</ref> The first students in Isocrates' school were Athenians. However, after he published the ''Panegyricus'' in 380 BC, his reputation spread to many other parts of [[Greece]].<ref name="Norlin 1928 ix-xlvii" />  Some of his students included [[Isaeus]], [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]], [[Hypereides]], [[Ephorus]], [[Theopompus]], [[Speusippus]], and [[Timotheus (general)|Timotheus]]. Many of these students remained under the instruction of Isocrates for three to four years. Timotheus had such a great appreciation for Isocrates that he erected a statue at [[Eleusis]] and dedicated it to him.<ref name="Norlin 1928 ix-xlvii" />

==Philosophy of rhetoric==
{{Rhetoric}}
According to George Norlin, Isocrates defined rhetoric as outward feeling and inward thought of not merely expression, but reason, feeling, and imagination. Like most who studied rhetoric before and after him, Isocrates believed it was used to persuade ourselves and others, but also used in directing public affairs. Isocrates described rhetoric as "that endowment of our human nature which raises us above mere animality and enables us to live the civilized life."<ref name="Norlin 1928 ix-xlvii">{{Cite book |last=Norlin |first=George |url=https://archive.org/details/isocrateswitheng02isocuoft |title=Isocrates |date=1928 |publisher=London W. Heinemann |pages=ix–xlvii}}</ref> Isocrates unambiguously defined his approach in the speech "[[Against the Sophists]]".<ref>Readings in Classical Rhetoric By Thomas W. Benson, Michael H. Prosser. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XjrJUcEnBnsC&dq=Isocrates++against+the+sophists&pg=PA43 page 43]. {{ISBN|0-9611800-3-X}}</ref> This polemic was written to explain and advertise the reasoning and educational principles behind his new school. He promoted broad-based education by speaking against two types of teachers: the [[Eristic]]s, who disputed about theoretical and ethical matters, and the [[Sophist]]s, who taught political debate techniques.<ref name="autogenerated1990"/> Also, while Isocrates is viewed by many as being a rhetor and practicing rhetoric, he refers to his study as ''philosophia''—which he claims as his own. "Against the Sophists" is Isocrates' first published work where he gives an account of philosophy. His principal method is to contrast his ways of teaching with Sophism. While Isocrates does not go against the Sophist method of teaching as a whole, he emphasizes his disagreement with bad Sophistic practices.<ref name="Livingstone 2007 15-34">{{Cite journal |last=Livingstone |first=Niall |date=2007 |title=Writing Politics: Isocrates' Rhetoric of Philosophy |journal=Rhetorica: A Journal of the History of Rhetoric |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=15–34}}</ref>

Isocrates' program of rhetorical education stressed the ability to use language to address practical problems, and he referred to his teachings as more of a philosophy than a school of rhetoric. He emphasized that students needed three things to learn: a natural aptitude which was inborn, knowledge training granted by teachers and textbooks, and applied practices designed by educators.<ref name="autogenerated1990" /> He also stressed civic education, training students to serve the state. Students would practice composing and delivering speeches on various subjects. He considered natural ability and practice to be more important than rules or principles of rhetoric. Rather than delineating static rules, Isocrates stressed "fitness for the occasion," or ''[[kairos]]'' (the rhetor's ability to adapt to changing circumstances and situations). His school lasted for over fifty years, in many ways establishing the core of liberal arts education as we know it today, including oratory, composition, history, citizenship, culture, and morality.<ref name="autogenerated1990" />

Of the 60 orations in his name available in Roman times, 21 remained in transmission by the end of the medieval period. The earliest manuscripts dated from the ninth or tenth century, until fourth century copies of Isocrates' first three orations were found in a single [[codex]] during a 1990's excavation at [[Kellis]], a site in the [[Dakhla Oasis]] of [[Egypt]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2 October 1998 |title=Ancient Kellis |url=http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/exhibitions/egypt/xegy.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420055545/http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/exhibitions/egypt/xegy.html |archive-date=20 April 2012 |access-date=9 July 2012 |publisher=Lib.monash.edu.au}}</ref><ref>Mirhady, David C. and Yun Lee Too, ''Isocrates I'', University of Texas, 2000</ref> We have nine letters in his name, but the authenticity of four of those has been questioned.{{By whom?|date=June 2024}} He is said to have compiled a treatise, the ''Art of Rhetoric,'' but there is no known copy. Other surviving works include his autobiographical ''[[Antidosis]]'', and educational texts such as ''Against the Sophists''.

Isocrates wrote a collection of ten known orations, three of which were directed to the rulers of Salamis on Cyprus. In ''To Nicocles'', Isocrates suggests first how the new king might rule best.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Avgousti |first=Andreas |date=2023 |title=The household in Isocrates' political thought |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14748851211073728 |journal=European Journal of Political Theory |language=en |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=523–541 |doi=10.1177/14748851211073728 |s2cid=246303666 |issn=1474-8851}}</ref> For the extent of the rest of the oration, Isocrates advises Nicocles of ways to improve his nature, such as the use of education and studying the best poets and sages. Isocrates concludes with the notion that, in finding the happy mean, it is better to fall short than to go to excess. His second oration concerning Nicocles was related to the rulers of Salamis on Cyprus; this was written for the king and his subjects. Isocrates again stresses that the surest sign of good understanding is education and the ability to speak well. The king uses this speech to communicate to the people what exactly he expects of them. Isocrates makes a point in stating that courage and cleverness are not always good, but moderation and justice are. The third oration about Cyprus is an encomium to Euagoras who is the father of Nicocles. Isocrates uncritically applauds Euagoras for forcibly taking the throne of Salamis and continuing rule until his assassination in 374 BC.<ref name="Greece & Rome to 30 BC">{{Cite book |last=Beck |first=Sanderson |title=Greece & Rome to 30 BC |publisher=Ethics of Civilization |edition=Volume 4}}</ref>

Two years after his completion of the three orations, Isocrates wrote an oration for Archidamus, the prince of Sparta. Isocrates considered the settling of the Thebans colonists in Messene a violation of the Peace of Antalcidas. He was bothered most by the fact that this ordeal would not restore the true Messenians but rather the Helots, in turn making these slaves masters. Isocrates believed justice was most important, which secured the Spartan laws but he did not seem to recognize the rights of the Helots. Ten years later Isocrates wrote a letter to Archidamus, now the king of Sparta, urging him to reconcile the Greeks, stopping their wars with each other so that they could end the insolence of the Persians.<ref name="Greece & Rome to 30 BC" />

At the end of the [[Social War (357–355 BC)|Social War]] in 355 BC, 80-year-old Isocrates wrote an oration addressed to the Athenian assembly entitled ''On the Peace;'' Aristotle called it ''On the Confederacy''. Isocrates wrote this speech for the reading public, asking that both sides be given an unbiased hearing. Those in favour of peace have never caused misfortune, while those embracing war lurched into many disasters. Isocrates criticized the flatterers who had brought ruin to their public affairs.<ref name="Greece & Rome to 30 BC" />
===Antidosis===
{{Main article|Antidosis (treatise)}}

===Panathenaicus===
In ''Panathenaicus,'' Isocrates argues with a student about the literacy of the [[Sparta]]ns. In section 250, the student claims that the most intelligent of the Spartans admired and owned copies of some of Isocrates' speeches. The implication is that some Spartans had books, were able to read them, and were eager to do so. The Spartans, however, needed an interpreter to clear up any misunderstandings of double meanings which might lie concealed beneath the surface of complicated words. This text indicates that some Spartans were not illiterate. This text is important to scholars' understanding of literacy in Sparta because it indicates that Spartans were able to read and that they often put written documents to use in their public affairs.

Because of [[Plato]]'s attacks on the sophists, Isocrates' school – having its roots, if not the entirety of its mission, in rhetoric, the domain of the sophists – came to be viewed as unethical and deceitful. Yet many of Plato's criticisms are hard to substantiate in the actual work of Isocrates; at the end of ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', Plato even shows Socrates praising Isocrates (though some scholars have taken this to be sarcasm). Isocrates saw the ideal orator as someone who must possess not only rhetorical gifts, but also a wide knowledge of philosophy, science, and the arts. He promoted the Greek ideals of freedom, self-control, and virtue; in this, he influenced several Roman rhetoricians, such as [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]], and influenced the core concepts of [[liberal arts education]].{{cn|date=June 2024}}

Although Isocrates has been largely marginalized in the history of philosophy,<ref name="Matson 1957 423–427">{{Cite journal|last=Matson|first=W. I.|date=1957|title=Isocrates the Pragmatist|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|volume=10|issue=3|pages=423–427|jstor=20123586 |issn=0034-6632}}</ref> his contributions to the study and practice of rhetoric have received more attention. Thomas M. Conley argues that through Isocrates' influence on Cicero, whose writings on rhetoric were the most widely and continuously studied until the modern era, "it might be said that Isocrates, of all the Greeks, was the greatest."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Conley|first=Thomas M.|title=Rhetoric in the European tradition|date=1990|publisher=Longman|isbn=0-8013-0256-0|location=New York|oclc=20013261}}</ref> With the [[Neo-Aristotelianism (literature)|neo-Aristotelian]] turn in rhetoric, Isocrates' work sometimes gets cast as a mere precursor to Aristotle's systematic account in ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|On Rhetoric]].''<ref name="Haskins 2010">{{Cite book|last=Haskins|first=Ekaterina V.|title=Logos and power in Isocrates and Aristotle|date=2010|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-873-0|location=Columbia, S.C.|oclc=632088737}}</ref> However, Ekaterina Haskins reads Isocrates as an enduring and worthwhile counter to Aristotelian rhetoric. Rather than the Aristotelian position on rhetoric as a neutral tool, Isocrates understands rhetoric as an identity-shaping performance that activates and sustains civic identity.<ref name="Haskins 2010"/> The Isocratean position on rhetoric can be thought of as ancient antecedent to the twentieth century theorist [[Kenneth Burke]]'s conception that rhetoric is rooted in identification.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haskins|first=Ekaterina|date=July 2006|title=Choosing between Isocrates and Aristotle: Disciplinary Assumptions and Pedagogical Implications|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02773940600605552|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=191–201|doi=10.1080/02773940600605552|s2cid=145521219 |issn=0277-3945}}</ref> Isocrates' work has also been described as proto-[[Pragmatism|Pragmatist]], owing to his assertion that rhetoric makes use of probable knowledge with the aim resolving real problems in the world.<ref name="Matson 1957 423–427"/><ref>{{Cite book |editor1=Michele Kennerly |editor2=Damien Smith Pfister |date=2018 |title=Ancient rhetorics and digital networks |isbn=978-0-8173-9157-7|location=Tuscaloosa |publisher=University of Alabama Press |oclc=1021296931}}</ref>

Isocrates' innovations in the art of rhetoric paid closer attention to expression and rhythm than any other Greek writer, though because his sentences were so complex and artistic, he often sacrificed clarity.<ref name="yorku1998" />
