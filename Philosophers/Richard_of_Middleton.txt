'''Richard of Middleton''' ([[Medieval Latin]]: '''Richardus de Mediavilla'''; c. 1249 – c. 1308) was a member of the [[Franciscan Order]], a [[theology|theologian]], and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Richard's origins are unclear: he was either  [[Norman people|Norman]] French (from Menneville or [[Moyenville (disambiguation)|Moyenneville]]) or English (from Middletown).<ref>Wéber</ref> As a Bachelor of the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]] at the [[University of Paris]] in 1283, he played a part in the Franciscan commission examining [[Peter Olivi]].<ref>Amann (1937)</ref> He was [[regent master]] of the Franciscan studium in Paris from 1284 to 1287, and, on 20 September 1295 in [[Metz]], he was elected Franciscan minister provincial of France.<ref>Cross (2005)</ref> He was also subsequently tutor to [[Louis of Toulouse]], son of [[Charles II of Anjou]]. He died sometime between 1300 and 1308.<ref>Wéber</ref>

==Theology and philosophy==
[[File:Bologna, riccardo da mediavilla, commentarium... sententiarum, 1250-75 ca. 01.jpg|thumb|300px|''Commentarium...'', c. 1250-1275, [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]], Florence]]

His extant theological output is mainly contained in his two commentaries on the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]], which he edited between 1285 and 1295, three sets of [[Quodlibeta|quodlibetal disputations]] and  some 45 disputed questions.<ref>Cross (2011)</ref><ref>Cross (2005)</ref> His work is heavily influenced by his predecessors at Paris, including [[Bonaventure]], [[Henry of Ghent]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Although his philosophy owes much to the Franciscan school of thought, with regard to the plurality of forms in a single substance, for example, he also affirmed universal [[hylomorphism]], thus following [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]].<ref>Cross (2005)</ref> In this regard, he did not shy away from synthesizing [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] thought into his own philosophical reasoning, in spite of the hostility surrounding the [[Averroes|Averroist]] doctrines that were [[Condemnations of 1210-1277|condemned]] at the University of Paris in 1270 and 1277. Along with other masters of theology, his quodlibetal disputations had resonance beyond the immediate milieu of the University.<ref>Wei (1993)</ref> For example, in 1285, he was one of the masters who debated whether [[annuities]] were licit or illicit as a form of contract.<ref>Wei (2012)</ref>
