'''Eduardo Rabossi''' (1930&ndash;2005) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[philosopher]] and [[human rights]] activist.

== Biography ==
Eduardo Rabossi was born in [[Buenos Aires]] on March 20, 1930 and graduated in Law at the [[Universidad de Buenos Aires|University of Buenos Aires]] (UBA) in 1955. Afterwards, he obtained his M.A. on philosophy at [[Duke University]]. The UBA was intervened by the military government in 1966, so he resigned to his work as a teacher and worked in investigations at the Oxford university instead.<ref name="murio" /> 

He is credited as a pioneer of [[analytic philosophy]] in Argentina. He was one of the founders and president of SADAF, the Argentine Society of Analytic Philosophy and the editor of its journal, ''[[Análisis Filosófico]]''. He created that organization alongside Genario Carrió, Gregorio Klimovsky and Carlos Alchourrón, after his return from the United Kingdom.<ref name="murio" /> 

He was designated by President [[Raúl Alfonsín]] member of the [[Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas|CONADEP]], the national Commission to determine the fate of ''[[desaparecidos]]''. The work was included in the ''Nunca más'' report. He was also appointed Undersecretary of Human Rights. He was also a member of [[APDH]]. He was called as a witness in the [[Trial of the Juntas]], to explain his work for the CONADEP. He also helped Uruguay to clarify the fate of 130 Uruguayan died in Argentina during the [[Dirty War]].<ref name="murio" /> 

He died in [[Cusco|Cuzco]], [[Perú]] on November 11, 2005, while participating in a professional congress.<ref name="murio">{{cite web|url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/755956-murio-el-filosofo-eduardo-a-rabossi|title= Murió el filósofo Eduardo A.
