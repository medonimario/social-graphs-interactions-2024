The Chinese Compendium, which makes the father a local king, maintains that his mother was from the house Jinsajian, explained by Henning as the Armenian Arsacid family of Kamsarakan (Henning, 1943, p. 52, n. 4 = 1977, II, p. 115).

==Etymology==
The exact meaning of the name remains unsolved.<ref>O. Klima, Manis Zeit und Leben, Prague, 1962.</ref> It may have derived from Babylonian-Aramaic ''Mânâ'' [luminescence]. Mandaeans used the term ''mânâ rabba'', which means "Enlightened Lord/King".<ref name=":3">Arendzen, John (1910-10-01). "[https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09591a.htm Manichæism]". ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]''. Vol. 9. New York: The Encyclopedia Press, Inc.</ref> Ancient Greek interpretations were {{Transliteration|grc|skeuos}} ({{Lang|grc|σκεῦος}}, ''vessel, instrument'') and {{Transliteration|grc|homilia}} ({{Lang|grc|ὁμιλία}}, intercourse, company, communion, instruction)''.''{{Clarify | reason=How are these Greek words related to the word 'Mani'?|date=November 2019}}

The same slightly contemptuous "a certain" (Manes quidam) also appears in [[Hegemonius|Hegemonius' Acta Archelai]] (4th century), however, Hegemonius contributes a detailed description of Mani's looks. Mani’s names became the object of uplifting transformation (Greek, Coptic Mannichaios, Latin Mannichaeus, i.e., Mannam fundens "pouring out Manna"). Alternatively, due to Mani's possible origins in an [[Elcesaites|Elchasai]] community, "Mani" could be a [[Hypocorism]] of the [[Hebrew]] name [[Menahem]] ("the consoler" or "comforter").<ref>J. Tubach and M. Zakeri ‘Mani’s Name,’ in J van Oort, O Wermelinger and G Wurst editors'', Augustine and Manichaeism in the Latin West: Proceedings of the Fribourg-Utrecht International Symposium of the IAMS'' (Nag Hammadi and Manichaean Studies 49), Leiden, 2001, pg 274-275.</ref><ref name=":4" />

==Sources==
In 1969 in Upper Egypt a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] parchment codex dating to {{circa|AD&nbsp;400}} was discovered. It is now designated ''[[Cologne Mani-Codex|Codex Manichaicus Coloniensis]]'' because it is conserved at the [[University of Cologne]]. Combining a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] account of Mani's career and spiritual development with information about Mani's religious teachings, and containing fragments of his writings, it is now considered the most reliable source of information about the historical Mani.

All other medieval and pre-medieval accounts of his life are either legendary or hagiographical, such as the account in ''Fihrist'' by [[Ibn al-Nadim]], purportedly by [[al-Biruni]], or were anti-Manichaean polemics, such as the 4th-century ''[[Acta Archelai]]''. Among these medieval accounts, Ibn al-Nadim's account of Mani's life and teachings is generally speaking the most reliable and exhaustive. Notably, the (in other accounts prominent) image of the "Third Ambassador" is only represented through a brief mention of the name ''bašīr'', "messenger of good news", and the topos of "Mani the Painter" (which in other Islamic accounts almost completely replaces that of "the founder of a religion") is completely absent.<ref>W. Sundermann, "[http://www.iranica.com/articles/fehrest#iii Al-Fehrest, iii.

=== Early life ===
Mani was born near [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]], perhaps in the town Mardinu in the Babylonian district of Nahr Kutha; according to other accounts in the town Abrumya. Mani's father Pātik (Middle Persian ''Pattūg'';<ref>D. N. MacKenzie. A Concise Pahlavi Dictionary. Routledge Curzon, 2005.</ref> {{langx|grc-x-koine|Παττικιος}}, [[Arabic]]: {{Transliteration|ar|Futtuq}}), a native of [[Ecbatana]]<ref>{{britannica|362129|Mani (Iranian religious leader)}}</ref> (now [[Hamadan]], Iran), was a member of the [[Jewish Christian]] sect of the [[Elcesaites]]. His mother was of [[Parthia]]n descent<ref>{{cite book|last=Henning|first=Walter Bruno|author-link=Walter Bruno Henning|title=The Book of the Giants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVc5cAAACAAJ|year=1943|publisher=University of London|pages=52–74|quote=It is noteworthy that Mani, who was brought up and spent most of his life in a province of the Persian empire, and whose mother belonged to a famous Parthian family, did not make any use of the Iranian mythological tradition.

"</ref> (from "the [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Armenian Arsacid family]] of [[Kamsarakan]]"<ref>{{citation | last = Sundermann | first = Werner | title = Mani, the founder of the religion of Manicheism in the 3rd century CE | encyclopedia = Iranica | year = 2009 | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mani-founder-manicheism | quote = ...his mother was from the house Jinsajian, explained by Henning as the ''Armenian Arsacid family of Kamsarakan''}}.</ref>); her name is reported variously, among others ''[[Maryam (name)|Maryam]]''.

Mani was raised in a heterodox environment in Babylon. The Elcesaite community was ostensibly Jewish Christian, though with some [[Gnostic]] features due to their [[Ebionites#Judaism, Gnosticism and Essenism|Ebionite]] heritage, such as the belief in recurring incarnations of heavenly apostles, one of whom was a [[Docetism|docetic Christ]]. It is believed that his Christian roots might have been influenced by [[Marcion]] and [[Bardaisan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Dimitri Obolensky|title=The Bogomils: A Study in Balkan Neo-Manichaeism| year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521607636}}</ref> At ages 12 and 24 Mani had visionary experiences of a "heavenly twin" of his (''syzygos''), calling him to leave his father's sect and preach the true message of Jesus in a new gospel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wearring|first=Andrew|date=2008-09-19|title=Manichaean Studies in the 21st Century|url=https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/SSR/article/view/254|journal=Sydney Studies in Religion|language=en|issn=1444-5158}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Henrichs|first=Albert|date=1979|title=The Cologne Mani Codex Reconsidered|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=83|pages=339–367|doi=10.2307/311105|issn=0073-0688|jstor=311105}}</ref> It is said that his appearance was a mixture of Iranian and Mesopotamian features.

=== Travelling to India ===
Mani then travelled to India ([[Saka]]s in present day [[Afghanistan]]), where he studied [[Hinduism]] and its various extant philosophies, as well as [[Buddhism]].<ref name=Iranica/> [[Al-Biruni]] says Mani only traveled to India after being banished from Persia,<ref>{{cite book |author=Sachau |first=Edward C. |title=Alberuni's India |year=1910 |location=London |author-link=Eduard Sachau}}</ref> but this might be an error or a second journey.<ref name=Iranica/> 

=== Return from India ===
Returning in 242, Mani presented himself to [[Shapur I|Shapur&nbsp;I]], to whom he dedicated his only work written in Persian, known as the ''[[Shabuhragan]]''. Shapur was not converted to Manichaeism and remained [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]], but he favored Mani's teachings, which mixed Christianity, Buddhism and Zoroastrianism, and took him into his court.<ref name=Iranica/><ref>{{BBKL |m/mani|band=5|author=Marco Frenschkowski|artikel=Mani (iran.

He was also famed as a [[Painting|painter]].<ref name=Iranica/>

=== Imprisonment and execution ===
Shapur's successor [[Hormizd I|Hormizd&nbsp;I]], who reigned only for one year, continued to patronize Mani, but his successor [[Bahram I|Bahram&nbsp;I]], a follower of the intolerant Zoroastrian reformer [[Kartir]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shahbazi |first=A. Sh. |date=2016-07-26 |title=Bahrām I |url=https://iranicaonline.org/articles/bahram-01 |access-date=2023-03-02 |website=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica Foundation |language=en-US}}</ref> began to persecute the Manichaeans. He incarcerated Mani, who died in prison within a month, in 274. According to sources, he passed his last days comforting his visiting disciples, teaching that his death would have no other consequence than the return of his soul to the realm of light.<ref name=Iranica/>

Mani's followers depicted Mani's death as a [[crucifixion]] in a conscious analogy to the [[crucifixion of Jesus]]; al-Biruni says that Bahram ordered the execution of Mani. There is a story which claims that he was flayed, and his corpse suspended over the main gate of the great city of Gundeshapur;<ref>{{cite book |author=Al-Biruni |title=The Chronology of Ancient Nations |author-link=al-Biruni}}</ref> however, there is no historical basis for this account.<ref>Bevan, A. A. (1930). "Manichaeism". ''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics'', Volume VIII. Ed. [[James Hastings]]. London.</ref> It is more plausible that his body was mutilated via post-mortem decapitation, and his head put on display, which may be the original source of the embellishment.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |last=Sundermann |first=Werner |date=2009-07-20 |title=MANI |url=https://iranicaonline.org/articles/mani-founder-manicheism |access-date=2023-03-02 |website=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica Foundation |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Works==
The canon of Mani includes six works originally written in Syriac, and one in [[Middle Persian|Persian]], the ''[[Shabuhragan|Shapuragan]]''. While none of his books have survived in complete form, there are numerous fragments and quotations of them, including a long Syriac quotation from one of his works, as well as a large amount of material in Middle Persian, Coptic, and numerous other languages.

Examples of surviving portions of his works include: the ''Shabuhragan'' (Middle Persian), the ''[[Book of Giants]]'' (numerous fragments in many languages), the ''[[Fundamental Epistle]]'' (quoted in length by Saint Augustine), a number of fragments of his ''[[Gospel of Mani|Living Gospel]]'' (or'' Great Gospel''), a Syriac excerpt quoted by [[Theodore Bar Konai]], and his ''Letter to Edessa'' contained in the ''[[Cologne Mani-Codex]]''. Mani also wrote the book ''[[Arzhang]]'', a holy book of Manichaeism unique in that it contained many drawings and paintings to express and explain the Manichaeist creation and history of the world.

==Teaching==

In his mid-twenties, Mani decided that salvation was possible through education, self-denial, fasting and chastity. According to [[Al-Biruni]], a 10th-century Iranian scholar, Mani claimed to be the ''[[Paraclete]]'' promised in the [[New Testament]], and the [[Last Prophet]].<ref>[[Al-Biruni|al-Biruni, Muhammad ibn Ahmad]]; [[Eduard Sachau]] ed.; ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries|The Chronology of Ancient Nations]]''; [https://archive.org/stream/chronologyofanci00biru#page/190/mode/1up p. 190]; W. H. Allen & Co.; London: 1879</ref> However according to Lodewijk J. R. Ort, the term last prophet may "in all probability derived from the Quran by Al-Buruni in order to formulate Mani's pretensions and religious claims".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mani: a religio-historical description of his personality. By L. J. R. Ort. Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1967|pages=123–124}}</ref> Therefore Lodewijk J. R.

J. R. Ort|year=1967|pages=124|quote=Unfortunately the text breaks off after the coming of Mani is mentioned [...] we cannot say if this contained a pronouncement about the final character of Mani's appearance}}</ref>

According to Christian eschatology, Jesus, not Mani, will perform the final judgment at the conclusion of history.<ref>Gilles Quispel. “Hermes Trismegistus and the Origins of Gnosticism.” ''Vigiliae Christianae'', vol. 46, no. 1, 1992, p. 15. [https://doi.org/10.2307/1583880 JSTOR website] Retrieved 24 June 2023.</ref>

While his religion was not strictly a movement of Christian [[Gnosticism]] in the earlier mode, Mani did declare himself to be an "apostle of Jesus Christ",<ref name=":0" /> and extant Manichaean poetry frequently extols [[Jesus]] and his mother, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], with the highest reverence. Manichaean tradition also claims that Mani was the reincarnation of different religious figures including Jesus, [[Zoroaster]], and the [[Siddartha Gautama|historical Buddha]].

Mani's followers were organized in a church structure, divided into a class of "elects" (''electi'') and "auditors" (''auditores''). Only the ''electi'' are required to follow the laws strictly, while the ''auditores'' care for them, hoping to become ''electi'' in their turn after [[reincarnation]].

==Christian and Islamic tradition==
===Late Antique Christian accounts in the West===
The Western Christian tradition of Mani is based on [[Socrates of Constantinople]], a historian writing in the 5th century. According to this account, one [[Scythianus|Scythianos]], a Saracen, husband of an Egyptian woman, "introduced the doctrine of [[Empedocles]] and [[Pythagoras]] into Christianity"; that he had a disciple, "Buddas, formerly named [[Terebinthus]]", who travelled in Persia, where he alleged that he had been [[Miraculous births|born of a virgin]], and afterwards wrote four books, one of Mysteries, a second The Gospel, a third The Treasure, and a fourth Heads. While performing some mystic rites, he was hurled down a precipice by a [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimon]], and killed.<ref name="sacred-texts.com"/>

A woman at whose house he lodged buried him, took over his property, and bought a boy of seven, named Cubricus. This boy she freed and educated, leaving him the property and books of Buddas-Terebinthus. Cubricus then travelled into Persia, where he took the name of Manes and gave forth the doctrines of Buddas Terebinthus as his own. The king of Persia, hearing that he worked miracles, sent for him to heal his sick son, and on the child's dying put Manes in prison. Thence he escaped, flying into Mesopotamia, but was traced, captured, and flayed alive by the Persian king's orders, the skin being then stuffed with chaff and hung up before the gate of the city.<ref name="sacred-texts.com"/>

According to [[Jerome]], Archelaus wrote his account of his disputation with "Manichæus" in Syriac, whence it was translated into Greek. The Greek is lost, and the work, apart from extracts, subsists only in a Latin translation from the Greek, of doubtful age and fidelity, probably made after the 5th century. By [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] it is stated that Heraclean, [[bishop of Chalcedon]], in his book against the Manichæans, said the ''Disputation of Archelaus'' was written by one Hegemonius, an author not otherwise traceable, and of unknown date.<ref name="sacred-texts.com"/>

In the Latin narrative, "Manes" is said to have come, after his flight from court, from Arabion, a frontier fortress, to Caschar or Carchar, a town said to be in [[Roman Mesopotamia]], in the hope of converting an eminent Christian there, named Marcellus, to whom he had sent a letter beginning: "Manichæus apostle of Jesus Christ, and all the saints and virgins with me, send peace to Marcellus." In his train he brought twenty-two (or twelve) youths and virgins.<ref name="sacred-texts.com"/>

At the request of Marcellus, he debated on religion with bishop Archelaus, by whom he was vanquished, whereupon he set out to return to Persia. On his way he proposed to debate with a priest at the town of Diodorides. But Archelaus came to take the priest's place, and again defeated him, whereupon, fearing to be given up to the Persians by the Christians, he returned to Arabion.<ref name="sacred-texts.com"/>

At this stage Archelaus introduces in a discourse to the people his history of "this Manes", very much to the effect of the recapitulation in Socrates. Among the further details are these: that Scythianus lived "in the time of the Apostles", that Terebinthus said the name of Buddas had been imposed on him, that in the mountains he had been brought up by an angel, that he had been convicted of imposture by a Persian prophet named Parcus, and by Labdacus, son of [[Mithra]].<ref name="sacred-texts.com"/>

Furthermore, that in the disputation he taught concerning the sphere, the two luminaries, the transmigration of souls, and the war of the ''Principia'' against God, that "Corbicius" or Corbicus, about the age of sixty, translated the books of Terebinthus. He made three chief disciples, Thomas, Addas, and Hermas, of whom he sent the first to Egypt, and the second to Scythia, keeping the third with him. The two former returned when he was in prison, and that he sent them to procure for him the books of the Christians, which he then studied. According to the Latin narrative, finally, Manes on his return to Arabion was seized and taken to the Persian king, by whose orders he was flayed, his body being left to the birds, and his skin, filled with air, hung at the city gate.<ref name="sacred-texts.com">John M.

Mani is described as a painter who set up a sectarian movement in opposition to Zoroastrianism. He was persecuted by [[Shapur I|Shapur&nbsp;I]] and fled to [[Central Asia]], where he made disciples and embellished with paintings a ''Tchighil'' (or ''picturarum domus Chinensis'') and another temple called ''Ghalbita''. Provisioning in advance a cave which had a spring, he told his disciples he was going to heaven, and would not return for a year, after which time they were to seek him in the cave in question. They then came back there after a year and found him, whereupon he showed them an illustrated book, called ''Ergenk'', or ''Estenk'' [[Arzhang]], which he said he had brought from heaven.<ref name="sacred-texts.com"/>

Whereafter he had many followers, with whom he returned to Persia at the death of Shapur. The new king, Hormisdas, joined and protected the sect, and built Mani a castle. The next king, Bahram or Varanes, at first favoured Mani. After getting him to debate with certain Zoroastrian teachers, caused him to be flayed alive, and his skin to be stuffed and hung up. Thereupon most of his followers fled to India and China.<ref name="sacred-texts.com"/>
