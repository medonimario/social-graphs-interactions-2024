{{Nihongo|'''Tominaga Nakamoto'''|富永 仲基|Tominaga Nakamoto|1715–1746}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[philosopher]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Katō|first=Shūichi|title=Tominaga Nakamoto, 1715-1746: A Japanese Iconoclast|journal=Monumenta Nipponica|year=1967|volume=22|issue=1/2|pages=177–193|jstor=2383230|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/t2xrznwdbldbimj/1967-shuichi.pdf}}</ref> He was educated at the [[Kaitokudō]] academy founded by members of the mercantile class of Osaka, but was ostracised shortly after the age of 15. Tominaga belonged to a Japanese rationalist school of thought and advocated a Japanese variation of atheism, ''mukishinron'' (no gods or demons). He was also a [[merchant]] in [[Osaka]]. Only a few of his works survive; his ''Setsuhei'' ("Discussions on Error") has been lost and may have been the reason for his separation from the Kaitokudō, and around nine other works' titles are known.<ref name="corpus">Kato 1967, pg183</ref> The surviving works are his ''Okina no Fumi'' ("The Writings of an Old Man"),<ref>[http://www.gwern.net/docs/tominaga/okinanofumi.pdf "The Writings of an Old Man"], translator Kato Shuichi, 1967</ref> ''Shutsujō Gogo'' ("Words after Enlightenment"; on textual criticism of Buddhist sutras), and three other works on ancient musical scales, ancient measurements, and poetry.

He took a deep [[Critical theory|critical]] stance against normative systems of thought, partially based on the Kaitokudō's emphasis on objectivity, but was clearly heterodox in eschewing the dominant philosophies of the institution. He was critical of [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Shinto]].<ref>[[Tetsuo Najita]], ''Visions of Virtue'', ChicagoL UOC Press, [http://www.gwern.net/docs/tominaga/1987-najita-visionsofvirtue-excerpts.pdf pp102-106].</ref> Whereas each of these traditions drew on history as a source of authority, Tominaga saw appeals to history as a pseudo-justification for innovations that try to outdo other sects vying for power. For example, he cited the various Confucian Masters who saw human nature as partially good, neither good nor bad, all good, and inherently bad; analysing later interpreters who tried to incorporate and reconcile all Masters. He criticised Shinto as [[obscurantist]], especially in its habit of secret instruction. As he always said, "hiding is the beginning of lying and stealing".<ref>Hajime Nakamura, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sePiBcehtYcC&dq=%22Nakamoto+Tominaga+%22+lying&pg=PA487 Ways of Thinking of Eastern People: India, China, Tibet, Japan]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ketelaar|first=James Edward|title=Of Heretics and Martyrs in Meiji Japan: Buddhism and Its Persecution|year=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02481-3|pages=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dy0Wp6OpIPkC&pg=PA21}}</ref>

In his study of [[Buddhist scripture]]s, he asserted that [[Hinayana]] school of scriptures preceded [[Mahayana]] scriptures but also asserted that the vast majority of Hinayana scriptures are also composed much later than the life of [[Gautama Buddha]], the position which was later supported by modern scriptural studies. His work represents an early and indigenous example of [[Buddhist studies]] and reflects awareness of [[Manichaeism]] and its possible relationship with Buddhism.<ref name="relinjapan">{{cite book|last=Josephson |first=Jason |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=7–8|location = Chicago|year=2012|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo13657764.html}}</ref> While Michael Pye has argued that Tominaga represents a non-European example of [[religious studies]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pye |first=Michael |title=Modern Japan and the Science of Religions |url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/tominaga/2003-pye.pdf |journal=Method & Theory in the Study of Religion |year=2003 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–27 |publisher=Brill|doi=10.1163/15700680360549394 }}</ref> this view has been challenged by Jason Josephson, who argues that Tominaga does not treat non-Buddhist traditions as systematic religions.<ref name="relinjapan" />
