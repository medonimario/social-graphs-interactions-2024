==Works==
=== ''Introduction'' (''Isagoge'') ===
[[File:AverroesAndPorphyry.JPG|thumb|Imaginary debate between [[Averroes]] (1126–1198 AD) and Porphyry (234–{{Circa|305 AD}}). Monfredo de Monte Imperiali ''Liber de herbis'', 14th century.{{sfn|Sadaune|2014|p=112}}]]
Porphyry is best known for his contributions to philosophy. Apart from writing the ''Aids to the Study of the Intelligibles'' (Ἀφορμαὶ πρὸς τὰ νοητά; ''Sententiae ad Intelligibilia Ducentes''), a basic summary of Neoplatonism, he is especially appreciated for his ''Introduction to Categories'' (''Introductio in Praedicamenta'' or ''Isagoge et in Aristotelis Categorias Commentarium''), a very short work often considered to be a commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'', hence the title.{{efn|{{harvnb|Barnes| 2003| p= xiv }} outlines the history of the opinion that Porphyry meant for his ''Isagoge'' to be an introductory work to the ''Categories''.}} According to {{Harvnb|Barnes|2003}}, however, the correct title is simply ''Introduction'' (Εἰσαγωγή ''Isagoge''), and the book is an introduction not to the ''Categories'' in particular, but to logic in general, comprising as it does the theories of predication, definition, and proof. The ''Introduction'' describes how qualities attributed to things may be classified, famously breaking down the philosophical [[Substance theory|concept of substance]] into the five components ''genus'', ''species'', ''difference'', ''property'', and ''accident''. Porphyry's discussion of ''accident'' sparked a long-running debate on the application of [[Essentialism|''accident'' and ''essence'']].{{sfn|Rahman|1986|pp=271–273}}

As Porphyry's most influential contribution to philosophy, the ''Introduction to Categories'' incorporated Aristotle's logic into Neoplatonism, in particular the doctrine of the [[category of being|categories of being]] interpreted in terms of entities (in later philosophy, "[[universal (metaphysics)|universal]]"). [[Boethius]]' ''Isagoge'', a Latin translation of Porphyry's ''Introduction'', became a standard medieval textbook in European schools and universities, which set the stage for medieval philosophical-theological developments of logic and the [[problem of universals]]. In medieval textbooks, the all-important ''[[Porphyrian tree|Arbor porphyriana]]'' ("Porphyrian Tree") illustrates his logical classification of substance. To this day, taxonomy benefits from concepts in Porphyry's Tree, in classifying living organisms (see [[cladistics]]). Porphyry's invention of the "Porphyrian Tree" is noted as the first proper commentary made on Aristotle's work.
[[File:Porphyrian Trees Gallery small.png|thumb|A replica of the ''[[Arbor porphyriana]]'' (Porphyrian tree) used to comment on Aristotle's work by [[:File:Arbor porphyrii (from Purchotius' Institutiones philosophicae I, 1730).png|Purchotius]] (1730), [[:File:Arbor porphyrii (probably from one of Boethius' translations).png|Boethius]] (6th century), and [[:File:Arbor scientiae (Ramon Llull) using A porphyrii structure.png|Ramon Llull]] (ca. 1305). ]]

The ''Introduction'' was translated into Arabic by [[Ibn al-Muqaffa'|Abd-Allāh ibn al-Muqaffaʿ]] from a Syriac version. With the Arabicized name ''Isāghūjī'' (إيساغوجي) it long remained the standard introductory logic text in the Muslim world and influenced the study of theology, philosophy, grammar, and jurisprudence. Besides the adaptations and epitomes of this work, many independent works on logic by Muslim philosophers have been entitled Isāghūjī.

=== ''Philosophy from Oracles'' (''De Philosophia ex Oraculis Haurienda'') ===
Porphyry is also known as an opponent of [[Christianity]] and defender of [[Paganism]]; his precise contribution to the philosophical approach to traditional religion may be discovered in the fragments of ''Philosophy from Oracles'' (Περὶ τῆς ἐκ λογίων φιλοσοφίας; ''De Philosophia ex Oraculis Haurienda''), which was originally three books in length. There is debate as to whether it was written in his youth (as Eunapius reports<ref name="Eunapius1921" />) or closer in time to the persecutions of Christians under [[Diocletian]] and [[Galerius]].{{efn|The Christian apologist [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] states that "some Greek" might say "How can these people be thought worthy of forbearance? They have not only turned away from those who from earliest time have been thought of as divine among all Greeks and barbarians... but by emperors, law-givers and philosophers— all of a given mind... And to what sort of penalties might they not be subjected who... are fugitives from the things of their Fathers?"  This material, once thought to be part of ''Against the Christians'', but reassigned by {{harvnb|Wilken| 1979|p=}} to ''Philosophy from Oracles'', is quoted in {{harvnb|Digeser |1998| p= 129}}. However, it may not have been by Porphyry at all.{{sfn|Johnson|2010|p=53-58}} }}

Whether or not Porphyry was the pagan philosopher's opponent in [[Lactantius]]' ''Divine Institutes'', written at the time of the persecutions, has long been discussed. The fragments of the ''Philosophy from Oracles'' are only quoted by Christians, especially [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], [[Theodoret]], [[Augustine]], and [[John Philoponus]]. The fragments contain oracles identifying proper sacrificial procedure, the nature of [[astrological]] fate, and other topics relevant to Greek and Roman religion in the third century. Whether this work contradicts his treatise defending [[vegetarianism]], which also warned the philosopher to avoid animal sacrifice, is disputed among scholars.{{sfn|Johnson|2013|p=135}} Due to Porphyry’s work being incomplete or lost, the understanding of the piece could be misconstrued.<ref name=":2" />

=== ''Against the Christians'' (''Adversus Christianos'') ===
{{main_article|Against the Christians}}
[[File:Porphyrios Sucevita Fresco.jpg|right|thumb|Porphyry, a detail of the ''Tree of Jesse'', 1535, [[Sucevița Monastery]].]]
During his retirement in [[Sicily]], Porphyry wrote ''Against the Christians'' (Κατὰ Χριστιανῶν; ''Adversus Christianos'') which consisted of fifteen books. Some thirty Christian apologists, such as [[Methodius of Olympus|Methodius]], [[Eusebius]], [[Apollinaris of Laodicea|Apollinaris]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Jerome]], etc., responded to his challenge. In fact, everything known about Porphyry's arguments is found in these refutations, largely because [[Theodosius II]] ordered [[Book burning#Christian book burnings|every copy burned]] in AD 435 and again in 448.{{sfn|Digeser| 1998|p=130|ps=: "Constantine and other emperors banned and burned Porphyry's work".}}{{sfn|Socrates Scholasticus|1885|pp=Book I, Ch 9, pp. 30–31|loc=Letter of Constantine proscribing the works of Porphyry and Arius}}{{sfn|Stevenson|1987|p=|ps=: Gelasius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', II.36}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and the 5th-century ecclesiastical historian [[Socrates of Constantinople]] assert that Porphyry was once a Christian.{{sfn|Socrates Scholasticus|1885b|pp= Book III, Ch 23}} It is said, however, that while Porphyry did engage with Christianity, he did not believe it. Augustine made comments to Porphyry as he said he was the "most learned of the philosophers, as the most bitter enemy of the Christians".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=Gillian |title=Augustine's Porphyry and the Universal Way of Salvation |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007}}</ref>

=== Other works ===
Porphyry was opposed to the [[theurgy]] of his disciple [[Iamblichus]]. Much of Iamblichus' mysteries is dedicated to the defense of mystic theurgic divine possession against the critiques of Porphyry. French philosopher [[Pierre Hadot]] maintains that for Porphyry, spiritual exercises are an essential part of spiritual development.{{sfn|Hadot|1995|p=100}}

Porphyry was, like [[Pythagoras]], an advocate of [[vegetarianism]] on spiritual and ethical grounds. These two philosophers are perhaps the most famous vegetarians of classical antiquity. He wrote the ''[[On Abstinence from Animal Food]]'' (Περὶ ἀποχῆς ἐμψύχων; ''De Abstinentia ab Esu Animalium''), advocating against the consumption of animals, and he is cited with approval in vegetarian literature up to the present day. He believed that everything was created for mutual advantage, and vegetarianism was a way to preserve universal harmony of nature.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Williams |first=Howard |date=April 25, 2023 |title=The Ethics of Diet |url=https://ivu.org/history/williams/porphyry.html |website=International Vegetarian Union}}</ref>

Porphyry also wrote widely on [[music theory]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Richter |first=Lukas |year=2001 |encyclopedia=[[Grove Music Online]] |title=Porphyry |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |accessdate=25 September 2021 |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.22125 |isbn=978-1-56159-263-0 |url-access=subscription |url=https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000022125 }} {{Grove Music subscription}}</ref> [[astrology]], religion, and philosophy. He produced a ''History of Philosophy'' (''Philosophos Historia'') with ''[[Biography|vitae]]'' of philosophers that included a life of his teacher, Plotinus. His life of Plato from book iv exists only in quotes by [[Cyril of Alexandria]].{{efn|{{harvnb|Notopoulos|1940|pp= 284–293}} attempted a reconstruction from Apuleius' use of it.}} His book ''Vita Pythagorae'' on the life of [[Pythagoras]] is not to be confused with the book of the same name by [[Iamblichus]]. His commentary on [[Ptolemy#Music|Ptolemy's ''Harmonics'']]<ref name="toxolyros.gr" /> (''Eis ta Harmonika Ptolemaiou hypomnēma'') is an important source for the history of ancient harmonic theory.

Porphyry also wrote about [[Homer]]. Apart from several lost texts known only from quotations by other authors, two texts survive at least in large parts: the ''Homeric Questions'' (''Homēriká zētḗmata'', largely a philological comment on the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'') and ''[[On the Cave of the Nymphs in the Odyssey]]'' (''Peri tou en Odysseia tōn nymphōn antrou'').

Porphyry's commentary on [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' was used as a source by [[Pappus of Alexandria]].<ref name="MacTutor" />
