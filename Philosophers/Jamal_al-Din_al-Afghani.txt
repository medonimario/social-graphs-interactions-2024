==Political activism==
At the age of 17 or 18 in 1856–57,<ref name="Iranica"/> Al-Afghani traveled to [[British Raj|British India]] and spent several years there studying religions. In 1859, a [[United Kingdom|British]] spy reported that Al-Afghani was possible [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[special agent|agent]]. The British representatives reported that he wore the traditional clothes of the [[Nogais]] of [[Central Asia]] and spoke [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] fluently.<ref name="Astane">Molefi K. Asante, ''Culture and Customs of Egypt'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002,  {{ISBN|978-0-313-31740-8}}, p. 137</ref>

After this first Indian tour, he decided to perform the [[Hajj]]. His first documents are dated from Fall 1865, where he mentions leaving the "revered place" (''makān-i Musharraf'') and arriving in Tehran around mid-December of the same year. In the spring of 1866, he left Iran for Afghanistan, passing through [[Mashhad]] and [[Herat]].
{{blockquote|After the Indian stay, all sources have Afghānī next take a leisurely trip to Mecca, stopping at several points along the way. Both the standard biography and Lutfallāh's account take Afghānī's word that he entered Afghan government service before 1863, but since documents from Afghanistan show that he arrived there only in 1866, we are left with several years unaccounted for. The most probable supposition seems to be that he may have spent longer in India than he later said and that after going to Mecca he traveled elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire. When he arrived in Afghanistan in 1866 he claimed to be from [[Constantinople]], and he might not have made this claim if he had never even seen the city, and could be caught in ignorance of it.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Islamic response to imperialism: political and religious writings of Sayyid Jamāl ad-Dīn "al-Afghānī" |last1=Keddie |first1=Nikki R |year=1983|publisher=University of California Press|location=United States|isbn= 978-0-520-04774-7|pages=11–14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThR-B9BmWdYC}}</ref>|[[Nikki Keddie]]|1983}} He was spotted in Afghanistan in 1866 and spent time in [[Kandahar]], [[Ghazni]], and Kabul.<ref name="Britannica" />

Reports from the colonial British Indian and [[Second Anglo-Afghan Treaty (1857)|Afghan]] government stated that he was a stranger in Afghanistan and spoke [[Iranian Persian]], following a European lifestyle and not observing Muslim practices, including [[Ramadan]].<ref name="Astane" /> He became counselor to [[Mohammad Afzal Khan]], the eldest son of the former [[emir]], [[Dost Mohammad Khan]], during his [[Afghan Civil War (1863–1869)|war against his half-brother]] [[Sher Ali Khan]]. He encouraged Muhammad Afzal to turn away from his father's British-aligned policy and turn to the [[Russian Empire]] for support.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mishra |first1=Pankaj |title=From the Ruins of Empire: The Revolt Against the West and the Remaking of Asia |publisher=Penguin Books |page=54}}</ref> In 1868, Sher Ali Khan prevailed against Muhammad Afzal and expelled al-Afghani from the country.<ref name="Iranica" />

Al-Afghani traveled to [[Istanbul]], passing through India<ref name="Iranica"/> and [[Cairo]] on his way there. He stayed in Cairo long enough to meet a young student who would become a devoted disciple of his, [[Muhammad Abduh]].<ref>Albert Hourani, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'' (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1983), pp. 131–132</ref> Once in Istanbul, he met with Grand Vizier [[Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha]] and secured an appointment to the Council of Education. He spoke at the opening of [[Istanbul University]], giving a speech typifying the Modernist spirit animating the ongoing [[Tanzimat]].
{{blockquote|Are we not going to take an example from the civilized nations? Let us cast a glance at the achievement of others.

However, conservative clerics found his views too radical. The university was closed in 1871 and al-Afghani was expelled.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mishra |first1=Pankaj |title=From the Ruins of Empire: The Revolt Against the West and the Remaking of Asia |publisher=Penguin Books |page=71}}</ref> He then moved to the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] and began preaching his ideas of political reform. The Egyptian government originally gave him a stipend, but due to his public attacks on France and England, he was exiled to India in August 1879, where he stayed in [[Hyderabad]] and [[Calcutta]].<ref name="Iranica"/> He then traveled to Istanbul, London, Paris, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Munich.

While in Egypt, Afghani sought the removal of the ruling regime of [[Isma'il Pasha of Egypt]], which he viewed as pro-British, and used [[Freemasonry]] as an organizational base for his political activities. During this period, Afghani had also considered assassinating Khedive Isma'il. He perceived Freemasonry as a means of advancing his anti-colonial, [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]], [[Pan-Islamism|pan-Islamic]] causes. Afghani's political activities would play a decisive role in overthrowing Isma'il from the throne and bringing [[Tewfik Pasha]] as khedive.<ref>Karim Wissa, "Freemasonry in Egypt 1798–1921″.

However, local Masons asserted that they were not interested in politics and sought reconciliation with the British Empire.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kudsi-Zadeh|first=A.

In 1884, he began publishing an Arabic newspaper in Paris entitled ''[[al-Urwah al-Wuthqa]]'' ({{langx|ar|العرو الوثقى||The Indissoluble Link}}<ref name="Britannica" />) with Muhammad Abduh; the title is taken from [[Quran 2:256]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&verse=256|title=The Quranic Arabic Corpus – Translation|website=corpus.quran.com|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> The newspaper called for a return to the original principles and ideals of Islam, and greater unity among Islamic peoples. He argued that this would allow the Islamic community to regain its former strength against European powers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

When al-Afgani was visiting [[Bushehr]] in southern Iran in the spring of 1886, planning to pick up books he had shipped there and carry on to Russia, he fell ill. He was invited by [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]]'s Minister of Press and Publications to come to Tehran, but fell from favor quite quickly. The Emperor ordered him to be taken to Russia, where al-Afghani spent 1887 to 1889.<ref name="Iranica"/>

From Russia, he traveled to Munich, returning to Iran in late 1889.<ref name="Iranica"/> Due to his political activities, the Shah planned to expel him from Iran, but al-Afghani found out and took sanctuary in the [[Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine]] near Tehran.<ref name="Iranica"/> After seven months of preaching to admirers from the shrine, he was arrested in 1891, transported to the border with Ottoman Iraq and expelled from Iran. Although Al-Afghani quarreled with most of his patrons, it is said he "reserved his strongest hatred for the Shah," whom he accused of weakening Islam by granting [[concession (contract)|concessions]] to Europeans and squandering the money earned thereby. His agitation against the Shah is thought to have been one of the "fountain-heads" of the successful 1891 [[Tobacco Protest]] against the grant of a tobacco monopoly to a British company, and the later 1905 [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution]].<ref>Roy Mottahedeh, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'' (Oxford: One World, 2000), pp. 183–184</ref>

After Iraq, he went to England in 1891 and 1892.<ref name="Iranica"/> He was later invited by a member of [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdul Hamid II]]'s court in 1892 to Istanbul. He traveled there with diplomatic immunity from the British Embassy, which raised many eyebrows, but was granted a house and salary by the Sultan. Abdul Hamid II aimed to use al-Afghani for Pan-Islamist propagation.

While in Istanbul in 1895, al-Afghani was visited by a Persian ex-prisoner, [[Mirza Reza Kermani]], who had been his servant and disciple,<ref name="Iranica"/> and together they planned the assassination of Emperor Naser al-Din of Iran.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A history of Iran: Empire of the Mind |last=Axworthy|first=Michael|date= 2016|isbn=978-0-465-09876-7|page=198|oclc=914195458}}</ref> They both collaborated with [[Mirza Malkam Khan]], the former Qajar envoy to London, in his London-based paper ''[[Qanun (newspaper)|Qanun]]'' to attack Qajar rule.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Camron Michael Amin|title=The Press and Public Diplomacy in Iran, 1820–1940|journal=Iranian Studies|date=2015|volume=48|issue=2|page=273

==Political and religious views==
Al-Afghani's ideology has been described as a welding of "traditional" religious antipathy toward non-Muslims "to a modern critique of Western [[imperialism]] and an appeal for the unity of Islam", urging the adoption of Western sciences and institutions that might strengthen Islam.<ref name="Kramer" /> According to Muhammad Abduh, Al-Afghani's main struggle in life was to decrease British domination of eastern nations and to minimize its power over Muslims.<ref>{{Cite book  |first1= Anne R. |last1=Richards|first2= Iraj |last2=Omidvar|title=Historic Engagements with Occidental Cultures, Religions, Powers|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=978-1-137-40502-9|page=120|chapter=Chapter 5: Two Muslim Travelers to the West in the Nineteenth Century}}</ref>

Al-Afghani's friend, the British poet, and Arabophile [[Wilfrid Scawen Blunt]],<ref>Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, ''Secret History of the English Occupation of Egypt'' (London: Unwin, 1907), p. 100.</ref> considered him a liberal, and in some of his writings he equates the parliamentary system to the [[shura]] (consultation) system mentioned in the Qur'an. However, his attitude to the constitutional government was ambiguous because he doubted that it was viable in the Islamic world.<ref>Ana Belén Soage, "Shūrà and Democracy: Two Sides of the Same Coin?", ''Religion Compass'' 8/3, p. 98.</ref> According to his biographer, he envisioned instead "the overthrow of individual rulers who were lax or subservient to foreigners and their replacement by strong and patriotic men."<ref>Nikki R. Keddie, ''Sayyid Jamal ad-Din 'al-Afghani': A Political Biography'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1972), pp. 225–26.</ref>

Blunt, [[Jane Digby]] and [[Richard Francis Burton]], were close with [[Emir Abdelkader]] (1808–1883), an Algerian Islamic scholar, Sufi, and military leader. In 1864, the Lodge "Henry IV" extended an invitation to him to join Freemasonry, which he accepted, being initiated at the Lodge of the Pyramids in Alexandria, Egypt.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofabdelkader00churrich|title=The life of Abdel Kader, ex-sultan of the Arabs of Algeria; written from his dictation, and comp. from other authentic sources|last=Churchill|first=Charles Henry|date=1867|publisher=London, Chapman and Hall|others=University of California Libraries}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kudsi-Zadeh |first1=A.

When Blunt visited Abdelkader in 1881, he decided that he was the most promising candidate for caliph, an opinion shared by Afghani and his disciple, Muhammad Abduh.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=U1FTZKQ5wTsC&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA81|title=Initiates of Theosophical Masters|last=Johnson|first=K. Paul|date=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791425558|language=en}}</ref>

According to another source Al-Afghani was greatly disappointed by the failure of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and came to three principal conclusions from it:
* that European imperialism, having conquered India, now threatened the Middle East.
* that Asia, including the Middle East, could prevent the onslaught of Western powers only by immediately adopting modern technology like the West.
* that Islam, despite its traditionalism, was an effective creed for mobilizing the public against the imperialists.<ref>Ervand Abrahamian, ''Iran Between Two Revolutions'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982), pp. 62–63</ref>

Al-Afghani held that [[Hindu-Muslim unity|Hindus and Muslims should work together]] to overthrow British rule in India, a view rehashed by [[Hussain Ahmed Madani]] in ''[[Composite Nationalism and Islam]]'' five decades later.<ref name="Aslam2011">{{cite web |last1=Aslam |first1=Arshad |title=The Politics Of Deoband |url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/the-politics-of-deoband/277847 |publisher=[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook]] |language=en |date=28 July 2011 }}</ref>

He believed that Islam and its revealed law were compatible with rationality and, thus, Muslims could become politically unified while still maintaining their faith based on religious social morality. These beliefs had a profound effect on Muhammad Abduh, who went on to expand on the notion of [[Mu'amalat]], using rationality in the human relations aspect of Islam.<ref>Albert Hourani, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'' (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1983), pp. 104–125</ref>

In 1881 he published a collection of polemics titled ''Al-Radd ʻalā al-dahrīyīn'' "Refutation of the Materialists", agitating for pan-Islamic unity against Western imperialism. It included one of the earliest pieces of Islamic thought arguing against [[Charles Darwin]]'s then-recent ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''; however, his arguments allegedly incorrectly caricatured [[evolutionary biology]], provoking criticism that he had not read Darwin's writings.<ref name="glick1">'' The Comparative Reception of Darwinism'', edited by Thomas Glick, {{ISBN|0-226-29977-5}}</ref> In his later work ''Khatirat Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani'' "The memoir of Al-Afghani", he accepted the validity of evolution, asserting that the Islamic world had already known and used it. Although he accepted [[abiogenesis]] and the evolution of animals, he rejected the theory that the human species is the product of evolution, arguing that humans have [[soul]]s.<ref name="glick1"/>

Among the reasons why Al-Afghani was thought to have had a less than deep religious faith<ref>Kedourie, Elie ''Afghani and Abduh: An Essay on Religious Unbelief and Political Activism in Modern Islam'' (1966, New York, Humanities Press)</ref> was his lack of interest in finding theological common ground between the Shia and the Sunni despite his interest in political unity between the two groups.<ref>Nasr, ''The Shia Revival'', p.103</ref> For example, when he moved to Istanbul he disguised his Twelver Shi'i background by labeling himself "the Afghan".<ref>[[Ervand Abrahamian]], ''Iran Between Two Revolutions'', Princeton University Press, p. 65</ref>

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Asadabadi square, Tehran2.JPG|thumb|Asad Abadi Square in [[Tehran]], Iran]]
Al-Afghani died of cancer of the jaw<ref name="Iranica"/> on 9 March 1897 in Istanbul and was buried there. In late 1944, at the request of the Afghan government, his remains were taken to Afghanistan via British India. His funeral was offered in [[Peshawar]]'s [[Qissa Khwani Bazaar]] in front of the Afghan Consulate building. Thereafter, his remains were laid in Kabul inside the [[Kabul University]]; a mausoleum was also erected there in his memory. In October 2002, the American Ambassador to Afghanistan, [[Robert Finn (diplomat)|Robert Finn]], pledged a donation of $25,000 to restore the mausoleum from damage sustained during the civil war.<ref name="Mishra">{{cite book |last1=Mishra |first1=Pankaj |title=From the Ruins of Empire: The Revolt Against the West and the Remaking of Asia |publisher=Penguin Books |page=118}}</ref> The repairs were completed in 2010.

In Afghanistan, a university is named after him (''[[Syed Jamaluddin Afghan University]]'') in Kabul. There is also a street in the center of Kabul which is called by the name Afghani. In other parts of Afghanistan, there are many places like hospitals, schools, Madrasas, Parks, and roads named after Jamaluddin Afghan.

In [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]] there is a road named after him as well.

In Tehran, the capital of Iran, there is a square and a street named after him (''Asad Abadi Square'' and "Asad Abadi Avenue" in [[Yusef Abad]])

According to [[K. Paul Johnson]], in ''The Masters Revealed'', [[Helena Blavatsky|H.P. Blavatsky]]'s masters were real people, and "Serapis Bey" was Jamal Afghani, as a purported leader of an order named the "[[Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor|Brotherhood of Luxor]]".<ref name="Johnson 1995">{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=U1FTZKQ5wTsC&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA2|title=Initiates of Theosophical Masters|last=Johnson|first=K. Paul|date=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2555-8|language=en}}</ref> Afghani was introduced to the Star of the East Lodge, of which he became the leader, by its founder Raphael Borg, the British consul in Cairo, who was in communication with Blavatsky. Afghani's friend, a Jewish-Italian actor from Cairo named [[Yaqub Sanu|James Sanua]], who with his girlfriend Lydia Pashkov and their friend [[Jane Digby|Lady Jane Digby]] were travel companions of Blavatsky.<ref name="Johnson 1995" /> As concluded by [[Joscelyn Godwin]] in ''The Theosophical Enlightenment'', "If we interpret the 'Brotherhood of Luxor' to refer to the coterie of esotericists and magicians that Blavatsky knew and worked with in Egypt, then we should probably count Sanua and Jamal ad-Din as members."<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wbzy7A4Zo3MC&q=Sanua+and+Jamal+ad-Din|title=Theosophical Enlightenment|last=Godwin|first=Joscelyn |date=28 October 1994|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2152-9|language=en}}</ref>

In the early 1860s, he was in [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} when Blavatsky was in [[Tbilisi]]. In the late 1860s, he was in Afghanistan until he was expelled and returned to India. He went to Istanbul and was again expelled in 1871 when he proceeded to Cairo, where his circle of disciples was similar to Blavatsky's Brotherhood of Luxor. Afghani was forced to leave Egypt and settled in Hyderabad, India, in 1879, the year the Theosophical Society's founders arrived in Bombay. He then left India and spent a short time in Egypt before arriving in Paris in 1884. The following year he proceeded to London, and then on to Russia where he collaborated with Blavatsky's publisher, [[Mikhail Katkov]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=U1FTZKQ5wTsC&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA50|title=Initiates of Theosophical Masters|last=Johnson|first=K.

==Notes==
:{{note|Alpha|α}}. Some Western academics point out that the term "Pan-Islamism" never existed before al-Afghani. The Arabic term [[Ummah]], which is [[Ummah#Usage of Ummah in the Qur'an|found in the Quran]],<ref>e.g. {{qref|21|91|b=y}}</ref> however, was historically used to denote the Muslim nation altogether, surpassing race, ethnicity, etc.<ref name=Watt>{{cite book|last=Watt|first=W. Montgomery|title=Muhammad at Medina|year=1972|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}</ref> and this term has been used in a political sense by classical Islamic scholars e.g. such as [[al-Mawardi]] in Ahkam al-Sultaniyyah, where he discusses the contract of Imamate of the Ummah, "prescribed to succeed Prophethood" in the protection of the religion and of managing the affairs of the world.<ref>Ahkam al-Sultaniyyah by al-Mawardi, Chapter 1</ref><ref>Fauzan, Ahmad.
