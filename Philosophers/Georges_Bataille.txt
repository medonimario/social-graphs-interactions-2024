'''Georges Albert Maurice Victor Bataille''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɑː|ˈ|t|aɪ}}; {{IPA|fr|ʒɔʁʒ batɑj|lang}}; 10 September 1897 – 8 July 1962) was a French [[philosopher]] and [[intellectual]] working in [[philosophy]], [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[history of art]]. His writing, which included [[essays]], [[novels]], and [[poetry]], explored such subjects as [[eroticism]], [[mysticism]], [[surrealism]], and [[Transgressive fiction|transgression]]. His work would prove influential on subsequent schools of [[philosophy]] and [[social theory]], including [[poststructuralism]].<ref>Michael Richardson, [https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/georges-bataille-essential-writings/book206155 ''Georges Bataille: Essential Writings''], SAGE, 1998, p. 232.</ref>

==Early life==
Georges Bataille was the son of Joseph-Aristide Bataille (b. 1851), a [[tax collector]] (later to go blind and be paralysed by [[neurosyphilis]]), and Antoinette-Aglaë Tournarde (b. 1865). Born on 10 September 1897 in [[Billom]] in the region of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], his family moved to [[Reims]] in 1898, where he was baptized.<ref>This fact is not mentioned in the biography by [[Michel Surya]], but see the Chronology in Georges Bataille, ''Romans et récits'', Pléiade, 2004, p. xciv.</ref> He went to school in [[Reims]] and then [[Épernay]]. Although brought up without religious observance, he converted to Catholicism in 1914, and became a devout Catholic for about nine years. He considered entering the [[priest]]hood and attended a Catholic seminary briefly. However, he quit, apparently in part in order to pursue an occupation where he could eventually support his mother. He eventually renounced Christianity in the early 1920s.<ref>[[Michel Surya]], ''Georges Bataille: an intellectual biography'', 2002; Georges Bataille, ''Choix de lettres'' (Paris: NRF), 1997.</ref>

Bataille attended the [[École Nationale des Chartes]] in [[Paris]], graduating in February 1922. He graduated with a [[bachelor's thesis]] titled ''L'ordre de la chevalerie, conte en vers du xiiie siècle, avec introduction et notes''. Though he is often referred to as an [[archivist]] and a [[librarian]] because of his employment at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], his work there was with the medallion collections (he also published scholarly articles on [[numismatics]]). His thesis at the École des Chartes was a critical edition of the medieval poem ''[[Ordene de chevalerie|L'Ordre de chevalerie]]'' which he produced directly by classifying the eight manuscripts from which he reconstructed the poem. After graduating he moved to the School of Advanced Spanish Studies in [[Madrid]]. As a young man, he befriended, and was much influenced by, the Russian [[existentialist]] [[Lev Shestov]], who schooled him in the writing of [[Nietzsche]], [[Dostoyevsky]], and [[Plato]] as well as Shestov's own critique of [[reason]] and philosophical systematization.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

==Career==
Founder of several journals and literary groups, Bataille is the author of a large and diverse body of work: readings, poems, essays on innumerable subjects (on the [[mysticism]] of economy, [[poetry]], philosophy, [[the arts]] and eroticism). He sometimes published under pseudonyms, and some of his publications were banned.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} He was relatively ignored during his lifetime and scorned by contemporaries such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] as an advocate of [[mysticism]], but after his death had considerable influence on authors such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Philippe Sollers]], and [[Jacques Derrida]], all of whom were affiliated with the journal ''[[Tel Quel]]''. His influence is felt most explicitly in the phenomenological work of [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], but is also significant for the work of [[Jean Baudrillard]], the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories of [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Julia Kristeva]], and recent anthropological work from the likes of [[Michael Taussig]].

Initially attracted to [[Surrealism]], Bataille quickly fell out with its founder [[André Breton]], although Bataille and the Surrealists resumed cautiously cordial relations after [[World War II]]. Bataille was a member of the extremely influential [[College of Sociology]] which included several other renegade surrealists. He was heavily influenced by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Marcel Mauss]], the [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Alexandre Kojève]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],<ref>In an 'Autobiographical Note', Bataille describes his encounter with Nietzsche's writings in 1923 as "decisive" (Georges Bataille, ''My Mother, Madame Edwarda, The Dead Man'', trans. A. Wainhouse, London, 1989, p. 218 as quoted in Michael Weston, ''Philosophy, Literature and the Human Good'', Routledge, p. 19).</ref> the last of whom he defended in a notable essay against appropriation by the [[Nazis]].<ref name=Bataille>Bataille, Georges. "[http://i.a.m.free.fr/acephale/nietzsheetlesfascistes.html Nietzsche and Fascists]", ''[[Acéphale]]'', January 1937'</ref>

Fascinated by [[human sacrifice]], he founded a secret society, ''[[Acéphale]]'', the symbol of which was a headless man. According to legend, Bataille and the other members of Acéphale each agreed to be the sacrificial victim as an inauguration; none of them would agree to be the executioner. An indemnity was offered for an executioner, but none was found before the dissolution of Acéphale shortly before the war. The group also published an eponymous review of Nietzsche's philosophy which attempted to postulate what Derrida has called an "anti-[[sovereignty]]". Collaborators in these projects included [[André Masson]], [[Pierre Klossowski]], [[Roger Caillois]], [[:Fr:Jules Monnerot|Jules Monnerot]], [[Jean Rollin]] and [[Jean Wahl]]. The German philosopher and cultural critic, [[Walter Benjamin]], described Bataille and Acéphale’s fascination with sacrifice as a “pre-fascist aestheticism”.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Nguyen | first = Duy Lap | title = Walter Benjamin and the Critique of Political Economy.| location = London | publisher = Bloomsbury academic | date = 2022 |pages = 216–223}}</ref>

Bataille drew from diverse influences and used various modes of discourse to create his work. His novel ''[[Story of the Eye]]'' (''Histoire de l'oeil''), published under the pseudonym Lord Auch (literally, Lord "to the shithouse" — "auch" being short for "aux chiottes," slang for telling somebody off by sending him to the toilet), was initially read as pure [[pornography]], while interpretation of the work has gradually matured to reveal the same considerable philosophical and emotional depth that is characteristic of other writers who have been categorized within "[[transgressional fiction|literature of transgression]]". The imagery of the novel is built upon a series of metaphors which in turn refer to philosophical constructs developed in his work: the eye, the egg, the sun, the earth, the testicle.

Other famous novels include the [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously published]] ''My Mother'' (which would become the basis of [[Christophe Honoré]]'s film ''[[Ma Mère]]''), ''The Impossible'' and ''[[Blue of Noon]]'', which, with its [[incest]], [[necrophilia]],<ref name=kendall>{{cite book|last1=Kendall|first1=Stuart|title=Georges Bataille|date=2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1861893277|page=206|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1861893272|access-date=27 August 2014}}</ref> politics, and autobiographical undertones, is a much darker treatment of contemporary historical reality.

During World War II Bataille produced ''Summa Atheologica'' (the title parallels [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''[[Summa Theologica]]'') which comprises his works ''[[Inner Experience]]'', ''Guilty'', and ''On Nietzsche''. After the war he composed ''[[La Part maudite|The Accursed Share]]'', which he said represented thirty years' work. The singular conception of "[[sovereignty]]" expounded there would become an important topic of discussion for Derrida, [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] and others. Bataille also founded the influential journal ''Critique''.

==Personal life==
Bataille's first marriage was to actress [[Sylvia Bataille|Silvia Maklès]], in 1928; they divorced in 1934, and she later married the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]. Bataille also had an affair with [[Colette Peignot]], who died in 1938. In 1946 Bataille married Diane de Beauharnais (author, pseudonym, Selena Warfield),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bak |first1=Hans |title=Uneasy Alliance: Twentieth-century American Literature, Culture and Biography |date=2004 |publisher=Rodopi |isbn=9789042016118 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pX9ay5L8kHMC  |page=217 |language=en}}</ref> with whom he had a daughter.

In 1955 Bataille was diagnosed with cerebral [[arteriosclerosis]], although he was not informed at the time of the terminal nature of his illness.<ref name="surya">[[Michel Surya|Surya, Michel]]. ''Georges Bataille: An Intellectual Biography'', 2002, p. 474.</ref> He died seven years later, on 8 July 1962.<ref name="surya"/>

Bataille was an [[Atheism|atheist]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Georges Bataille|year=2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|author=Stuart Kendall|quote="An atheist in a deeply Catholic country, he rejected Surrealism, Marxism and Existentialism in turn."}}</ref>

==Key concepts==
===Base materialism<!--'Base materialism' redirects here-->===
Bataille developed '''base materialism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> during the late 1920s and early 1930s as an attempt to break with mainstream [[materialism]], which he viewed as a subtle form of idealism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Visions of Excess: Selected Writings, 1927-2939|last=Bataille|first=Georges|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0816612833|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=15–16}}</ref> He argues for the concept of an active base matter that disrupts the opposition of high and low and destabilises all foundations. Inspired by [[Gnostic]] ideas, this notion of materialism defies strict definition and rationalisation. Base materialism was a major influence on Derrida's [[deconstruction]], and both thinkers attempt to destabilise philosophical oppositions by means of an unstable "third term." Bataille's notion of materialism may also be seen as anticipating [[Louis Althusser]]'s conception of [[aleatory materialism]] or "materialism of the encounter," which draws on similar atomist metaphors to sketch a world in which causality and actuality are abandoned in favor of limitless possibilities of action.

===The "accursed share"===
''[[The Accursed Share|La Part maudite]]'' is a book written by Bataille between 1946 and 1949, when it was published by Les Éditions de Minuit. It was translated into English and published in 1991, with the title ''The Accursed Share''. It presents a new economic theory, which Bataille calls "general economy," as distinct from the "restricted" economic perspective of most economic theory. Thus, in the theoretical introduction, Bataille writes the following:

<blockquote>I will simply state, without waiting further, that the extension of economic growth itself requires the overturning of economic principles—the overturning of the ethics that grounds them. Changing from the perspectives of restrictive economy to those of general economy actually accomplishes a Copernican transformation: a reversal of thinking—and of ethics. If a part of wealth (subject to a rough estimate) is doomed to destruction or at least to unproductive use without any possible profit, it is logical, even inescapable, to surrender commodities without return. Henceforth, leaving aside pure and simple dissipation, analogous to the construction of the Pyramids, the possibility of pursuing growth is itself subordinated to giving: The industrial development of the entire world demands of Americans that they lucidly grasp the necessity, for an economy such as theirs, of having a margin of profitless operations. An immense industrial network cannot be managed in the same way that one changes a tire… It expresses a circuit of cosmic energy on which it depends, which it cannot limit, and whose laws it cannot ignore without consequences. Woe to those who, to the very end, insist on regulating the movement that exceeds them with the narrow mind of the mechanic who changes a tire.<ref>Georges Bataille, The Accursed Share, Volume 1: Consumption, trans. Robert Hurley (New York: Zone Books, 1991). {{ISBN|9780942299205}}.</ref></blockquote>
{{Critique of political economy sidebar}}
Thus, according to Bataille's theory of consumption, the accursed share is that excessive and non-recuperable part of any economy which is destined to one of two modes of economic and social expenditure. This must either be spent luxuriously and knowingly without gain in the arts, in non-procreative sexuality, in spectacles and sumptuous monuments, or it is obliviously destined to an outrageous and catastrophic outpouring in war. Though the distinction is less apparent in [[Robert Hurley (translator)|Hurley]]'s English translation, Bataille introduces the neologism "consummation" (akin to a fire's burning) to signal this excess expenditure as distinct from "consommation" (the non-excess expenditure more familiarly treated in theories of "restricted" economy).

The notion of "excess" energy is central to Bataille's thinking. Bataille's inquiry takes the superabundance of energy, beginning from the infinite outpouring of solar energy or the surpluses produced by life's basic chemical reactions, as the norm for organisms. In other words, an organism in Bataille's general economy, unlike the rational actors of classical economy who are motivated by scarcity, normally has an "excess" of energy available to it. This extra energy can be used productively for the organism's growth or it can be lavishly expended. Bataille insists that an organism's growth or expansion always runs up against limits and becomes impossible. The wasting of this energy is "luxury." The form and role luxury assumes in a society, are characteristic of that society. "The accursed share" refers to this excess, destined for waste, which he calls "dépense" (French for expenditure). This non-productive expenditure of excess energy, which transcends the mere requirements for survival, challenges traditional economic paradigms by emphasizing the importance of unproductive uses of surplus that contribute to societal and cultural enrichment, rather than mere economic growth. Bataille's exploration of dépense highlights the philosophical and existential dimensions of how societies utilize their surplus resources.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bataille |first=Georges |title=La Notion de dépense |date=January 1933 |publisher=La Critique Sociale. 7: 7–15 |year=1933}}</ref>

Crucial to the formulation of the theory was Bataille's reflection upon the phenomenon of [[potlatch]]. It is influenced by [[Marcel Mauss]]'s ''The Gift'', as well as by Friedrich Nietzsche's ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]''.
