His 1913 work ''General Psychopathology'' influenced many later diagnostic criteria, and argued for a distinction between "primary" and "secondary" delusions. 

After being trained in and practising psychiatry, Jaspers turned to philosophical inquiry and attempted to develop an innovative [[philosophical system]]. He was often viewed as a major exponent of [[existentialism]] in Germany, though he did not accept the label.

== Life ==
[[File:Karl Jaspers 1910.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Karl Jaspers in 1910]]
Jaspers was born in [[Oldenburg (city)|Oldenburg]] in 1883 to a mother from a local farming community, and a [[jurist]] father. He showed an early interest in philosophy, but his father's experience with the legal system influenced his decision to study law at [[Heidelberg University]]. Jaspers first studied law in Heidelberg and later in [[University of Munich|Munich]] for three semesters. It soon became clear that Jaspers did not particularly enjoy law, and he switched to studying [[medicine]] in 1902 with a thesis about criminology. In 1910 he married Gertrud Mayer (1879–1974), the sister of his close friends [[Gustav Mayer]] and Ernst Mayer.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ers&AN=88801870&site=eds-live&scope=site|title=Karl Jaspers|last=Lewis|first=T.T.|date=2019|encyclopedia=Salem Press Biographical Encyclopedia|access-date=30 January 2020}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Jaspers earned his [[medical doctorate]] from the Heidelberg University [[medical school]] in 1908 and began work at a [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Heidelberg]] under [[Franz Nissl]], the successor of [[Emil Kraepelin]] and [[Bonhoeffer family|Karl Bonhoeffer]], and Karl Wilmans. Jaspers became dissatisfied with the way the medical community of the time approached the study of [[mental illness]] and gave himself the task of improving the psychiatric approach. In 1913 Jaspers habilitated at the philosophical faculty of the Heidelberg University and gained there in 1914 a post as a [[psychology]] teacher. The post later became a permanent philosophical one, and Jaspers never returned to clinical practice. During this time Jaspers was a close friend of the Weber family ([[Max Weber]] also having held a professorship at Heidelberg).<ref>Radkau, Joachim (1995). ''Max Weber: A Biography''. Polity Press. {{ISBN|978-0745683423}}. p. 29.</ref>

In 1921, at the age of 38, Jaspers turned from psychology to [[philosophy]], expanding on themes he had developed in his psychiatric works. He became a well-known philosopher across Germany and [[Europe]].

After the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933, Jaspers was considered to have a "Jewish taint" (''jüdische Versippung'', in the jargon of the time) due to his Jewish wife, Gertrude Mayer, and was forced to retire from teaching in 1937. In 1938 he fell under a publication ban as well. Many of his long-time friends stood by him, however, and he was able to continue his studies and research without being totally isolated. But he and his wife were under constant threat of removal to a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] until 30 March 1945, when Heidelberg was occupied by American troops.<ref>Wolfgang U. Eckart, Volker Sellin, Eike Wolgast: ''Die Universität Heidelberg im Nationalsozialismus.'' Springer-Verlag, 2006, p. 339.</ref>

In 1948 Jaspers moved to the [[University of Basel]] in [[Switzerland]].<ref name="SEP"/> In 1963 he was awarded the honorary citizenship of the city of Oldenburg in recognition of his outstanding scientific achievements and services to occidental culture.<ref>{{cite news |title=1963: Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.

== Contributions to psychiatry ==
Jaspers's dissatisfaction with the popular understanding of mental illness led him to question both the diagnostic criteria and the methods of clinical psychiatry. He published a paper in 1910 in which he addressed the problem of whether [[paranoia]] was an aspect of personality or the result of biological changes. Although it did not broach new ideas, this article introduced a rather unusual method of study, at least according to the norms then prevalent. Not unlike [[Freud]], Jaspers studied patients in detail, giving biographical information about the patients as well as notes on how the patients themselves felt about their symptoms. This has become known as the ''biographical method'' and now forms a mainstay of psychiatric and above all psychotherapeutic practice.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
[[File:Jaspers, Karl 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Karl Jaspers: ''Allgemeine Psychopathologie'', first print 1913]]

Jaspers set down his views on mental illness in a book which he published in 1913, ''General Psychopathology''.<ref name="SEP"/> This work has become a classic in the psychiatric literature and many modern diagnostic criteria stem from ideas found within it. One of Jaspers's central tenets was that psychiatrists should diagnose symptoms of mental illness (particularly of [[psychosis]]) by their ''form'' rather than by their ''content''. For example, in diagnosing a [[hallucination]], it is more important to note that a person experiences visual phenomena when no sensory stimuli account for them than to note what the patient sees. What the patient sees is the "content", but the discrepancy between visual perception and objective reality is the "form".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Jaspers thought that psychiatrists could diagnose [[delusion]]s in the same way. He argued that clinicians should not consider a belief delusional based on the content of the belief, but only based on the way in which a patient holds such a belief. (See [[delusion]] for further discussion.) Jaspers also distinguished between ''primary'' and ''secondary delusions''. He defined primary delusions as ''autochthonous'', meaning that they arise without apparent cause, appearing incomprehensible in terms of a normal mental process. (This is a slightly different use of the word ''autochthonous'' than the ordinary medical or sociological use as a synonym for indigenous.) Secondary delusions, on the other hand, he defined as those influenced by the person's background, current situation or mental state.

Jaspers considered primary delusions to be ultimately "un-understandable" since he believed no coherent reasoning process existed behind their formation. This view has caused some controversy, and the likes of [[R. D. Laing]] and [[Richard Bentall]] (1999, p.&nbsp;133–135) have criticised it, stressing that this stance can lead therapists into the complacency of assuming that because they do not understand a patient, the patient is deluded and further investigation on the part of the therapist will have no effect. For instance, Huub Engels (2009) argues that schizophrenic disordered speech may be understandable, just as [[Emil Kraepelin]]'s [[dream speech]] is understandable.

== Contributions to philosophy and theology ==
Most commentators associate Jaspers with the philosophy of [[existentialism]], in part because he draws largely upon the existentialist roots of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and in part because the theme of individual freedom permeates his work. In ''Philosophy'' (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and [[empiricism]], Jaspers points out that as people question [[reality]], they confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method simply cannot transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, or take a [[leap of faith]] toward what Jaspers calls ''[[Transcendence (religion)|Transcendence]]''. In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless [[freedom]], which Jaspers calls ''[[Dasein#Karl Jaspers' Dasein and Existenz|Existenz]]'', and can finally experience [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentic existence]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Transcendence (paired with the term ''The Encompassing'' in later works) is, for Jaspers, that which exists beyond the world of [[spacetime|time and space]]. Jaspers's formulation of Transcendence as ultimate non-objectivity (or no-thing-ness) has led many philosophers to argue that ultimately, Jaspers became a [[Monism|monist]], though Jaspers himself continually stressed the necessity of recognizing the validity of the concepts both of [[subjectivity]] and of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Although he rejected explicit religious doctrines,<ref name="SEP"/> including the notion of a personal God, Jaspers influenced contemporary theology through his philosophy of transcendence and the limits of human experience. [[Mystic Christianity|Mystic Christian]] traditions influenced Jaspers himself tremendously, particularly those of [[Meister Eckhart]] and of [[Nicholas of Cusa]]. He also took an active interest in [[Eastern philosophies]], particularly [[Buddhism]], and developed the theory of an [[Axial Age]], a period of substantial philosophical and religious development. Jaspers also entered public debates with [[Rudolf Bultmann]], wherein Jaspers roundly criticized Bultmann's "[[demythologizing]]" of Christianity.<ref name="SEP2">See ''Myth and Christianity: An Inquiry into the Possibility of Religion without Myth'' – a debate between Jaspers and Bultmann, The Noonday Press, New York, 1958.</ref>

Jaspers wrote extensively on the threat to human freedom posed by [[History of science#Modern science|modern science]] and modern [[economics|economic]] and [[politics|political]] institutions. During World War II, he had to abandon his teaching post because his wife was Jewish. After the war, he resumed his teaching position, and in his work ''The Question of German Guilt'' he unabashedly examined the culpability of Germany as a whole in the atrocities of [[Hitler]]'s [[Third Reich]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Celinscak|first=Mark|title=Distance from the Belsen Heap: Allied Forces and the Liberation of a Concentration Camp|year=2015|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-4426-1570-0}}</ref>

The following quote about the Second World War and its atrocities was used at the end of the sixth episode of the BBC documentary series ''[[The Nazis: A Warning from History]]'': "That which has happened is a warning. To forget it is guilt. It must be continually remembered. It was possible for this to happen, and it remains possible for it to happen again at any minute. Only in knowledge can it be prevented."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?p=5968 |title=The Nazis: A Warning from History |last=Jones |first=Ian |work=Off the Telly |date=26 August 2000 |access-date=10 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123215757/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?p=5968 |archive-date=23 November 2011}}</ref>

Jaspers's major works, lengthy and detailed, can seem daunting in their complexity. His last great attempt at a systematic philosophy of Existenz – ''Von der Wahrheit'' (On Truth) – has not yet appeared in English. However, he also wrote shorter works, most notably ''Philosophy Is for Everyman''. The two major proponents of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] [[hermeneutics]], namely [[Paul Ricœur]] (a student of Jaspers) and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] (Jaspers's successor at Heidelberg), both display Jaspers's influence in their works.<ref name="SEP" />

== Political views ==
Jaspers identified with the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[political philosophy]] of [[Max Weber]], although he rejected Weber's [[nationalism]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Schilpp |editor1-first=Paul Arthur |title=The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers |date=1977 |publisher=Open Court Publishing Company |pages=57–58}}</ref> He valued [[humanism]] and [[cosmopolitanism]] and, [[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|influenced]] by [[Immanuel Kant]], advocated an international federation of states with shared constitutions, laws, and international courts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=April |title=The Political Theory of Global Citizenship |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |pages=147–148}}</ref> He strongly opposed [[totalitarian]] [[despotism]] and warned about the increasing tendency towards [[technocracy]], or a regime that regards humans as mere instruments of science or of ideological goals. He was also sceptical of [[majoritarian]] democracy. Thus, he supported a form of governance that guaranteed individual freedom and [[limited government]], and shared Weber's belief that democracy needed to be guided by an [[intellectual]] [[elite]].<ref name="SEP">{{Citation |last1=Thornhill |first1=Chris |title=Karl Jaspers |date=2022 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2022/entries/jaspers/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Spring 2022 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=2022-07-16 |last2=Miron |first2=Ronny}}.</ref> His views were seen as [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Blanchot|first=Maurice|title="Apocalypse is disappointing."

== Influences ==
Jaspers held Kierkegaard and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] to be two of the most important figures in [[Immanuel Kant#Influence_and_legacy|post-Kantian philosophy]]. In his compilation, ''The Great Philosophers'' (''Die großen Philosophen''), he wrote: "I approach the presentation of Kierkegaard with some trepidation. Next to Nietzsche, or rather, prior to Nietzsche, I consider him to be the most important thinker of our post-Kantian age. With [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], an epoch had reached its conclusion, and our prevalent way of thinking – that is, the [[positivistic]], natural-scientific one – cannot really be considered as philosophy."<ref>Jaspers, Karl (1962). ''The Great Philosophers, Volume 4: The Disturbers: Descartes, Lessing, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche. Philosophers in Other Realms: Einstein, Weber, Marx.'' New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World. p. 191. {{ISBN|9780151369430}}.</ref> Jaspers also questions whether the two philosophers could be taught. For Kierkegaard, at least, Jaspers felt that Kierkegaard's whole method of [[Søren Kierkegaard#Authorship (1847–1855)|indirect communication]] precludes any attempts to properly expound his thought into any sort of systematic teaching.

Though Jaspers was certainly indebted to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, he also owes much to Kant and [[Plato]]. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] argues in ''From Shakespeare to Existentialism'' that, though Jaspers was certainly indebted to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, he was closest to Kant's philosophy:

<blockquote>Jaspers is too often seen as the heir of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard to whom he is in many ways less close than to Kant ... the Kantian antinomies and Kant's concern with the realm of decision, freedom, and faith have become exemplary for Jaspers. And even as Kant "had to do away with knowledge to make room for faith," Jaspers values Nietzsche in large measure because he thinks that Nietzsche did away with knowledge, thus making room for Jaspers' "philosophic faith".<ref>Kaufmann, Walter A. (1980) ''From Shakespeare to Existentialism: An Original Study'', Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0691013675}}. p. 285.</ref></blockquote>
In his essay "On My Philosophy", Jaspers states: "While I was still at school [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] was the first. Kant then became the philosopher for me and has remained so ... Nietzsche gained importance for me only late as the magnificent revelation of nihilism and the task of overcoming it."<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/jaspers.htm |last= Jaspers |first=Karl |title= On My Philosophy |date= 1941}}</ref> Jaspers is also indebted to his contemporaries, such as [[Heinrich Blücher]], from whom he borrowed the term, "the anti-political principle" to describe totalitarianism's destruction of a space of resistance.<ref>Hans Mommsen, "Interpretation of the Holocaust as a Challenge to Human Existence", in Arendt in Jerusalem, ed. Ascheim, p. 227.</ref>
