==Earlier life==
Peters was born in 1919 in [[Mussoorie]], [[British Raj|India]]. He spent his childhood with his grandmother in England. He was a pupil at [[Sidcot School]], [[Winscombe]], [[Somerset]], 1933–1938. As a young man, his private tutor was  Eric Blair (the writer [[George Orwell]]). As a [[conscientious objector]] in the [[Second World War]], he served in the [[Friends Ambulance Unit]] and with the [[Friends Relief Service]] in 1940–1944.

From his marriage in 1942 to Margaret Lee Duncan (1917–1998), elementary school teacher and daughter of Alfred Duncan, engineer, came one son and two daughters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ioe.ac.uk/services/693.html |title=PE – Richard Stanley Peters – Institute of Education, University of London |publisher=Ioe.ac.uk |date=19 January 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref>

==Academic career==
Peters studied at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], and received the Bachelor of Arts in 1942. In 1944 he began teaching Latin at Sidcot School. He became a part-time lecturer at [[Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]], where he also studied philosophy and psychology, receiving his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1949. From then to 1958 he was a full-time lecturer, moving on to be a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in philosophy until 1962. In 1961 he had a one-year guest professorship for education at [[Harvard University]]. In the following year he went to [[Australian National University]]. From 1962 until retirement in 1983, Peters was Professor of the Philosophy of Education at the Institute of Education (founded 1947) [[University of London]]. In 1971 he was Dean of the Institute. Under his guidance the Institute grew fast and considerably influenced the development of the philosophy of education in England. At the Institute Peters collaborated with Paul H. Hirst, who later became Professor of Education at [[King's College, London]], and then professor at [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk/ioe/cms/get.asp?cid=12449&12449_0=13056 |access-date=26 August 2023 |title= The Philosophy Section in Historical Perspective |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205706/http://ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk/ioe/cms/get.asp?cid=12449&12449_0=13056 |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}</ref>

==Influence on the philosophy of education==
Peters is known particularly for his work in the philosophy of education. However, his early writings were occupied with [[psychology]], more exactly with a philosophical view of psychological issues. Thus his research was in the areas motivation, emotions, personality as well as social behaviour and the relationship between reason and longing.<ref>Hirst, P. H.: "Richard Peters' contribution to the philosophy of education", in D. E. Cooper, ed.: ''Education, Values and Mind. Essays for R. S. Peters''. Routledge & Kegan Paul, London 1986, pp. 8–43.</ref>

Perhaps the most important work by Peters is ''Ethics and Education''.<ref>R. S. Peters: ''Ethics and Education'', 5th ed., George Allen & Unwin Ltd, London, 1968.</ref> With this and his subsequent publications he significantly influenced the development of the philosophy of education in Britain and worldwide. The influence resulted from his examination of the [[Definitions of education|concept of education]] in the sense of analytic philosophy, a central tool being term analysis. Peters explored two substantial aspects of the philosophy of education: the normative and the cognitive.
