'''John Selden''' (16 December 1584 – 30 November 1654) was an English [[jurist]], a scholar of England's ancient laws and constitution<ref>{{Citation |last= Pocock |first= John |title= The Ancient Constitution and the Feudal Law |place= Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year= 1957}}.</ref> and scholar of Jewish law.<ref>{{Citation |title= John Selden and Jewish Law |first= Isaac |last= Herzog |journal= Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law |series= 3 |volume= 13 |number= 4 |year= 1931 |pages= 236–45}}.</ref> He was known as a [[polymath]]; [[John Milton]] hailed Selden in 1644 as "the chief of learned men reputed in this land".<ref>{{Cite book |last= Milton |first=John |year=1644 |title= Areopagitica, A Speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing to the Parliament of England |place= London |edition= 1 |page= 11  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nejQAAAAMAAJ&q=areopagitica&pg=PP13  |access-date= 6 January 2017 |via= Google Books}}</ref><ref name= "naturall">{{cite web |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/areopagitica/index.shtml |title=Milton's ''Areopagitica'' |access-date=20 December 2007 |archive-date=24 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124233902/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/areopagitica/index.shtml |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Early life==

He was born at [[Salvington]], in the parish of [[Tarring, West Sussex|West Tarring]], West Sussex (now part of the town of [[Worthing]]), and was baptised at [[St Andrew's Church, West Tarring|St Andrew's]], the [[parish church]]. The cottage in which he was born survived until 1959 when it was destroyed by a fire caused by an electrical fault.<ref name="WAPH168">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1977|loc=§168.}}</ref>

His father, also named John Selden, had a small farm. It is said that his skill as a violin-player was what attracted his wife, Margaret, who was from a better family, being the only child of Thomas Baker of [[Rustington]] and descended from a knightly family of [[Kent]]. Selden was educated at the free grammar school at [[Chichester]], [[The Prebendal School]],<ref>{{Cite book |last=Haivry |first=Ofir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KNvFDgAAQBAJ|title=John Selden and the Western Political Tradition |date=2017-06-29 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-01134-2 |pages=11 |language=en}}</ref> and in 1600 he went on to [[Hertford College, Oxford|Hart Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. In 1603, he was admitted to [[Clifford's Inn]], London; in 1604 he moved to the [[Inner Temple]]; and in 1612 he was [[called to the bar]]. His earliest patron was Sir [[Robert Bruce Cotton]], the antiquary, who seems to have employed him to copy and summarise some of the parliamentary records then held at the [[Tower of London]]. For some reason, Selden very rarely practised in court, but his practice in [[barristers' chambers]] as a conveyancer and consulting counsel was large and apparently lucrative.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}}

==Legal scholar into politics==
[[File:John-Selden-David-Wilkins-Joannis-Seldeni-jurisconsulti-Opera omnia MG 0668.tif|thumb|Portrait of Selden (drawn by [[Peter Lely]]; engraved by [[George Vertue]]) included in the 1726 edition of his works]]
In 1618, his ''History of Tithes'' appeared. Although it had passed censorship and licensing, this dissertation on the historical basis of the [[tithe]] system caused anxiety among the bishops and provoked the intervention of the king, [[James VI and I|James I]]. The author was summoned before the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] and was compelled to retract his opinions.<ref>Berkowitz, p. 36.</ref> Also, his work was suppressed, and he was forbidden to reply to anyone who might come forward to answer it.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}}

This all seems to have caused Selden's entry into politics. Although he was not in the [[Parliament of England]], he was the instigator and perhaps the draughtsman of the [[Protestation of 1621]] on the rights and privileges of the House, affirmed by the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 18 December 1621. He and several others were imprisoned, at first in the Tower and later under the charge of Sir [[Robert Ducie]], [[sheriff of London]]. During his brief detention, he occupied himself in preparing an edition of medieval historian [[Eadmer]]'s ''History'' from a manuscript lent to him by his host or jailor, which he published two years afterwards.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}}

==Parliamentarian==
{{Marshalsea}}
In 1623 he was returned to the House of Commons for the [[borough]] of [[Lancaster (UK Parliament constituency)|Lancaster]], and sat with [[John Coke]], [[William Noy]] and [[John Pym]] on Sergeant Glanville's election committee. He was also nominated reader of [[Lyon's Inn]], an office he declined to undertake. For this the benchers of the Inner Temple fined him £20 and disqualified him from being one of their number. Nevertheless, after a few years, he became a master of the bench. In the first parliament of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1625), it appears from the "returns of members" printed in 1878 that contrary to the assertion of all his biographers, he had no seat. In Charles's second parliament (1626), he was elected for [[Great Bedwyn (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Bedwyn]] in Wiltshire, and took a prominent part in the impeachment of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]]. In the following year, in [[Darnell's Case]] (the Five Knights' Case), he was counsel for [[Sir Edmund Hampden]] in the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}}

In 1628 he was returned to the third parliament of Charles for [[Ludgershall (UK Parliament constituency)|Ludgershall]], Wiltshire, and was involved in drawing up and carrying the [[Petition of Right]]. In the session of 1629 he was one of the members responsible for the tumultuous passage in the House of Commons of the resolution against the illegal levy of [[tonnage]] and poundage, and, along with Sir [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]], Long, Valentine, [[William Strode]], and the rest, he was sent back to the Tower. There he remained for eight months, deprived for a part of the time of the use of books and writing materials. He was then removed, under less rigorous conditions, to the [[Marshalsea]], until [[William Laud|Archbishop Laud]] arranged for him to be freed. Some years before, he had been appointed [[Steward (office)|steward]] to [[Henry Grey, 8th Earl of Kent]], to whose seat, [[Wrest]] in Bedfordshire, he now retired.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}}

He was not elected to the [[Short Parliament]] of 1640; but to the [[Long Parliament]], summoned in the autumn, he was returned without opposition for [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University]]. He opposed the resolution against [[episcopacy]] which led to the exclusion of the bishops from the [[House of Lords]], and printed an answer to the arguments used by [[Sir Harbottle Grimston, 1st Baronet|Sir Harbottle Grimston]] on that occasion. He joined in the protestation of the Commons for the maintenance of the [[Protestant]] religion according to the doctrines of the [[Church of England]], the authority of the Crown, and the liberty of the subject. He was equally opposed to the court on the question of the commissions of lieutenancy of array and to the parliament on the question of the militia ordinance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}} In the end, he supported Parliament against King Charles, because, according to him, Charles was certainly acting illegally; but Selden was not certain if Parliament was doing the same.<ref>Glen Burgess, ''The Politics of the Ancient Constitution'' (1992), p. 95.</ref>

In 1643, he participated in the discussions of the [[Westminster Assembly]], where his [[Erastian]] views were opposed by [[George Gillespie]].<ref>Francis J. Bremer, Tom Webster. ''Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia'' (2006), p. 105.</ref> Selden's allies included [[Thomas Coleman]], [[John Lightfoot]], and [[Bulstrode Whitelocke]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/361/361-28.htm|title=The English Revolution, 1647–1649|last=Sommerville|first=Johann|publisher=University of Wisconsin|access-date=8 June 2016|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927053935/http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/361/361-28.htm|archive-date=27 September 2011}}</ref>

In October 1643, Selden was appointed by Commons to take control of the office of Clerk and Keeper of the Records in the Tower, which duty passed to the Master of the Rolls in 1651.<ref>{{cite book|title=Notes of Materials for the History of Public Departments| issue=1|date=1843|publisher=W. Clowes & Sons|last=Thomas|first=Francis Sheppard}}</ref> In 1645 he was named one of the parliamentary commissioners of the [[British Admiralty|admiralty]] and was elected master of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], an office that he declined to accept. In 1646, he subscribed to the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] and, in 1647, was voted £5000 by the parliament as compensation for his pains under the monarchy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}}

==Last years==

After the death of the [[Henry Grey, 8th Earl of Kent|Earl of Kent]] in 1639, Selden lived permanently under the same roof with the earl's widow, the former [[Elizabeth Grey, Countess of Kent|Elizabeth Talbot]]. It is believed that he married her, although their marriage does not seem to have ever been publicly acknowledged.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}} He assembled a famous library which eventually became part of the [[Bodleian Library]]'s collection in 1659.  In addition to a wide range of Greek, Arabic, Hebrew and Latin works, it included the [[Codex Mendoza]] and the [[Selden Map of China]].<ref>Robert Batchelor, ''London: The Selden Map and the Making of a Global City, 1549–1689'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2014), 128–151</ref>  He died at Friary House in [[Whitefriars, London|Whitefriars]], London on 30 November 1654, and was buried in the [[Temple Church]], London. His tomb is today clearly visible through glass plates in the floor of this church. Furthermore, he is commemorated by a monumental inscription on the south side of the Temple Church. More than two centuries after his death, in 1880, a brass tablet was erected to his memory by the benchers of the [[Inner Temple]] in the parish church of St. Andrew's, West Tarring.

[[File:John Selden and his table-talk (IA cu31924013123108).pdf|thumb|1899 edition of The Table Talk of John Selden by [[Robert Waters]] (1835 - 1910)]]
It was as a prolific scholar and writer that Selden won his reputation. The early books were on English history.

===English history and antiquities===

In 1610 three of his works came out: ''Jani Anglorum Facies Altera'' (''The Back Face'' [or ''Two Faces''] ''of the English [[Janus]]'') and ''England's Epinomis'',<ref>The ''[[Epinomis]]'' (Greek {{lang|el|Ἐπινομίς}}) is the name of one of [[Plato]]'s [[Socratic dialogue|dialogues]], which was an appendix to his ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' (Greek {{lang|el|Νόμοι}}, ''Nomoi''). Thus, the title ''England's Epinomis'' indicates that the work is an appendix to Selden's ''Jani Anglorum Facies Altera''.</ref> which dealt with the progress of English law down to [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]; and ''The Duello, or Single Combat'', in which he traced the history of [[trial by combat|trial by battle]] in England from the Norman Conquest. In 1613 he supplied a series of notes, including quotations and references, to the first eighteen [[canto]]s of [[Michael Drayton]]'s ''[[Poly-Olbion]]''. In 1614 he published ''Titles of Honor'', which, in spite of defects and omissions, remained a comprehensive work for centuries.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}} It was republished in a larger and greatly revised edition in 1631 and earned for Selden the praise "monarch of letters" from his friend [[Ben Jonson]].<ref>James Loxley, ''The Complete Critical Guide to Ben Jonson'' (2002), p. 100.</ref>

In 1615, the ''Analecton Anglobritannicon'', an account of the civil administration of England before the [[Norman Conquest]], written in 1607, was published; its title and argument imitated the ''Franco-Gallia'' of [[François Hotman]].<ref>Colin Kidd, ''British Identities Before Nationalism: Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600–1800'' (1999), p. 85.</ref> In 1616 appeared notes on [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]]'s ''De laudibus legum Angliae'' and [[Ralph de Hengham]]'s ''Summae magna et parva''.<ref>Michael Lapidge, Malcolm R. Godden, Simon Keynes, ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (2000), p. 250.</ref>

In 1618 his controversial ''History of Tithes'' was published. A first sign of the coming storm was the 1619 book controverting Selden, ''Sacrilege Sacredly Handled in two parts; with an Appendix, answering some objections'' by [[James Sempill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/nation/semple.htm|title=The Scottish Nation, Semple|publisher=electricscotland.com|access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref> Selden hit back, but was soon gagged. The churchmen [[Richard Tillesley]] (1582–1621) (''Animadversions upon M. Seldens History of Tithes'', 1619) and [[Richard Montagu]] (''Diatribae upon the first part of the late History of Tithes'', 1621) attacked the work.<ref>Charles John Sommerville, ''The Secularization of Early Modern England: From Religious Culture to Religious Faith'' (1992), p. 100.</ref> There were further replies by [[William Sclater (priest)|William Sclater]] (''The Quaestion of Tythes Revised'', 1623), and by [[Stephen Nettles]] (''Answer to the Jewish Part of Mr. Selden's History of Tithes'' 1625). In it Selden tried to demonstrate that tithing depended on the civil law, rather than [[canon law]]. He also made much of the complexities of the ancient Jewish customs on tithes.<ref>Adam Sutcliffe, ''Judaism and Enlightenment'' (2005), p. 47.</ref>
The work was also a milestone in the history of English historical writing through its mixture of [[antiquarian]]-philological scholarship with historical narrative, two approaches to the study of the past previously seen as distinct.

In 1623 he produced an edition of [[Eadmer]]'s ''Historia Novarum''. It was notable for including in appendices information from the ''[[Domesday Book]]'', which at the time had not been published and could only be consulted in the original at Westminster, on the payment of a fee.<ref>[[David C. Douglas]], ''English Scholars'' (1939), p. 171.</ref>

He published in 1642 ''Privileges of the Baronage of England when they sit in Parliament and Discourse concerning the Rights and Privileges of the Subject''. In 1652 he wrote a preface and collated some of the manuscripts for [[Roger Twysden|Sir Roger Twysden's]] ''Historiae Anglicanae scriptores X''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}}

===Literature and archaeology of the Near East===

In 1617, his ''De dis Syris'' was issued, and immediately established his fame as an orientalist. It is remarkable for its early use of the comparative method, on [[Semitic mythology]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}} Also, in 1642, he published a part of the Arabic chronicle of [[Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria]], under the title ''Eutychii Aegyptii, Patriarchae Orthodoxorum Alexandrini, ... ecclesiae suae origines''. Controversial was the discussion in it of the absence in Alexandria of the distinction between priests and bishops, a burning issue in the debate at the time in the [[Church of England]].<ref>David Armitage, ''British Political Thought in History, Literature and Theory, 1500–1800'' (2006), p. 57.</ref>

In 1628, at the suggestion of Sir Robert Cotton, Selden compiled, with the assistance of two other scholars, [[Patrick Young]] and [[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]], a catalogue of the [[Arundel marbles]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}}

===Studies on Judaism===

He employed his leisure at Wrest in writing ''De successionibus in bona defuncti secundum leges Ebraeorum'' and ''De successione in pontificatum Ebraeorum'', published in 1631.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}}

During the progress of the constitutional conflict, he was absorbed in research, publishing ''De jure naturali et gentium juxta disciplinam Ebraeorum'' in 1640.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=600–601}} It was a contribution to the theorising of the period on [[natural law]]. In the words of [[John Milton]], this "volume of naturall & national laws proves, not only by great authorities brought together, but by exquisite reasons and theorems almost mathematically demonstrative, that all opinions, yea errors, known, read, and collated, are of main service & assistance toward the speedy attainment of what is truest."<ref name="naturall"/><ref>{{Cite book |last=Milton |first=John |year=1644 |title= Areopagitica, A Speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing to the Parliament of England |place=London |edition= 1 |page=11  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nejQAAAAMAAJ&q=areopagitica&pg=PP13  |access-date=6 January 2017}} via Google Books</ref> It develops into a theory of [[international law]], taking as its basis the [[Seven Laws of Noah]].<ref>Mark W. Janis, ''Religion and International Law'' (1999), pp. 68–9.</ref>

In 1644, he published ''Dissertatio de anno civili et calendario reipublicae Judaicae'', in 1646 his treatise on marriage and divorce among the Jews entitled ''Uxor Ebraica'', and in 1647 the earliest printed edition of the old English law-book ''[[Fleta]]''. In 1650 Selden began to print the trilogy he planned on the [[Sanhedrin]], as the first part of ''De synedriis et prefecturis juridicis veterum Ebraeorum'' through the press, the second and third parts being severally published in 1653 and 1655.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}} The aim of this work was to counter the use by the Presbyterians, in particular, of arguments and precedents drawn from Jewish tradition; it was a very detailed study aimed at refuting such arguments, and pointing out the inherent flexibility of the tradition that was being cited.<ref>Johann Somerville, ''Hobbes, Selden, Erastianism and the history of the Jews'', pp. 168–9, in Graham Alan John Rogers, Tom Sorell, ''Hobbes and History'' (2000).</ref>

===International law===
[[File:John Selden from NPG (2) cleaned.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of John Selden held by the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]
His ''[[Mare clausum]]'' was written to dismantle the pretensions advanced by [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]] in ''[[The Free Sea]]'' (''Mare liberum''), on behalf of the Dutch fishermen, to poach in the waters off the English coasts.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}}

The circumstances of its delayed publication, in 1635, suggest that during the early 1630s Selden inclined towards the court rather than the popular party and even secured the personal favour of the king, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].    It had been written sixteen or seventeen years earlier, but for political reasons Charles's predecessor, [[James I of England|James I]], had prohibited its publication.  When it eventually appeared, a quarter of a century after ''Mare liberum'', it was under Charles's royal patronage, as a kind of state paper, and with a dedication to him.    The fact that Selden was not retained in the great case of [[ship money]] in 1637 by [[John Hampden]], the cousin of Sir Edmund, his former client in the Five Knights' Case, may be taken as additional evidence that his zeal for the popular cause was neither so warm nor so unquestioned as it had once been.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=600}}

His last publication was a vindication of himself from certain charges advanced against him and his ''Mare clausum'' around 1653 by [[Theodore Graswinckel]], a Dutch jurist.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}}

===Posthumous publications===

Several of Selden's minor works were printed for the first time after his death, including a tract in defence of the 25 December birth of Christ written during the Puritan Commonwealth (1649–1660) when celebration of Christmas was prohibited.<ref>Theanthropos: God Made Man, a Tract Proving the Nativity of our Saviour to be on the 25 December</ref> A collective edition of his writings was published by [[David Wilkins (archdeacon)|David Wilkins]] in 3 volumes folio in 1725, and again in 1726. ''Table Talk'', for which he is perhaps best known, did not appear until 1689. It was edited by his [[amanuensis]], [[Richard Milward (priest)|Richard Milward]], who affirms that "the sense and notion is wholly Selden's" and that "most of the words" are his also. Its genuineness has sometimes been questioned.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=601}}

==Views==

Selden arrived at an [[Erastian]] position in church politics. He also believed in [[free will]], which was inconsistent with [[Calvinism]].<ref>Steven Matthews, ''Theology and Science in the Thought of Francis Bacon'', pp. 125–8.</ref>

He was sceptical of the legend of [[King Arthur]] as it had grown up, but believed Arthur had existed.<ref>Rodney Castleden, ''King Arthur: The Truth Behind the Legend'' (2003), p. 49.</ref> The [[Druids]], he suggested in comments on ''Poly-Olbion'', were ancient and presumed esoteric thinkers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=OTHE00024&mode=normalized|title=Chapter 7: 'Much Greater, Than Commonly Imagined.'|last=Haycock|first=David Boyd|publisher=The Newton Project, University of Sussex|year=2013|access-date=8 June 2016|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226101259/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=OTHE00024&mode=normalized|archive-date=26 February 2009}}</ref> The popular image of a Druid descends via a masque of [[Inigo Jones]] from a reconstruction by Selden, based (without good foundations) on ancient German statuary.<ref>{{cite book|title=Blood & Mistletoe|first=Ronald|last=Hutton|date=2009|pages=62–4}}</ref>

==Commemoration==
[[File:Selden Soc vols.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Volumes published by the [[Selden Society]]]]
Selden is commemorated in the name of the [[Selden Society]], a [[learned society]] concerned with the study of English legal history, founded in 1887.

He is also commemorated in place-names in Salvington, including "The John Selden Inn", which purports to be on the site of his dwelling; Selden Road; and the Selden medical centre. Also The Selden Arms on Lyndhurst Road in Worthing.

==Influence==

According to the ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', he "played a role of fundamental importance in the transition of English historical writing from a medieval antiquarianism to a more modern understanding of the scope and function of history than had ever before been expressed in Renaissance England".<ref>Kelly Boyd, ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' (1999), p. 1082.</ref> His reputation lasted well, with [[Mark Pattison (academic)|Mark Pattison]] calling him "the most learned man, not only of his party, but of Englishmen".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/Milton2/#p52|last=Pattison|first=Mark|title=English Men of Letters, Ch. 8|date=1879}}</ref>

By about 1640, Selden's views (with those of Grotius) had a large impact on the [[Great Tew circle]] around [[Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland]]: [[William Chillingworth]], [[Dudley Digges]], [[Henry Hammond]].<ref>Richard Tuck, ''Philosophy and Government 1572–1651'' (1993), pp. 272–4.</ref> It was in this milieu that Selden met and befriended [[Thomas Hobbes]]. They had much in common, in political thought, but the precise connections have not been clarified.<ref>A. P. Martinich, ''The Two Gods of Leviathan: Thomas Hobbes on Religion and Politics'' (2003), p. 381.</ref>

[[Richard Cumberland (philosopher)|Richard Cumberland]] followed Selden over both Grotius and Hobbes on natural law. Selden contested the scholastic position, after [[Cicero]], that "right reason" could by its dictates alone generate [[moral obligation|obligation]], by claiming that a formal obligation required a superior in authority. In his ''De legibus'' Cumberland rejects Selden's solution by means of the Noahide laws, in ''De jure naturali'', in favour of Selden's less developed alternate solution. The latter is more orthodox for a [[Thomist]], an ''intellectus agens'' as a natural faculty in the rational soul, by the mediation of which divine intellect can intervene directly with individuals.<ref>Jon Parkin, ''Science, Religion and Politics in Restoration England: Richard Cumberland's De Legibus Naturae'' (1999), pp. 61–4.</ref> [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]] tried to merge the theory of Grotius on property with Selden's view on obligation.<ref>Richard Tuck, ''Natural Rights Theories: Their Origin and Development'' (1981), p. 162.</ref> Cumberland and Hale both belonged to a larger group, followers in a broad sense of Selden, with backgrounds mostly of Cambridge and the law, comprising also [[#Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 1st Baronet, of Great Lever|Orlando Bridgeman]], [[Hezekiah Burton]], [[John Hollings]], [[Richard Kidder]], [[Edward Stillingfleet]], [[John Tillotson]], and [[John Wilkins]].<ref>Jon Parkin, ''Science, Religion and Politics in Restoration England: Richard Cumberland's De Legibus Naturae'' (1999), pp. 26–8.</ref>

[[Giambattista Vico]] called Grotius, Selden and [[Samuel Pufendorf]] the "three princes" of the "natural right of the gentes". He went on to criticise their approach foundationally.<ref>Thomas Goddard Bergin and Max Harold Fisch (translators), ''The New Science of Giambattista Vico'' (1970 edition), section 493 at p. 123; translation revised by replacing "law" with a faithful rendering of "''diritto''" as "right".</ref> In his ''Autobiography'' he specifies that they had conflated the natural law of the "nations", based on custom, with that of the philosophers, based on human abstractions.<ref>Thomas Goddard Bergin and Max Harold Fisch (translators), ''The Autobiography of Giambattista Vico'' (1975 edition), p. 172.</ref> [[Isaiah Berlin]] comments on Vico's admiration for Grotius and Selden.<ref>[[Isaiah Berlin]], ''Against the Current'' (1997 edition), p. 118.</ref>

By the time of his death in 1654, Selden had accumulated a library of several thousand manuscripts and printed books. Selden's will left his intentions for this library somewhat ambiguous, although the will and [[Codicil (will)|codicil]] seem to suggest that he intended to bequeath most of his [[Orient]]al manuscripts, Greek manuscripts, a Latin manuscript, and his printed [[Talmud]]ic and [[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinical]] books to the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barratt|first=D. M.|date=1950–1951|title=The Library of John Selden and its later history|journal=The Bodleian Library Record|volume=3|pages=129}}</ref> There is some evidence to suggest that Selden intended to leave his printed books and historical manuscripts to the [[Inner Temple]] but that this transaction did not occur because the Temple did not possess a large enough library.<ref>Barratt, D.

The Bodleian agreed, and the library received Selden's collection in June 1659.<ref>Barratt, D. M. (1950–51). "The Library of John Selden and its later history". ''The Bodleian Library Record''.

Selden's collection was the largest received by the Bodleian in the seventeenth century, comprising around 8,000 items.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=The Bodleian Library|title=Rare Books Named Collection Descriptions|url=https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/weston/finding-resources/catalogues/rare_books_named_collections/rare_books_named_collection_descriptions#Selden|website=Weston Library}}</ref> Even this massive collection did not represent the extent of Selden's library. Duplicates, meaning books the library already owned, were given to [[Gloucester Cathedral]] library.<ref name=":0" /> A rumor also circulated in the decades after Selden's death that part of his library had remained in London and was destroyed by a fire. The 1704 edition of [[Edward Chamberlayne]]'s ''The Present State of England'' claimed that a fire at the Inner Temple destroyed "8 Chests full" of Selden's manuscripts.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chamberlayne|first=Edward|title=Angliae Notitia: Or The Present State of England|year=1704|edition=21|location=London|pages=465}}</ref> Still, the collection the Bodleian received was large enough that it required several years and multiple librarians to fully catalogue.<ref>Barratt, D. M. (1950–51). "The Library of John Selden and its later history". ''The Bodleian Library Record''. '''3''': 133.</ref> Since then, the original collection has been enhanced by further acquisitions, most notably by a group of forty Selden manuscripts purchased by the Bodleian from James Fairhurst in 1947.<ref>Barratt, D.

The Selden collection at the Bodleian houses more than 400 manuscript volumes taking up more than 40 meters (approx. 130 feet) of shelf space.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bodleian Archives & Manuscripts|title=Manuscripts of John Selden|url=https://archives.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/repositories/2/resources/7560}}</ref><ref>All information about Selden's manuscripts taken from the Bodleian Library's Summary Catalogues: Madan, Falconer and H. H. E. Craster. 1922. ''A Summary Catalogue of Western Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library at Oxford''. Vol. 2. Oxford University Press. Also Clapinson, Mary and T. D. Rogers, ''Summary Catalogue of Post-Medieval Western Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library Oxford''. Vol. 2.

Some manuscripts touch on contemporary events. For instance MS. Arch. Selden B. 8 includes a Latin speech given in Oxford on the return of [[Spanish match|Prince Charles from Spain in 1623]]. Still others contain classical works of philosophy and literature, such as

* Treatises of Aristotle (MS. Selden Supra 24)
* [[Aeschylus]] and [[Lycophron]] (MS. Selden Supra 18)
Beyond manuscripts, the Selden collection contains several notable printed works. Among them is the first book ever printed in Japan using moveable type, ''Sanctos no gosagueo no uchi nuqigaqi'' (Arch.b.f.69).<ref name=":1" /> The printed books included in the Selden collection contain many that are significant in part because they originated in the libraries of other famous figures, including [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Cotton]], [[John Donne]], and [[John Dee]].<ref name=":1" /> According to [[Geoffrey Keynes]], several of the books Selden received from John Donne's library include inscriptions from both men. One such book is [[Theodore Beza|Theodorus Beza]]'s ''Tractatio de polygamia'', which includes Donne's signature and motto ("Per Rachel ho servitor, & non per Lea"), as well as Selden's motto ("περί παντός τήν έλευθερίαν", "Freedom above all things").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Keynes|first=Geoffrey|title=A Bibliography of John Donne|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1958|pages=210}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Bodleian Library|date=24 June 2010|title='Freedom above all things': A display of John Selden's books at the Bodleian Library|url=https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/news/2010/2010_jun_24#:~:text=Inspired%20by%20his%20motto%20'Freedom,anniversary%20of%20Selden's%20first%20publications.}}</ref>
