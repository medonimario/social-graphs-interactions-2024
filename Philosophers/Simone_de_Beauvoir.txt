Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiographies, and monographs on philosophy, politics, and social issues. She was best known for her "trailblazing work in feminist philosophy",<ref name=":0">{{cite book | chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/ | title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | chapter=Simone de Beauvoir | year=2023 | publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University }}</ref> ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949), a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]]. She was also known for her novels, the most famous of which were ''[[She Came to Stay]]'' (1943) and ''[[The Mandarins]]'' (1954). 

Her most enduring contribution to literature are her memoirs, notably the first volume, ''Mémoires d'une jeune fille rangée''<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mémoires d'une jeune fille rangée - Simone de Beauvoir |url=https://www.babelio.com/livres/Beauvoir-Memoires-dune-jeune-fille-rangee/1364335 |access-date=2023-03-02 |website=Babelio |language=fr}}</ref> (1958).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11814265|title=Oxford illustrated encyclopedia|date=1985–1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Judge, Harry George., Toyne, Anthony.|isbn=0-19-869129-7|location=Oxford [England]|pages=40|oclc=11814265}}</ref> She received the 1954 [[Prix Goncourt]], the 1975 [[Jerusalem Prize]], and the 1978 [[Austrian State Prize for European Literature]].

She and her long-time lover, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], along with numerous other French intellectuals, campaigned for the release of people convicted of child sex offenses and signed a petition which advocated [[French petition against age of consent laws|the abolition of age of consent laws in France]].<ref name="Henley">{{cite news |author=Henley, Jon |date=23 February 2001 |title=Calls for legal child sex rebound on luminaries of May 68 |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/24/jonhenley |access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>

==Personal life==

=== Early years ===
Beauvoir was born on 9 January 1908,<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2020/01/09/UPI-Almanac-for-Thursday-Jan-9-2020/6871578415895/|title= UPI Almanac for Thursday, Jan. 9, 2020|work= [[United Press International]] | date= 9 January 2020|access-date=16 January 2020 |archive-date= 15 January 2020|archive-url= https://archive.today/20200115192229/https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2020/01/09/UPI-Almanac-for-Thursday-Jan-9-2020/6871578415895/|url-status=live|quote=...French novelist Simone de Beauvoir in 1908}}</ref> into a [[bourgeois]] [[Paris]]ian family in the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jun/06/classics.simonedebeauvoir |title=Still the second sex|first=Maureen|last=Freely|author-link=Maureen Freely|date=6 June 1999|access-date=6 January 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=UK|archive-date=13 April 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190413171557/https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jun/06/classics.simonedebeauvoir| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/08/top10s.debeauvoir |title=Lisa Appignanesi's top 10 books by and about Simone de Beauvoir|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=8 January 2008|access-date=6 January 2019|archive-date=13 April 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190413154026/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/08/top10s.debeauvoir|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118617/anne-hollander-reviews-simone-de-beauvoir-biography-deidre-bair |title=The Open Marriage of True Minds|first=Anne|last=Hollander|date=11 June 1990|magazine=[[The New Republic]]|access-date=6 January 2019|archive-date=12 September 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150912233548/https://newrepublic.com/article/118617/anne-hollander-reviews-simone-de-beauvoir-biography-deidre-bair|url-status=live}}</ref> Her parents were Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir, a lawyer who once aspired to be an actor,<ref name = "IEP Biography">Mussett, Shannon. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/#H1 Simone de Beauvoir Biography on the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]. Retrieved 11 April 2010.</ref> and Françoise Beauvoir (née Brasseur), a wealthy banker's daughter and devout [[Catholic]]. Simone had a sister, [[Hélène de Beauvoir|Hélène]], who was born two years later, on June 6, 1910. The family struggled to maintain their bourgeois status after losing much of their fortune shortly after [[World War I]], and Françoise insisted the two daughters be sent to a prestigious convent school.

Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fueled by her father's encouragement; he reportedly would boast, "Simone thinks like a man!"<ref>Bair, p. 60</ref> Because of her family's straitened circumstances, she could no longer rely on her [[dowry]], and like other middle-class girls of her age, her marriage opportunities were put at risk. She took this opportunity to take steps towards earning a living for herself.<ref name="oxfordreference.com">{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195148909.001.0001/acref-9780195148909-e-90|isbn = 978-0-19-514890-9|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia Women in World History|chapter = Beauvoir, Simone de|date = January 2008|publisher = Oxford University Press| doi=10.1093/acref/9780195148909.001.0001 }}</ref>

She first worked with [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in preparation for the ''[[agrégation]]'' in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination that serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for it that she met ''École Normale'' students [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Paul Nizan]], and [[René Maheu]] (who gave her the lasting nickname "''Castor''", or "beaver").<ref name = "IEP Biography" /> The jury for the ''agrégation'' narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam.<ref>Menand, Louis. [http://www.newYorker.com/archive/2005/09/26/050926crbo_books?currentPage=all "Stand By Your Man"]. ''The New Yorker'', 26 September 2005. Retrieved 11 May 2010.</ref> Additionally, Beauvoir finished an exam for the certificate of "General Philosophy and Logic" second to [[Simone Weil]]. Her success as the eighth woman to pass the ''agrégation'' solidified her economic independence and furthered her feminist ideology.<ref name=":0" />

Writing of her youth in ''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter,'' she said:
"...my father's individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother's teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual."<ref>''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter'', Book One</ref>

==== Education ====
Beauvoir pursued post-secondary education after completing her high school years at {{Interlanguage link multi|Cours Desir|fr}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Paris: sur les traces de Simone de Beauvoir |trans-title=Paris: On the trail of Simone de Beauvoir |url= https://www.en-vols.com/inspirations/culture/paris-simone-de-beauvoir/ |website=en-vols.com |date=22 November 2022 |access-date=31 July 2023 |language=fr}}</ref> After passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy at the age of seventeen in 1925, she studied mathematics at the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]] and literature/languages at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut Sainte-Marie|fr}}. She then studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and after completing her degree in 1928, wrote her ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Diplôme d'Études Supérieures Spécialisées|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] thesis) on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] for [[Léon Brunschvicg]] (the topic was "Le concept chez Leibniz" ["The Concept in Leibniz"]).<ref>Margaret A. Simons (ed.), ''Feminist Interpretations of Simone de Beauvoir'', Penn State Press, 1 November 2010, p. 3.</ref> Her studies of political philosophy through university influenced her to start thinking of societal concerns.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

==== Religious upbringing ====
Beauvoir was raised in a Catholic household. In her youth, she was sent to convent schools. She was deeply religious as a child, at one point intending to become a nun. At age 14, Beauvoir questioned her faith as she saw many changes in the world after witnessing tragedies throughout her life.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|title=Simone de Beauvoir|url=https://www.biography.com/scholar/simone-de-beauvoir|access-date=2021-03-04|website=Biography|date=9 July 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref> Consequently, she abandoned her faith in her early teens and remained an [[atheism|atheist]] for the rest of her life.<ref name="Thurman">Thurman, Judith. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/books/excerpt-introduction-second-sex.html Introduction to Simone de Beauvoir's ''The Second Sex'']. Excerpt published in ''The New York Times'' 27 May 2010. Retrieved 11 April 2010.</ref> To explain her atheist beliefs, Beauvoir stated, "Faith allows an evasion of those difficulties which the atheist confronts honestly. And to crown all, the believer derives a sense of great superiority from this very cowardice itself."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bertrand de Beauvoir|first=Simone|title=All Said and Done|publisher=G. P.

=== Middle years ===
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir at the Balzac Memorial]]
From 1929 through 1943, Beauvoir taught at the [[lycée]] level until she could support herself solely on the earnings of her writings. She taught at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Montgrand|fr}} ([[Marseille]]), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Jeanne-d'Arc (Rouen)|fr}}, and the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Molière (Paris)|fr}} (1936–39).<ref>Kelly Oliver (ed.), ''French Feminism Reader'', Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2000, p. 1; ''Bulletin 2006 de l'Association amicale des anciens et anciennes élèves du lycée Molière'', 2006, p. 22.</ref>

During the trial of [[Robert Brasillach]] Beauvoir was among a small number of prominent intellectuals advocating for his execution for 'intellectual crimes'. She defended this decision in her 1946 essay "An Eye for an Eye".<ref>David Newcastle, [https://tikhanovlibrary.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-pierre-drieu-la-rochelle/ ''The Rise and Fall of Pierre Drieu la Rochlle''], Gilles, Tikhanov Library, 2024, preface</ref><ref>[https://academic.oup.com/book/11006/chapter-abstract/159332034?redirectedFrom=fulltext “An Eye for an Eye”: The Question of Revenge] Sonia Kirks</ref>

==== Jean-Paul Sartre ====
Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre met during her college years. Intrigued by her determination as an educator, he intended to make their relationship romantic. However, she had no interest in doing so.<ref name="auto" /> She later changed her mind, and in October 1929, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and Beauvoir became a couple for the next 51 years, until his death in 1980.<ref>Seymour-Jones 2008, back cover.</ref> After they were confronted by her father, Sartre asked her to marry him on a provisional basis. One day while they were sitting on a bench outside the Louvre, he said, "Let's sign a two-year lease".<ref>Bair, p. 155-7</ref> Though Beauvoir wrote, "Marriage was impossible. I had no dowry", scholars point out that her ideal relationships described in ''The Second Sex'' and elsewhere bore little resemblance to the marriage standards of the day.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=Julie K. |title=Reciprocity and Friendship in Beauvoir's Thought |journal=Hypatia |date=November 1999 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=36–49 |doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1999.tb01251.x|s2cid=146561354 }}</ref>
<blockquote>I think marriage is a very alienating institution, for men as well as for women. I think it's a very dangerous institution—dangerous for men, who find themselves trapped, saddled with a wife and children to support; dangerous for women, who aren't financially independent and end up by depending on men who can throw them out when they are 40; and very dangerous for children, because their parents vent all their frustrations and mutual hatred on them. The very words 'conjugal rights' are dreadful. Any institution which solders one person to another, obliging people to sleep together who no longer want to is a bad one.<ref>{{Cite news|title=A talk with Simone de Beauvoir |date=2 June 1974 |last=Moorehead |first=Caroline |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/02/archives/a-talk-with-simone-de-beauvoirr-marriage-is-an-alienating.html |access-date=30 August 2023}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Instead, she and Sartre entered into a lifelong "soul partnership", which was sexual but not exclusive, nor did it involve living together.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/10/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Lisa | last=Appignanesi | title=Our relationship was the greatest achievement of my life | date=10 June 2005}}</ref> She chose never to marry and never had children.

A scholar who was lecturing with her<ref>Beauvoir, ''The Prime of Life,'' p. 363.</ref> chastised their "distinguished [Harvard] audience [because] every question asked about Sartre concerned his work, while all those asked about Beauvoir concerned her personal life."<ref>Thurman, Judith. Introduction to ''The Second Sex'', 2009.</ref>

Sartre and Beauvoir always read each other's work. Debate continues about the extent to which they influenced each other in their existentialist works, such as Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' and Beauvoir's ''She Came to Stay'' and "Phenomenology and Intent".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Kate|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1097366004|title=Becoming Beauvoir: A Life|date=22 August 2019|isbn=978-1-350-04717-4|location=London|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|oclc=1097366004}}</ref> However, recent studies of Beauvoir's work focus on influences other than Sartre, including [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]] and Leibniz.<ref name="SEP-Bergoffen-2010" /> The [[Neo-Hegelianism|Neo-Hegelian]] revival led by [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Jean Hyppolite]] in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Sartre, to discover Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.<ref>Ursula Tidd, ''Simone de Beauvoir'', Psychology Press, p. 19.</ref><ref>Nancy Bauer, ''Simone de Beauvoir: Philosophy, and Feminism'', Columbia University Press, 2012, p. 86.</ref>  However, Beauvoir, reading Hegel in German during the war, produced an original critique of his dialectic of consciousness.

==== Allegations of sexual abuse ====
Beauvoir was [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and her relationships with young women were controversial.<ref name="Lise1">{{cite book |author=Rodgers |title=Philosophers Behaving Badly |author2=Thompson |publisher=London: [[Peter Owen Publishers]] |year=2004 |isbn=072061368X |pages=186–187 |author-link1=Nigel Rodgers |author-link2=Mel Thompson (writer)}}</ref> French author [[Bianca Lamblin]] (originally Bianca Bienenfeld) wrote in her book ''Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée'' (Memoirs of a deranged girl, published in English under the title ''A Disgraceful Affair'') that, while a student at Lycée Molière, she was sexually exploited by her teacher Beauvoir, who was in her 30s.<ref>''Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée'' (1994, LGF – Livre de Poche; {{ISBN|978-2-253-13593-7}}/2006, Balland; {{ISBN|978-2-7158-0994-9}}).</ref> Sartre and Beauvoir both groomed and sexually abused Lamblin.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Riding |first1=Alan |date=14 April 1996 |title=The Odd Couple |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/14/books/the-odd-couple.html |access-date=9 November 2021 |website=New York Times |quote=Beauvoir duly seduced her and, the following year, introduced her to Sartre, then 33, who also took her to bed.

Natalie Sorokine, along with Bianca Lamblin and [[Olga Kosakiewicz]], later stated that their relationships with de Beauvoir damaged them psychologically.<ref name="Lise1" />

[[File:President Nasser-Sagan-Sartre.jpg|thumb|[[Egypt|Egypt's]] President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], Beauvoir, [[Sartre]] in Cairo, 1967.]]

Beauvoir wrote popular travel diaries about time spent in the United States<ref>de Beauvoir, "America Day by Day", Carol Cosman (Translator) and Douglas Brinkley (Foreword), Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. {{ISBN|9780520210677}}.</ref> and China and published essays and fiction rigorously, especially throughout the 1950s and 1960s.

She published several volumes of short stories, including ''The Woman Destroyed'', which, like some of her other later work, deals with aging.

When Beauvoir visited Algren in Chicago, [[Art Shay]] took well-known nude and portrait photos of Beauvoir. Shay also wrote a play based on Algren, Beauvoir, and Sartre's triangular relationship. The play was stage read in 1999 in Chicago.

Beauvoir also wrote a four-volume autobiography, consisting of ''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter'', ''The Prime of Life'', ''Force of Circumstance'' (sometimes published in two volumes in English translation: ''After the War'' and ''Hard Times''), and ''All Said and Done''.<ref name="iep.utm.edu" /> In 1964 Beauvoir published a novella-length autobiography, ''A Very Easy Death'', covering the time she spent visiting her aging mother, who was dying of cancer.

Her 1970 long essay [[La Vieillesse]] (''The Coming of Age'') is a rare instance of an intellectual meditation on the decline and solitude all humans experience if they do not die before about the age of 60.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Woodward |first=Kathleen |date=1993 |title=Simone de Beauvoir: Prospects for the Future of Older Women |journal=Generations |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=23}}</ref>

In the 1970s Beauvoir became active in France's [[women's liberation movement]]. She wrote and signed the [[Manifesto of the 343]] in 1971, a manifesto that included a list of famous women who claimed to have had an abortion, then illegal in France. Signatories were diverse{{clarify|date=February 2019}} as [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Delphine Seyrig]], and Beauvoir's sister Hélène. In 1974, abortion was legalized in France.

When asked in a 1975 interview with [[Betty Friedan]] if she would support a minimum wage for women who do housework, Beauvoir answered: "No, we don’t believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorized to stay at home and raise her children. Society should be different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one. It is a way of forcing women in a certain direction", further stating that motherhood "should be a choice, and not a result of conditioning”.<ref>"Sex, Society, and the Female Dilemma".

In 1981 she wrote ''La Cérémonie des adieux'' (''A Farewell to Sartre''), a painful account of Sartre's last years. In the opening of ''Adieux'', Beauvoir notes that it is the only major published work of hers which Sartre did not read before its publication.{{cn|date=February 2024}}|

She contributed the piece "Feminism - Alive, Well, and in Constant Danger" to the 1984 anthology ''[[Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology]]'', edited by [[Robin Morgan]].<ref name="global">{{cite web |title=Table of Contents: Sisterhood is global |url=https://catalog.vsc.edu/lscfind/Record/154795/TOC#tabnav |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208065459/https://catalog.vsc.edu/lscfind/Record/154795/TOC#tabnav |archive-date=8 December 2015 |access-date=2015-10-15 |publisher=Catalog.vsc.edu}}</ref>

After Sartre died in 1980, Beauvoir published his letters to her with edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After Beauvoir's death, Sartre's adopted daughter and literary heir [[Arlette Elkaïm-Sartre|Arlette Elkaïm]] would not let many of Sartre's letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartre's letters available today have Beauvoir's edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. Beauvoir's adopted daughter and literary heir [[Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir|Sylvie Le Bon]], unlike Elkaïm, published Beauvoir's unedited letters to both Sartre and Algren.

==== Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir ====
[[Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir]] and Simone de Beauvoir met in the 1960s, when Beauvoir was in her fifties and Sylvie was a teenager. In 1980, Beauvoir, 72, legally adopted Sylvie, who was in her late thirties, by which point they had already been in an intimate relationship for decades. Although Beauvoir rejected the institution of marriage her entire life, this adoption was like a marriage for her. Some scholars argue that this adoption was not to secure a literary heir for Beauvoir, but as a form of resistance to the bio-heteronormative family unit.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Latchford |first=Frances J. |date=2020 |title=Heterodox Love and the Girl Maverick: Simone de Beauvoir, Sylvie le Bon, and Their Confounding Family Romance |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/782290 |journal=Adoption & Culture |language=en |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=194–209 |doi=10.1353/ado.2020.0009 |s2cid=232040473 |issn=2574-2523}}</ref>

==''The Second Sex''==
[[File:Le deuxième sexe.jpg|thumb|''[[The Second Sex]]'']]''[[The Second Sex]]'', first published in 1949 in French as ''Le Deuxième Sexe'', turns the existentialist mantra that ''[[existence precedes essence]]'' into a feminist one: "One is not born but becomes a woman" (French: "On ne naît pas femme, on le devient").<ref>Beauvoir, ''The Second Sex'', 267.</ref> With this famous phrase, Beauvoir first articulated what has come to be known as the [[sex-gender distinction]], that is, the distinction between biological sex and the social and historical construction of gender and its attendant stereotypes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mikkola |first=Mari |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/feminism-gender/ |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=3 January 2018 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |chapter=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender |via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Beauvoir argues that "the fundamental source of women's oppression is its [femininity's] historical and social construction as the quintessential" Other.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bergoffen |first=Debra |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/beauvoir/ |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2015 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Fall 2015}}</ref>

Beauvoir defines women as the "second sex" because women are defined as inferior to men. She pointed out that [[Aristotle]] argued women are "female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities", while [[Thomas Aquinas]] referred to women as "imperfect men" and the "incidental" being.<ref name="marxists.org">{{cite web |last=Beauvoir |first=Simone de |title=Simone de Beauvoir The Second Sex, Woman as Other 1949 |url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/de-beauvoir/2nd-sex/introduction.htm |website=marxists.org}}</ref> She quotes "In itself, homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality: the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man; either, a human being, without feeling fear, restraint, or obligation."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Beauvoir |first=Simone |title=The Second Sex}}</ref>

Beauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men, and thus can choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond the "[[immanence]]" to which they were previously resigned and reaching "[[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]", a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world, where one chooses one's freedom.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Beauvoir, Simone de |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/907794335 |title=The second sex |date=2 March 2015 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-09-959573-1 |oclc=907794335}}</ref>

Chapters of ''The Second Sex'' were originally published in ''Les Temps modernes'',<ref>Appignanesi 2005, p. 82</ref> in June 1949. The second volume came a few months after the first in France.<ref>Appignanesi 2005, p. 89</ref> It was published soon after in America due to the quick translation by [[Howard Parshley]], as prompted by [[Blanche Knopf]], wife of publisher [[Alfred A. Knopf Sr.|Alfred A. Knopf]]. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a professor of biology at [[Smith College]]), much of Beauvoir's book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message.<ref name="Moi, Toril 2002">Moi, Toril "While We Wait: The English Translation of 'The Second Sex'" in ''Signs'' 27(4) (Summer, 2002), pp. 1005–35.</ref> For years, Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of Beauvoir's work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars.<ref name="Moi, Toril 2002" />

Only in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.<ref>{{cite web |title=Review: The Second Sex, by Simone de Beauvoir |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/books/review-the-second-sex-by-simone-de-beauvoir/article1615327 |via=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>

Women's Press, Toronto 2004 p.&nbsp;59–65.</ref> Beauvoir argued that men had made women the "Other" in society by the application of a false aura of "mystery" around them. She argued that men used this as an excuse not to understand women or their problems and not to help them, and that this stereotyping was always done in societies by the group higher in the hierarchy to the group lower in the hierarchy. She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity, such as race, class, and religion, but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it as an excuse to organize society into a [[patriarchy]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Despite her contributions to the feminist movement, especially the French women's liberation movement, and her beliefs in women's economic independence and equal education, Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist.<ref name="oxfordreference.com" /> However, after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist revolution]] to be enough to bring about women's liberation. She publicly declared herself a feminist in 1972 in an interview with ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fallaize |first=Elizabeth |title=Simone de Beauvoir: A critical reader |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |isbn=978-0415147033 |edition=Digital print |location=London |page=6}}</ref>

==Other notable works==

===''She Came to Stay''===
{{Main|She Came to Stay}}

Beauvoir published her first novel ''She Came to Stay'' in 1943.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/|title=Beauvoir, Simone de {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref> It has been assumed that it is inspired by her and Sartre's sexual relationship with [[Olga Kosakiewicz]] and [[Wanda Kosakiewicz]]. Olga was one of her students in the Rouen secondary school where Beauvoir taught during the early 1930s. She grew fond of Olga. Sartre tried to pursue Olga but she rejected him, so he began a relationship with her sister Wanda. Upon his death, Sartre was still supporting Wanda. He also supported Olga for years, until she met and married [[Jacques-Laurent Bost]], a lover of Beauvoir. However, the main thrust of the novel is philosophical, a scene in which to situate Beauvoir's abiding philosophical pre-occupation – the relationship between the self and the other.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

In the novel, set just before the outbreak of [[World War II]], Beauvoir creates one character from the complex relationships of Olga and Wanda. The fictionalised versions of Beauvoir and Sartre have a [[ménage à trois]] with the young woman. The novel also delves into Beauvoir and Sartre's complex relationship and how it was affected by the ménage à trois.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

''She Came to Stay'' was followed by many others, including ''[[The Blood of Others]]'', which explores the nature of individual responsibility, telling a love story between two young French students participating in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] in World War II.<ref name="iep.utm.edu">{{Cite web |title=Beauvoir, Simone de {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=https://iep.utm.edu/simone-de-beauvoir/ |access-date=2022-07-20 |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Existentialist ethics===
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir & Jean-Paul Sartre in Beijing 1955.jpg|thumb|Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre in [[Beijing]], 1955]]

In 1944, Beauvoir wrote her first philosophical essay, ''Pyrrhus et Cinéas'', a discussion on existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay ''[[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]'' (1947); it is perhaps the most accessible entry into [[Existentialism|French existentialism]]. In the essay, Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, have found in major existentialist works such as ''Being and Nothingness''. In ''The Ethics of Ambiguity'', Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.<ref name="SEP-Bergoffen-2010" />

===''Les Temps Modernes''===

Beauvoir remained an editor until her death. However, [[Sartre]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] had a longstanding feud, which led Merleau-Ponty to leave ''Les Temps modernes''. Beauvoir sided with Sartre and ceased to associate with Merleau-Ponty.

Algren was outraged by the frank way Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both ''The Mandarins'' and her autobiographies.<ref name="lrb_rogin" /> Algren vented his outrage when reviewing American translations of Beauvoir's work.

In Paris, [[Place Jean-Paul-Sartre-et-Simone-de-Beauvoir]] is a square where Beauvoir's legacy lives on. It is one of the few squares in Paris to be officially named after a couple. The pair lived close to the square at 42 [[rue Bonaparte]].
