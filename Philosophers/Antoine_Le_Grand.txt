'''Antoine Le Grand''' ({{IPA|fr|ɑ̃twan lə ɡʁɑ̃}}; 1629 in [[Douai]]{{spaced ndash}}1699 in [[London]]) was a French [[Recollect]] and [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] philosopher.

==Life==
Born in [[Douai]], [[Spanish Netherlands]], he was attached at an early age to the English community of St. Bonaventure's convent there, and became a Franciscan Recollect friar, and taught philosophy and divinity. Sent on the English mission, he resided for many years in [[Oxfordshire]], and in 1695 he was tutor in the family of Henry Fermor of [[Tusmore, Oxfordshire|Tusmore]]. His advocacy of Cartesianism met with strong resistance from [[Samuel Parker (English bishop)|Samuel Parker]], who would become [[bishop of Oxford]].<ref>s.v. 'Le Grand, Antoine' in the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.</ref> Towards the close of his life he engaged in sharp controversies on metaphysical topics with [[John Sergeant (priest)|John Sergeant]], a secular priest. At the twenty-third chapter of his order, assembled in London on 9 July 1693, he was elected provincial, and he held that office till his death on 9 August 1699.<ref>{{cite book| author = Vere Claiborne Chappell| title = Cartesian philosophers| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4zHlAAAAMAAJ| year = 1992| publisher = Garland| isbn = 978-0-8153-0577-4| page = 309 }}</ref>

Le Grand argued against [[animal rights]] and authored ''Dissertatio de carentia sensus et cognitionis in brutis'' (On the Lack of Sense and Cognition in Brutes) in 1675 which defends the Cartesian idea that animals are mere machines.<ref>Grayling, A. C; Pyle, Andrew; Goulder, Naomi. (2006). ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of British Philosophy: K-Q''. Thoemmes Continuum. p. 1848</ref><ref>Hellerstedt, Andreas. (2022).

''Nordic Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies''. Retrieved 22 November 2022.</ref>

Le Grand authored ''An Entire Body of Philosophy'' in 1694 which reduced Cartesianism to a "scholastic" scheme. It has been described as the last major exposition of Cartesianism which heralded the close of the Cartesian era.<ref>Watson, R. A. (2012) ''The Downfall of Cartesianism 1673–1712: A Study of Epistemological Issues in Late 17th Century Cartesianism''. Springer. p. 81. {{ISBN|9789401029629}}</ref> He lived a studious and retired life. He is noted for the effort he made to render the approach of Descartes more apparently [[school|scholastic]], to improve its reception with traditionalists.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legrand/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Antoine le Grand|year=2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref>
