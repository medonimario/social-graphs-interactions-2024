'''Wang Bi''' ({{lang-zh|王弼}}; 226–249), [[courtesy name]] '''Fusi''' ({{lang-zh|輔嗣}}), was a Chinese philosopher and politician. During his brief career he produced commentaries on the [[Tao Te Ching]] and [[I Ching]] which were highly influential in [[Chinese philosophy]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Wang Bi|url=https://iep.utm.edu/wangbi/ |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=2023-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Wang Bi |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wang-Bi |access-date=2023-07-21 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>

==Life==
Wang Bi served as a minor bureaucrat in the state of [[Cao Wei]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period. He died from an [[epidemic]] at the age of 23.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Theobald |first=Ulrich |title=Wang Bi 王弼 (www.chinaknowledge.de) |url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Division/personswangbi.html |access-date=2023-07-21 |website=www.chinaknowledge.de |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Wagner |first=Rudolf G. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3DvtkuXRfBsC |title=The Craft of a Chinese Commentator: Wang Bi on the Laozi |date=2000-01-06 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-4395-8 |pages=20 |language=en}}</ref>

Wang Bi's most important works are commentaries on [[Laozi]]'s ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' and the ''[[I Ching]]''. The text of the ''Tao Te Ching'' that appeared with his commentary was widely considered the best copy of this work until the discovery of the Han-era [[Mawangdui]] texts in 1973. He was a scholar of [[Xuanxue]].

== Writings ==
At least three works by Wang Bi are known: a commentary on [[Confucius]]' ''[[Analects]]'', which survives only in quotations; commentaries on the ''[[I Ching]]'' and the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', which not only have survived but have greatly influenced subsequent Chinese thought on those two classics.

His commentary on the ''I Ching'' has been translated into English by Richard John Lynn, ''The Classic of Changes'' (New York: Columbia University, 1994) {{ISBN|0-231-08295-9}}

Several translations into English have been made of his commentary of the ''Tao Te Ching'':
