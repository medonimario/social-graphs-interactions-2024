Luther was ordained to the [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priesthood]] in 1507. He came to reject several teachings and practices of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]; in particular, he disputed the view on [[indulgence]]s. Luther attempted to resolve these differences amicably, first proposing an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'', which he authored in 1517. In 1520, [[Pope Leo X]] demanded that Luther renounce all of his writings, and when Luther refused to do so, [[Excommunication in the Catholic Church|excommunicated]] him in January 1521. Later that year, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] condemned Luther as an outlaw at the [[Diet of Worms]]. When Luther died in 1546, Pope Leo X's excommunication was still in effect.

Luther taught that [[Salvation in Christianity#Lutheranism|salvation]] and, consequently, [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] are not earned by good deeds; rather, they are received only as the free gift of God's [[Divine grace#Grace in the Protestant Reformation|grace]] through the believer's [[Faith in Christianity#Lutheranism|faith]] in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]], who is the sole redeemer from sin. [[Theology of Martin Luther|Luther's theology]] challenged the authority and office of the pope by teaching that the [[Bible#Christian Bibles|Bible]] is the [[sola scriptura|only source]] of [[revelation|divinely revealed]] knowledge,<ref>Ewald M. Plass, ''What Luther Says'', 3 vols., (St. Louis: CPH, 1959), 88, no. 269; M.

Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1958, 40:18 ff.</ref> Those who identify Luther's wider teachings are called Lutherans, though Luther opposed the name, believing that those who professed faith in Christ should be called "Christian" or "Evangelic".

[[Luther Bible|Luther's translation of the Bible]] into [[German language|German]] from [[Renaissance Latin|Latin]] made the Bible vastly more accessible to the laity, which had a tremendous impact on both the church and German culture. It fostered the development of a standard version of the [[German language#Modern German|German language]], added several principles to the art of translation,<ref>Fahlbusch, Erwin and Bromiley, Geoffrey William.

In 1523, Luther wrote that Jesus Christ was born a Jew which discouraged mistreatment of the Jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the [[Old Testament]] could be shown to speak of Jesus Christ. However, as the Reformation grew, Luther began to lose hope in large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity, and in the years his health deteriorated he grew more acerbic toward the Jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists, [[Zwingli]], and the [[Reformation Papacy|pope]].</ref> These works also targeted [[Roman Catholic]]s, [[Anabaptism#Zwickau prophets and the German Peasants' War|Anabaptists]], and [[Nontrinitarianism#Following the Reformation|nontrinitarian Christians]].<ref>Schaff, Philip: ''History of the Christian Church, Vol. VIII: Modern Christianity: The Swiss Reformation'', William B.

Martin Luther was born on 10 November 1483 to Hans Luder (or Ludher, later Luther)<ref name=Marty1>[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 1.</ref> and his wife Margarethe (née Lindemann) in [[Eisleben]], [[House of Mansfeld|County of Mansfeld]], in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Luther was [[Baptism|baptized]] the next morning on the feast day of [[Martin of Tours]].

In 1484, his family moved to [[Mansfeld]], where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters<ref name=Brecht3>[[Martin Brecht|Brecht, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 1:3–5.</ref> and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council; in 1492, he was elected as a town councilor.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Martin-Luther | title=Martin Luther &#124; Biography, Reformation, Works, & Facts| date=17 May 2023}}</ref><ref name=Marty1/> The religious scholar [[Martin E. Marty|Martin Marty]] describes Luther's mother as a hard-working woman of "trading-class stock and middling means", contrary to Luther's enemies, who labeled her a whore and bath attendant.<ref name=Marty1/>

He had several brothers and sisters and is known to have been close to one of them, Jacob.<ref name=Marty3>[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 3.</ref>

===Education===
Hans Luther, Martin's father, was ambitious for himself and his family. He was determined to see Martin, his eldest son, become a lawyer. He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld, then [[Magdeburg]] in 1497, where he attended the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], a school operated by a [[laity|lay group]], and [[Eisenach]] in 1498.<ref name=RuppEB>[[Gordon Rupp|Rupp, Ernst Gordon]]. "Martin Luther," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', accessed 2006.</ref> The three schools focused on the so-called "[[trivium]]": grammar, rhetoric, and logic. Luther later compared his education there to [[purgatory]] and [[hell]].<ref name=Marty2>[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, pp. 2–3.</ref>

In 1501, at age 17, Martin entered the [[University of Erfurt]], which he later described as a beerhouse and whorehouse.<ref name=Marty4>[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 4.</ref> He was made to awaken at 4 a.m. for "a day of rote learning and often wearying spiritual exercises."<ref name=Marty4/> He received his master's degree in 1505.<ref name=Marty5>[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 5.</ref>

In accordance with his father's wishes, Luther enrolled in law but dropped out almost immediately, believing that law was an uncertain profession.<ref name=Marty5/> Luther instead sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing interest in [[Aristotle]], [[William of Ockham]], and [[Gabriel Biel]].<ref name=Marty5/> He was deeply influenced by two tutors, [[Bartholomaeus Arnoldi]] von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers<ref name=Marty5/> and to test everything himself by experience.<ref name=Marty6>[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 6.</ref>

Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying to Luther because it offered assurance about the use of [[reason]] but none about loving [[God]], which Luther believed was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, Luther felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over Aristotle's emphasis on reason.<ref name=Marty6/> For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Human beings could learn about God only through divine [[revelation]], he believed, leading him to view [[Religious text|scripture]] as increasingly important.<ref name=Marty6/>

On 2 July 1505, while Luther was returning to university on horseback following a trip home, a [[lightning]] bolt struck near him during a thunderstorm. He later told his father that he was terrified of death and divine judgment, and he cried out, "Help! [[Saint Anne|Saint Anna]], I will become a monk!"<ref name=Brecht48>Brecht, Martin.

Luther dedicated himself to the [[Rule of Saint Augustine|Augustinian order]], devoting himself to [[fasting]], long hours in [[prayer]], [[pilgrimage]], and frequent [[Confession (religion)|confession]].<ref name=Bainton40>Bainton, Roland.

Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Publishing House, 1986, 79.</ref>

[[Johann von Staupitz]], his superior, concluded that Luther needed more work to distract him from excessive introspection and ordered him to pursue an academic career. On 3 April 1507, Jerome Schultz, the [[Prince-Bishopric of Brandenburg|Bishop of Brandenburg]], ordained Luther in [[Erfurt Cathedral]].

The following year, in 1508, Luther began teaching [[theology]] at the [[University of Wittenberg]].<ref name=Bainton44>Bainton, Roland. ''Here I Stand: a Life of Martin Luther''.

In 1515, he was made provincial [[vicar]] of [[Saxony]] and [[Thuringia]], which required him to visit and oversee eleven monasteries in his province.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hendrix |first=Scott H. |year=2015 |title=Martin Luther: Visionary Reformer |place=New Haven, CT |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-16669-9 |page=45}}</ref>

===Lectures on Psalms and justification by faith===
{{Main|Sola fide}}
[[File:Luther at Erfurt - Justification by Faith.jpg|thumb|upright|''Luther at Erfurt'', an 1861 portrait by [[Joseph Noel Paton]] depicting Luther discovering the doctrine of ''[[sola fide]]'' (by faith alone)]]
From 1510 to 1520, Luther lectured on the Psalms, and on the books of Hebrews, Romans, and Galatians. As he studied these portions of the Bible, he came to view the use of terms such as [[penance]] and [[righteousness]] by the Catholic Church in new ways. He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity. The most important for Luther was the doctrine of [[justification (theology)|justification]]—God's act of declaring a sinner righteous—by faith alone through God's grace. He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God's [[Divine grace|grace]], attainable only through faith in Jesus as the [[Messiah]].<ref name=Wriedt>Wriedt, Markus. "Luther's Theology," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Luther''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003, 88–94.</ref> "This one and firm rock, which we call the doctrine of justification", he writes, "is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine, which comprehends the understanding of all godliness."<ref>Bouman, Herbert J.A. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090403013639/http://www.quodlibet.net/articles/dorman-luther.shtml "The Doctrine of Justification in the Lutheran Confessions"], ''Concordia Theological Monthly'', 26 November 1955, No. 11:801.</ref>

Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God. This teaching by Luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]]'', which was written in response to ''[[Works of Erasmus#On Free Will (1524)|On Free Will]]'' by [[Erasmus|Desiderius Erasmus]] (1524). Luther based his position on [[predestination]] on St. Paul's epistle to the {{bibleverse||Ephesians|2:8–10|NKJV}}. Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in {{em|cooperation}} with God, Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually {{em|is}} the righteousness of Christ, imputed to Christians (rather than infused into them) through faith.<ref>Dorman, Ted M., "[https://web.archive.org/web/20090403013639/http://www.quodlibet.net/articles/dorman-luther.shtml Justification as Healing: The Little-Known Luther"], ''Quodlibet Journal'': Volume 2 Number 3, Summer 2000. Retrieved 13 July 2007.</ref>

His entry into Paradise, no less, was a discovery about "the righteousness of God"—a discovery that "the just person" of whom the Bible speaks (as in Romans 1:17) lives by faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=155|title=Justification by Faith: The Lutheran-Catholic Convergence|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615015903/http://religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=155|archive-date=15 June 2010}}</ref> He explains his concept of "justification" in the [[Smalcald Articles]]:

<blockquote>
The first and chief article is this: Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, died for our sins and was raised again for our justification (Romans 3:24–25). He alone is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world ([[Gospel of John|John]] 1:29), and God has laid on Him the iniquity of us all ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 53:6). All have sinned and are justified freely, without their own works and merits, by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, in His blood (Romans 3:23–25). This is necessary to believe. This cannot be otherwise acquired or grasped by any work, law, or merit. Therefore, it is clear and certain that this faith alone justifies us&nbsp;... Nothing of this article can be yielded or surrendered, even though heaven and earth and everything else falls ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 13:31).<ref>Luther, Martin.

In 1516, [[Johann Tetzel]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]], was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money in order to rebuild [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome.<ref>"[[Johann Tetzel]]," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007</ref> Tetzel's experiences as a preacher of indulgences, especially between 1503 and 1510, led to his appointment as general commissioner by [[Albert of Brandenburg|Albrecht von Brandenburg, Archbishop of Mainz]], who, already deeply in debt to pay for a large accumulation of benefices, had to contribute the considerable sum of ten thousand [[ducat]]s<ref>At first, "the pope demanded twelve thousand ducats for the twelve apostles. Albert offered seven thousand ducats for the seven deadly sins. They compromised on ten thousand, presumably not for the Ten Commandments". Bainton, Roland.

Albrecht obtained permission from Pope Leo&nbsp;X to conduct the sale of a special plenary indulgence (i.e., remission of the temporal punishment of sin), half of the proceeds of which Albrecht was to claim to pay the fees of his benefices.

On 31 October 1517, Luther wrote to his bishop, Albrecht von Brandenburg, protesting against the sale of indulgences. He enclosed in his letter a copy of his "Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences",{{efn|name=title|{{langx|la|"Disputatio pro declaratione virtutis indulgentiarum"}} – The first printings of the ''Theses'' use an [[incipit]] rather than a title which summarizes the content. Luther usually called them "{{lang|de|meine Propositiones}}" (my propositions).{{sfn|Cummings|2002|p=32}}}} which came to be known as the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]''. Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices, and the tone of the writing is accordingly "searching, rather than doctrinaire."<ref name=HillerbrandIndulgences>Hillerbrand, Hans J. "Martin Luther: Indulgences and salvation," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007.</ref> Hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses, particularly in Thesis 86, which asks: "Why does the pope, whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]], build the basilica of St. Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money?"<ref name=HillerbrandIndulgences/>

Luther objected to a saying attributed to Tetzel that, "As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory (also attested as 'into heaven') springs."<ref>Thesis 55 of Tetzel's ''One Hundred and Six Theses''. These "Anti-theses" were a reply to Luther's ''Ninety-five Theses'' and were drawn up by Tetzel's friend and former professor, [[Konrad Wimpina]]. Theses 55 & 56 (responding to Luther's 27th Thesis) read: "For a soul to fly out, is for it to obtain the vision of God, which can be ''hindered by no interruption'', therefore he errs who says that the soul ''cannot fly out'' before the coin can jingle in the bottom of the chest." In ''The reformation in Germany'', [[Henry Clay Vedder]], 1914, Macmillan Company, p. 405.

Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 1:204–205.</ref> Within two weeks, copies of the theses had spread throughout Germany. Luther's writings circulated widely, reaching [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], and [[History of Italy|Italy]] as early as 1519. Students thronged to Wittenberg to hear Luther speak. He published a short commentary on [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] and his ''Work on the Psalms''. This early part of Luther's career was one of his most creative and productive.<ref>Spitz, Lewis W. ''The Renaissance and Reformation Movements'', St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1987, 338.</ref> Three of his best-known works were published in 1520: ''[[To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation]]'', ''[[On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church]]'', and ''[[On the Freedom of a Christian]]''.

Archbishop Albrecht did not reply to Luther's letter containing the ''Ninety-five Theses''. He had the theses checked for heresy and in December 1517 forwarded them to Rome.<ref>Michael A. Mullett, ''Martin Luther'', London: [[Routledge]], 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-415-26168-5}}, 78; Oberman, Heiko, ''Luther: Man Between God and the Devil'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-300-10313-1}}, 192–193.</ref> He needed the revenue from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his [[Benefice#Pluralism|tenure of more than one bishopric]]. As Luther later notes, "the pope had a finger in the pie as well, because one half was to go to the building of St. Peter's Church in Rome".<ref>Mullett, 68–69; Oberman, 189.</ref>

Pope Leo X was used to reformers and heretics,<ref>Richard Marius, ''Luther'', London: Quartet, 1975, {{ISBN|0-7043-3192-6}}, 85.</ref> and he responded slowly, "with great care as is proper."<ref>Papal Bull ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'', 15 June 1520.</ref> Over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against Luther, which served only to harden the reformer's anti-papal theology. First, the Dominican theologian [[Sylvester Mazzolini]] drafted a heresy case against Luther, whom Leo then summoned to Rome.

In January 1519, at [[Altenburg]] in Saxony, the papal nuncio [[Karl von Miltitz]] adopted a more conciliatory approach. Luther made certain concessions to the Saxon, who was a relative of the Elector and promised to remain silent if his opponents did.<ref>Mullett, 92–95; Roland H.

===Excommunication===
On 15 June 1520, the Pope warned Luther with the [[papal bull]] (edict) ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' that he risked [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)#History|excommunication]] unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings, including the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'', within 60 days. That autumn, Eck proclaimed the bull in [[Meissen]] and other towns. Von Miltitz attempted to broker a solution, but Luther, who had sent the pope a copy of ''On the Freedom of a Christian'' in October, publicly set fire to the bull and [[decretal]]s in Wittenberg on 10 December 1520,<ref name="Hillerbrand463">Brecht, Martin. (tr. Wolfgang Katenz) "Luther, Martin," in Hillerbrand, Hans J. (ed.) ''Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation''.

Luther was excommunicated by Pope {{nowrap|Leo X}} on 3 January 1521, in the bull ''[[Decet Romanum Pontificem]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=From Babylon to Eternity: The Exile Remembered and Constructed in Text and Tradition|first1=Bob|last1=Becking|first2=Alex|last2=Cannegieter|first3=Wilfred|last3=van er Poll|publisher=Routledge|page=91|year=2016|isbn=978-1-134-90386-3}}</ref> And although the [[Lutheran World Federation]], Methodists and the Catholic Church's [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] agreed (in 1999 and 2006, respectively) on a "common understanding of justification by God's grace through faith in Christ," the Catholic Church has never lifted the 1521 excommunication.<ref>Wooden, Cindy.

===Diet of Worms (1521)===
{{Main|Diet of Worms}}
[[File:Luther at the Diet of Worms.jpg|thumb|''Luther Before the Diet of Worms'', an 1877 portrait by [[Anton von Werner]]]]
[[File:Martin-Luther-Denkmal, Worms.JPG|thumb|[[Luther Monument (Worms)|Luther Monument in Worms]], a statue of Luther surrounded by the figures of his lay protectors and earlier Church reformers, including [[John Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus]], and [[Girolamo Savonarola]]]]
The enforcement of the ban on the ''Ninety-five Theses'' fell to the secular authorities. On 17 April 1521, Luther appeared as ordered before the [[Diet of Worms]]. This was a general assembly of the estates of the Holy Roman Empire that took place in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], a town on the [[Rhine]]. It was conducted from 28 January to 25 May 1521, with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles&nbsp;V]] presiding. Prince [[Frederick&nbsp;III, Elector of Saxony]], obtained a [[safe conduct]] for Luther to and from the meeting.

Johann Eck, speaking on behalf of the empire as assistant of the [[Richard von Greiffenklau zu Vollrads|Archbishop of Trier]], presented Luther with copies of his writings laid out on a table and asked him if the books were his and whether he stood by their contents. Luther confirmed he was their author but requested time to think about the answer to the second question. He prayed, consulted friends, and gave his response the next day:

<blockquote>
Unless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear reason (for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone, since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted, and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. May God help me. Amen.<ref>Brecht, 1:460.</ref>
</blockquote>

At the end of this speech, Luther raised his arm "in the traditional salute of a knight winning a bout." Michael Mullett considers this speech as a "world classic of epoch-making oratory."<ref name=mullettp25>Mullett (1986), p. 25</ref>

Eck informed Luther that he was acting like a heretic, saying,
<blockquote>Martin, there is no one of the heresies which have torn the bosom of the church, which has not derived its origin from the various interpretation of the Scripture. The Bible itself is the arsenal whence each innovator has drawn his deceptive arguments. It was with Biblical texts that [[Pelagius]] and [[Arius]] maintained their doctrines. Arius, for instance, found the negation of the eternity of the Word—an eternity which you admit, in this verse of the New Testament—''Joseph knew not his wife till she had brought forth her first-born son''; and he said, in the same way that you say, that this passage enchained him. When the fathers of the [[Council of Constance]] condemned this proposition of Jan Hus—''The church of Jesus Christ is only the community of the elect'', they condemned an error; for the church, like a good mother, embraces within her arms all who bear the name of Christian, all who are called to enjoy the celestial beatitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/luther/lutherbyluther.html#secondnarrative|title=Life of Luther (Luther by Martin Luther)|first=Martin|last=Luther}}</ref></blockquote>

Luther refused to recant his writings. He is sometimes also quoted as saying: "Here I stand. I can do no other". Recent scholars consider the evidence for these words to be unreliable since they were inserted before "May God help me" only in later versions of the speech and not recorded in witness accounts of the proceedings.<ref>Wilson, 153, 170; Marius, 155.</ref> However, Mullett suggests that given his nature, "we are free to believe that Luther would tend to select the more dramatic form of words."<ref name=mullettp25/>

Over the next five days, private conferences were held to determine Luther's fate. The emperor presented the final draft of the [[Edict of Worms]] on 25 May 1521, declaring Luther an [[Outlaw#In other countries|outlaw]], banning his literature, and requiring his arrest: "We want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic."<ref>Bratcher, Dennis. "[http://www.crivoice.org/creededictworms.html The Diet of Worms (1521)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003172831/http://www.crivoice.org/creededictworms.html |date=3 October 2017 }}," in ''The Voice: Biblical and Theological Resources for Growing Christians''. Retrieved 13 July 2007.</ref> It also made it a crime for anyone in Germany to give Luther food or shelter. It permitted anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence.

Luther's disappearance during his return to Wittenberg was planned. {{nowrap|Frederick III}} had him intercepted on his way home in the forest near Wittenberg by masked horsemen impersonating highway robbers. They escorted Luther to the security of the [[Wartburg|Wartburg Castle]] at [[Eisenach]].<ref>''Reformation Europe: 1517–1559,'' London: Fontana, 1963, 53; [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], ''Reformation: Europe's House Divided, 1490–1700,'' London: Allen Lane, 2003, 132.</ref> During his stay at Wartburg, which he referred to as "my [[John of Patmos|Patmos]]",<ref>Luther, Martin.

On 1 August 1521, Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme: "Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong, but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world.

In the summer of 1521, Luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of Church practice. In ''On the Abrogation of the Private Mass'', he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice, asserting instead that it is a gift, to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation.<ref>Brecht, 2:27–29; Mullett, 133.</ref> His essay ''On Confession, Whether the Pope has the Power to Require It'' rejected compulsory [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and encouraged private confession and [[Absolution#Lutheran Churches|absolution]], since "every Christian is a confessor."<ref>Brecht, 2:18–21.</ref> In November, Luther wrote ''The Judgement of Martin Luther on Monastic Vows''. He assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin, because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation.<ref>Marius, 163–164.</ref>

[[File:Lucas Cranach d.Ä. - Bildnis Luthers als Junker Jörg (Leipzig).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Luther disguised as "[[Junker]] Jörg" in 1521]]
Luther made his pronouncements from Wartburg in the context of rapid developments at Wittenberg, of which he was kept fully informed. Andreas Karlstadt, supported by the ex-Augustinian [[Gabriel Zwilling]], embarked on a radical programme of reform there in June 1521, exceeding anything envisaged by Luther. The reforms provoked disturbances, including a revolt by the Augustinian friars against their prior, the smashing of statues and images in churches, and denunciations of the magistracy. After secretly visiting Wittenberg in early December 1521, Luther wrote ''A Sincere Admonition by Martin Luther to All Christians to Guard Against Insurrection and Rebellion''.<ref>Mullett, 135–136.</ref> Wittenberg became even more volatile after Christmas when a band of visionary zealots, the so-called [[Zwickau prophets]], arrived, preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man,{{clarify|date=May 2018}} [[Believer's baptism|adult baptism]], and Christ's imminent return.<ref>Wilson, 192–202; Brecht, 2:34–38.</ref> When the town council asked Luther to return, he decided it was his duty to act.<ref>Bainton, Mentor edition, 164–165.</ref>

{{See also|Radical Reformation|German Peasants' War}}
[[File:Wittenberg Lutherhaus.JPG|thumb|[[Lutherhaus]], Luther's residence in [[Wittenberg]]]]
Luther secretly returned to [[Wittenberg]] on 6 March 1522. He wrote to the Elector: "During my absence, Satan has entered my sheepfold, and committed ravages which I cannot repair by writing, but only by my personal presence and living word."<ref>Letter of 7 March 1522.

In these sermons, he hammered home the primacy of core [[Christian values#New Testament teaching|Christian values]] such as love, patience, charity, and freedom, and reminded the citizens to trust God's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change.<ref>Brecht, 2:60; Bainton, Mentor edition, 165; Marius, 168–169.</ref>

<blockquote>Do you know what the Devil thinks when he sees men use violence to propagate the gospel? He sits with folded arms behind the fire of hell and says with malignant looks and frightful grin: "Ah, how wise these madmen are to play my game! Let them go on; I shall reap the benefit. I delight in it." But when he sees the Word running and contending alone on the battle-field, then he shudders and shakes for fear.<ref name="Schaff IV">Schaff, Philip, [http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/history/7_ch04.htm ''History of the Christian Church, Vol VII, Ch IV''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823185716/http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/history/7_ch04.htm |date=23 August 2017 }}.</ref></blockquote>

The effect of Luther's intervention was immediate. After the sixth sermon, the Wittenberg jurist Jerome Schurf wrote to the elector: "Oh, what joy has Dr. Martin's return spread among us! His words, through divine mercy, are bringing back every day misguided people into the way of the truth."<ref name="Schaff IV" />

Luther next set about reversing or modifying the new church practices. By working alongside the authorities to restore public order, he signaled his reinvention as a conservative force within the Reformation.<ref>Marius, 169.</ref> After banishing the Zwickau prophets, he faced a battle against both the established Church and the radical reformers who threatened the new order by fomenting social unrest and violence.<ref>Mullett, 141–43.</ref>

[[File:Titelblatt 12 Artikel.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twelve Articles]]'' of peasants' demands, issued in 1525]]
Despite his victory in Wittenberg, Luther was unable to stifle radicalism further afield. Preachers such as [[Thomas Müntzer]] and Zwickau prophet [[Nicholas Storch]] found support amongst poorer townspeople and peasants between 1521 and 1525. There had been [[Popular revolts in late-medieval Europe|revolts by the peasantry]] on smaller scales since the 15th century.<ref>Michael Hughes, ''Early Modern Germany: 1477–1806'', London: Macmillan, 1992, {{ISBN|0-333-53774-2}}, 45.</ref> Luther's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy, often worded with "liberal" phraseology, led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general.<ref>A.G. Dickens, ''The German Nation and Martin Luther'', London: Edward Arnold, 1974, {{ISBN|0-7131-5700-3}}, 132–133. Dickens cites as an example of Luther's "liberal" phraseology: "Therefore I declare that neither pope nor bishop nor any other person has the right to impose a syllable of law upon a Christian man without his own consent".</ref> Revolts broke out in [[Franconia]], [[Swabia]], and [[Thuringia]] in 1524, even drawing support from disaffected nobles, many of whom were in debt. Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as Müntzer in Thuringia, and Hipler and Lotzer in the south-west, the revolts turned into war.<ref>Hughes, 45–47.</ref>

Luther sympathised with some of the peasants' grievances, as he showed in his response to the [[Twelve Articles]] in May 1525, but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities.<ref>Hughes, 50.</ref> During a tour of Thuringia, he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents, monasteries, bishops' palaces, and libraries. In ''[[Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants]]'', written on his return to Wittenberg, he gave his interpretation of the Gospel teaching on wealth, condemned the violence as the devil's work, and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs:

<blockquote>
Therefore let everyone who can, smite, slay, and stab, secretly or openly, remembering that nothing can be more poisonous, hurtful, or devilish than a rebel ... For baptism does not make men free in body and property, but in soul; and the gospel does not make goods common, except in the case of those who, of their own [[Free will in theology#Lutheranism|free will]], do what the apostles and disciples did in Acts 4 [:32–37]. They did not demand, as do our insane peasants in their raging, that the goods of others—of Pilate and Herod—should be common, but only their own goods. Our peasants, however, want to make the goods of other men common, and keep their own for themselves. Fine Christians they are! I think there is not a devil left in hell; they have all gone into the peasants. Their raving has gone beyond all measure.<ref>Jaroslav J. Pelikan, Hilton C. Oswald, ''Luther's Works'', 55 vols. (St. Louis and Philadelphia: Concordia Pub. House and Fortress Press, 1955–1986), 46: 50–51.</ref>
</blockquote>

Luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds. First, in choosing violence over lawful submission to the secular government, they were ignoring Christ's counsel to "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's"; St. Paul had written in his epistle to the {{bibleverse||Romans|13:1–7|NKJV}} that all authorities are appointed by God and therefore should not be resisted. This reference from the Bible forms the foundation for the doctrine known as the [[divine right of kings]], or, in the German case, the divine right of the princes. Second, the violent actions of rebelling, robbing, and plundering placed the peasants "outside the law of God and Empire", so they deserved "death in body and soul, if only as highwaymen and murderers." Lastly, Luther charged the rebels with blasphemy for calling themselves "Christian brethren" and committing their sinful acts under the banner of the Gospel.<ref>Mullett, 166.</ref> Only later in life did he develop the [[Beerwolf]] concept permitting some cases of resistance against the government.<ref name=Whitford>Whitford, David, ''Tyranny and Resistance: The Magdeburg Confession and the Lutheran Tradition'', 2001, 144 pages</ref>

Without Luther's backing for the uprising, many rebels laid down their weapons; others felt betrayed. Their defeat by the [[Swabian League]] at the [[Battle of Frankenhausen]] on 15 May 1525, followed by Müntzer's execution, brought the revolutionary stage of the Reformation to a close.<ref>Hughes, 51.</ref> Thereafter, radicalism found a refuge in the [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] movement and other religious movements, while Luther's Reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers.<ref>Andrew Pettegree, ''Europe in the Sixteenth Century'', Oxford: Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-20704-X}}, 102–103.</ref> In 1526 Luther wrote: "I, Martin Luther, have during the rebellion slain all the peasants, for it was I who ordered them to be struck dead."<ref>Erlangen Edition of ''Luther's Works'', Vol. 59, p. 284</ref>

===Organising the church: 1525–1529===
[[File:Kirchenordnung Mecklenburg 1650.jpg|thumb|upright|Church orders, Mecklenburg 1650]]
By 1526, Luther found himself increasingly occupied in organising a new church. His biblical ideal of congregations choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable.<ref>MacCulloch, 164.</ref> According to Bainton: "Luther's dilemma was that he wanted both a confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality. If he were forced to choose, he would take his stand with the masses, and this was the direction in which he moved."<ref>Bainton, Mentor edition, 243.</ref>

From 1525 to 1529, he established a supervisory church body, laid down a new form of [[Church service|worship service]], and wrote a clear summary of the new faith in the form of two [[Catechism#Lutheran catechisms|catechisms]].<ref name="Schroeder2000">{{cite book|first=Steven|last=Schroeder|title=Between Freedom and Necessity: An Essay on the Place of Value|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfT6aQvkVfAC&pg=PA104|year=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1302-5|page=104}}</ref> To avoid confusing or upsetting the people, Luther avoided extreme change. He also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another. He concentrated on the church in the [[Electorate of Saxony]], acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories, many of which followed his Saxon model. He worked closely with the new elector, John the Steadfast, to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome.<ref>Brecht, 2:260–63, 67; Mullett, 184–86.</ref> For Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, this partnership "was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign".<ref>Brecht, 2:267; Bainton, Mentor edition, 244.</ref>

The elector authorised a [[Canonical visitation|visitation]] of the church, a power formerly exercised by bishops.<ref>Brecht, 2:267; MacCulloch, 165. On one occasion, Luther referred to the elector as an "emergency bishop" (''Notbischof'').</ref> At times, Luther's practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements. For example, the ''Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony'' (1528), drafted by Melanchthon with Luther's approval, stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins, despite Luther's position that faith alone ensures justification.<ref>Mullett, 186–187; Brecht, 2:264–265, 267.</ref> The [[Eisleben]] reformer [[Johannes Agricola]] challenged this compromise, and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works.<ref>Brecht, 2:264–265.</ref> The ''Instruction'' is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther's thought and practice.<ref>Brecht, 2:268.</ref>

[[File:Luckau Nikolaikirche Abendmahlsbild.jpg|thumb|left|Lutheran church liturgy and sacraments]]
In response to demands for a German [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]], Luther wrote a ''[[Deutsche Messe|German Mass]]'', which he published in early 1526.<ref>Brecht, 2:251–254; Bainton, Mentor edition, 266.</ref> He did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the "simple people", a "public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians."<ref>Brecht, 2:255.</ref> Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted "everything that smacks of sacrifice", and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread.<ref>Mullett, 183; Eric W. Gritsch, ''A History of Lutheranism'', Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8006-3472-1}}, 37.</ref> He retained the [[Elevation (liturgy)|elevation of the host]] and [[Chalice#Christian|chalice]], while trappings such as the Mass [[vestment]]s, altar, and candles were made optional, allowing freedom of ceremony.<ref>Brecht, 2:256; Mullett, 183.</ref> Some reformers, including followers of [[Huldrych Zwingli]], considered Luther's service too papistic, and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic Mass.<ref>Brecht, 2:256; Bainton, Mentor edition, 265–266.</ref> Luther's service, however, included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German, as well as parts of the liturgy, including Luther's unison setting of the [[Apostles' Creed|Creed]].<ref>Brecht, 2:256; Bainton, Mentor edition, 269–270.</ref> To reach the simple people and the young, Luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of catechism.<ref>Brecht, 2:256–57.</ref> He also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services.<ref>Brecht, 2:258.</ref> The former included the "[[flood prayer]]".<ref name=Birkholz>{{cite web |last1=Birkholz |first1=Mark |title=Luther's Flood Prayer |url=https://lutheranreformation.org/history/luthers-flood-prayer/ |website=Lutheran Reformation |publisher=[[Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod]] |access-date=7 October 2024 |date=3 January 2016}}</ref>

Luther and his colleagues introduced the new order of worship during their visitation of the Electorate of Saxony, which began in 1527.<ref>Brecht, 2:263.</ref> They also assessed the standard of pastoral care and Christian education in the territory. "Merciful God, what misery I have seen," Luther writes, "the common people knowing nothing at all of Christian doctrine ... and unfortunately many pastors are well-nigh unskilled and incapable of teaching."<ref>Mullett, 186. Quoted from Luther's preface to the ''Small Catechism'', 1529; MacCulloch, 165.</ref>

===Catechisms===
[[File:MartinLutherWindow.jpg|thumb|upright|A stained glass portrayal of Luther]]
Luther devised the catechism as a method of imparting the basics of Christianity to the congregations. In 1529, he wrote the [[Luther's Large Catechism|''Large Catechism'']], a manual for pastors and teachers, as well as a synopsis, the [[Luther's Small Catechism|''Small Catechism'']], to be memorised by the people.<ref>Marty, 123.</ref> The catechisms provided easy-to-understand instructional and devotional material on the [[s:Luther's Small Catechism#I. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS,|Ten Commandments]], the [[s:Luther's Small Catechism#II. THE CREED,|Apostles' Creed]], [[s:Luther's Small Catechism#III. THE LORD'S PRAYER,|The Lord's Prayer]], [[s:Luther's Small Catechism#IV. THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY BAPTISM,|baptism]], and the [[s:Luther's Small Catechism#VI. THE SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR,|Lord's Supper]].<ref>Brecht, 2:273; Bainton, Mentor edition, 263.</ref> Luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of Christian faith would not just be [[Rote learning|learned by rote]], "the way monkeys do it", but understood.<ref>Marty, 123; Wilson, 278.</ref>

The catechism is one of Luther's most personal works. "Regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes," he wrote, "I am quite cool and not at all eager about it because, roused by a Saturnian hunger, I would rather see them all devoured. For I acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine, except perhaps the ''[[On the Bondage of the Will|Bondage of the Will]]'' and the Catechism."<ref>Luther, Martin. ''Luther's Works''. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1971, 50:172–173; Bainton, Mentor edition, 263.</ref> The ''Small Catechism'' has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching.<ref>Brecht, 2:277, 280.</ref> It remains in use today, along with Luther's hymns and his translation of the Bible.

Luther's ''Small Catechism'' proved especially effective in helping parents teach their children; likewise the ''Large Catechism'' was effective for pastors.<ref>See texts at [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/wittenberg-luther.html#sw-hymn English translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716175426/http://www.projectwittenberg.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/wittenberg-luther.html#sw-hymn |date=16 July 2017 }}</ref> Using the German vernacular, they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] language. He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit. Luther's goal was to enable the [[catechumen]]s to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity, each of which works in the catechumen's life.<ref name="James Arne Nestingen 1996">Charles P. Arand, "Luther on the Creed." ''[[Lutheran Quarterly]]'' 2006 20(1): 1–25. {{ISSN|0024-7499}}; James Arne Nestingen, "Luther's Catechisms" ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation.'' Ed. Hans J. Hillerbrand. (1996)</ref> That is, Luther depicts the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned, but as persons to be known. The Father creates, the Son redeems, and the Spirit sanctifies, a divine unity with separate personalities. Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father. Luther's treatment of the Apostles' Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments) and The Lord's Prayer, which are also part of the Lutheran catechetical teaching.<ref name="James Arne Nestingen 1996" />

===Translation of the Old Testament: 1534–1535===
{{Main|Luther Bible}}
[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|Luther's 1534 Bible]]
Luther had published his German translation of the New Testament in 1522, and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the Old Testament in 1534, when the whole Bible was published. He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life.<ref>Mullett, 145; Lohse, 119.</ref> Others had previously translated the Bible into German, but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine.<ref>Mullett, 148–150.</ref>

Luther's translation used the variant of German spoken at the Saxon chancellery, intelligible to both northern and southern Germans.<ref>Wilson, 183; Brecht, 2:48–49.</ref> He intended his vigorous, direct language to make the Bible accessible to everyday Germans, "for we are removing impediments and difficulties so that other people may read it without hindrance."<ref>Mullett, 149; Wilson, 302.</ref> Published at a time of rising demand for German-language publications, Luther's version quickly became a popular and influential Bible translation. As such, it contributed a [[Early New High German#Chancery languages|distinct flavor]] to the German language and literature.<ref>Marius, 162.</ref> Furnished with notes and prefaces by Luther, and with woodcuts by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]] that contained anti-papal imagery, it played a major role in the spread of Luther's doctrine throughout Germany.<ref>Lohse, 112–117; Wilson, 183; Bainton, Mentor edition, 258.</ref> The Luther Bible influenced other vernacular translations, such as the [[Tyndale Bible]] (from 1525 forward), a precursor of the [[King James Version|King James Bible]].<ref>Daniel Weissbort and Astradur Eysteinsson (eds.), ''Translation – Theory and Practice: A Historical Reader'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-871200-6}}, 68.</ref>

When he was criticised for inserting the word "alone" after "faith" in {{bibleverse||Romans|3:28|NKJV}},<ref>Mullett, 148; Wilson, 185; Bainton, Mentor edition, 261. Luther inserted the word "alone" (''allein'') after the word "faith" in his translation of [[Epistle to the Romans|St Paul's Epistle to the Romans]], 3:28. The clause is rendered in the [[Authorised King James Version|English Authorised Version]] as "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law".</ref> he replied in part: "[T]he text itself and the meaning of St. Paul urgently require and demand it. For in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of Christian doctrine, namely, that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law. ... But when works are so completely cut away—and that must mean that faith alone justifies—whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say, 'Faith alone justifies us, and not works'."<ref>Lindberg, Carter.

Luther's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation. This behavior started with his learning of the execution of [[Jan van Essen and Hendrik Vos]], the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views, prompting Luther to write the hymn "[[Ein neues Lied wir heben an]]" ("A New Song We Raise"), which is generally known in English by John C. Messenger's translation by the title and first line "Flung to the Heedless Winds" and sung to the tune Ibstone composed in 1875 by Maria C.

Luther's 1524 creedal hymn "{{lang|de|[[Wir glauben all an einen Gott]]|italic=unset}}" ("We All Believe in One True God") is a three-stanza confession of faith prefiguring Luther's 1529 three-part explanation of the Apostles' Creed in the ''Small Catechism''. Luther's hymn, adapted and expanded from an earlier German creedal hymn, gained widespread use in vernacular Lutheran liturgies as early as 1525. Sixteenth-century Lutheran hymnals also included "Wir glauben all" among the catechetical hymns, although 18th-century hymnals tended to label the hymn as Trinitarian rather than catechetical, and 20th-century Lutherans rarely used the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune.<ref name="Christopher Boyd Brown 2005" />

Luther's 1538 hymnic version of the [[Lord's Prayer]], "[[Vater unser im Himmelreich]]", corresponds exactly to Luther's explanation of the prayer in the ''Small Catechism'', with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions, plus opening and closing stanzas. The hymn functions both as a liturgical setting of the Lord's Prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions. The extant manuscript shows multiple revisions, demonstrating Luther's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune. Other 16th- and 20th-century versifications of the Lord's Prayer have adopted Luther's tune, although modern texts are considerably shorter.<ref>Robin A. Leaver, "Luther's Catechism Hymns." ''[[Lutheran Quarterly]]'' 1998 12(1): 79–88, 89–98.</ref>

Luther wrote "[[Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir]]" ("From depths of woe I cry to You") in 1523 as a hymnic version of [[Psalm 130]] and sent it as a sample to encourage his colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in German worship. In a collaboration with [[Paul Speratus]], this and seven other hymns were published in the ''Achtliederbuch'', the [[first Lutheran hymnal]]. In 1524 Luther developed his original four-stanza psalm paraphrase into a five-stanza Reformation hymn that developed the theme of "grace alone" more fully. Because it expressed essential Reformation doctrine, this expanded version of "Aus tiefer Not" was designated as a regular component of several regional Lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals, including Luther's own. Along with [[Erhard Hegenwald|Erhart Hegenwalt's]] hymnic version of [[Psalm 51]], Luther's expanded hymn was also adopted for use with the fifth part of Luther's catechism, concerning confession.<ref>Robin A. Leaver, "Luther's Catechism Hymns: 5. Baptism." ''[[Lutheran Quarterly]]'' 1998 12(2): 160–169, 170–180.</ref>

Luther wrote "[[Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein]]" ("Oh God, look down from heaven"). "[[Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland]]" (Now come, Savior of the gentiles), based on ''[[Veni redemptor gentium]]'', became the main hymn (Hauptlied) for [[Advent]]. He transformed ''A solus ortus cardine'' to "{{lang|de|[[Christum wir sollen loben schon]]|italic=unset}}" ("We should now praise Christ") and ''[[Veni Creator Spiritus]]'' to "{{lang|de|[[Komm, Gott Schöpfer, Heiliger Geist]]|italic=unset}}" ("Come, Holy Spirit, Lord God").<ref>Christoph Markschies, Michael Trowitzsch: ''Luther zwischen den Zeiten&nbsp;– Eine Jenaer Ringvorlesung''; Mohr Siebeck, 1999; pp. 215–219 (in German).</ref> He wrote two hymns on the [[s:The Decalogue|Ten Commandments]], "{{lang|de|[[Dies sind die heilgen Zehn Gebot]]|italic=unset}}" and "Mensch, willst du leben seliglich". His "[[Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ]]" ("Praise be to You, Jesus Christ") became the main hymn for Christmas. He wrote for [[Pentecost]] "[[Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist]]", and adopted for Easter "{{lang|de|[[Christ ist erstanden]]|italic=unset}}" (Christ is risen), based on [[Victimae paschali laudes]]. "{{lang|de|[[Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin]]|italic=unset}}", a paraphrase of [[Nunc dimittis]], was intended for [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Purification]], but became also a funeral hymn. He paraphrased the [[Te Deum]] as "[[Herr Gott, dich loben wir]]" with a simplified form of the melody. It became known as the German Te Deum.

Luther's 1541 hymn "{{lang|de|[[Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam]]|italic=unset}}" ("To Jordan came the Christ our Lord") reflects the structure and substance of his questions and answers concerning baptism in the ''Small Catechism''. Luther adopted a preexisting [[Johann Walter]] tune associated with a hymnic setting of [[Psalm 67]]'s prayer for grace; Wolf Heintz's four-part setting of the hymn was used to introduce the Lutheran Reformation in Halle in 1541. Preachers and composers of the 18th century, including [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]], used this rich hymn as a subject for their own work, although its objective baptismal theology was displaced by more subjective hymns under the influence of late-19th-century Lutheran [[pietism]].<ref name="Christopher Boyd Brown 2005" />

Luther's hymns were included in early Lutheran hymnals and spread the ideas of the Reformation. He supplied four of eight songs of the First Lutheran hymnal ''Achtliederbuch'', 18 of 26 songs of the ''[[Erfurt Enchiridion]]'', and 24 of the 32 songs in the first choral hymnal with settings by Johann Walter, ''[[Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn]]'', all published in 1524. Luther's hymns inspired composers to write music. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] included several verses as [[chorale]]s in his [[Bach cantata|cantatas]] and based [[Chorale cantata (Bach)|chorale cantatas]] entirely on them, namely [[BWV 4|''Christ lag in Todes Banden'', BWV 4]], as early as possibly 1707, in his second annual cycle (1724 to 1725) [[BWV 2|''Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein'', BWV 2]], [[BWV 7|''Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam'', BWV 7]], [[BWV 62|''Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland'', BWV 62]], [[BWV 91|''Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ'', BWV 91]], and [[BWV 38|''Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir'', BWV 38]], later [[BWV 80|''Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott'', BWV 80]], and in 1735 [[BWV 14|''Wär Gott nicht mit uns diese Zeit'', BWV 14]].

===On the soul after death===
[[File:Epi Michael-Meienburg-1555.jpg|thumb|Luther on the left with [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] being raised by Jesus from the dead, painting by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1558]]
In contrast to the views of [[John Calvin]]<ref>''Psychopannychia'' (the night banquet of the soul), manuscript Orléans 1534, Latin Strasbourg 1542, 2nd.ed. 1545, French, Geneva 1558, English 1581.</ref> and [[Philipp Melanchthon]],<ref>''Liber de Anima'' 1562</ref> throughout his life Luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a Christian's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death.<ref>D. Franz Pieper ''Christliche Dogmatik'', 3 vols., (Saint Louis: CPH, 1920), 3:575: "Hieraus geht sicher so viel hervor, daß die abgeschiedenen Seelen der Gläubigen in einem Zustande des seligen Genießens Gottes sich befinden .... Ein Seelenschlaf, der ein Genießen Gottes einschließt (so Luther), ist nicht als irrige Lehre zu bezeichnen"; English translation: Francis Pieper, ''Christian Dogmatics'', 3 vols., (Saint Louis: CPH, 1953), 3:512: "These texts surely make it evident that the departed souls of the believers are in a state of blessed enjoyment of God .... A sleep of the soul which includes enjoyment of God (says Luther) cannot be called a false doctrine."</ref> Accordingly, he disputed traditional interpretations of some Bible passages, such as the parable of the [[Rich man and Lazarus#Luther: a parable of the conscience|rich man and Lazarus]].<ref>''Sermons of Martin Luther: the House Postils'', Eugene F.A. Klug, ed. and trans., 3 vols., (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House, 1996), 2:240.</ref> This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints: "It is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell, but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace."<ref>Weimarer Ausgabe 43, 360, 21–23 (to Genesis 25:7–10): also Exegetica opera latina Vol 5–6 1833 p. 120 and the English translation: ''Luther's Works'', American Edition, 55 vols. (St. Louis: CPH), 4:313; "Sufficit igitur nobis haec cognitio, non egredi animas ex corporibus in periculum cruciatum et paenarum inferni, sed esse eis paratum cubiculum, in quo dormiant in pace."</ref> He also rejected the existence of [[purgatory]], which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookofconcord.org/smalcald.php#part2.2.12|title=Smalcald Articles, Part II, Article II, paragraph 12|publisher=Bookofconcord.org|access-date=15 August 2012|archive-date=10 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010210703/http://bookofconcord.org/smalcald.php#part2.2.12|url-status=dead}}</ref> He affirmed the continuity of one's personal identity beyond death. In his [[Smalcald Articles]], he described the saints as currently residing "in their graves and in heaven."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookofconcord.org/smalcald.php#part2.2.28|title=Smalcald Articles, Part II, Article II, paragraph 28|publisher=Bookofconcord.org|access-date=15 August 2012|archive-date=10 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010210703/http://bookofconcord.org/smalcald.php#part2.2.28|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Lutheran theologian [[Franz Pieper]] observes that Luther's teaching about the state of the Christian's soul after death differed from the later Lutheran theologians such as [[Johann Gerhard]].<ref>Gerhard ''Loci Theologici, Locus de Morte'', § 293 ff. Pieper writes: "Luther speaks more guardedly of the state of the soul between death and resurrection than do Gerhard and the later theologians, who transfer some things to the state between death and resurrection which can be said with certainty only of the state after the resurrection" (''Christian Dogmatics'', 3:512, footnote 21).</ref> [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] (1755) had earlier reached the same conclusion in his analysis of [[Lutheran orthodoxy]] on this issue.<ref>Article in the ''Berlinischer Zeitung'' 1755 in Complete Works ed. Karl Friedrich Theodor Lachmann&nbsp;– 1838 p. 59 "Was die Gegner auf alle diese Stellen antworten werden, ist leicht zu errathen. Sie werden sagen, daß Luther mit dem Worte Schlaf gar die Begriffe nicht verbinde, welche Herr R. damit verbindet. Wenn Luther sage, daß die Seele IS nach dem Tode schlafe, so denke er nichts mehr dabey, als was alle Leute denken, wenn sie den Tod des Schlafes Bruder nennen. Tode ruhe, leugneten auch die nicht, welche ihr Wachen behaupteten :c. Ueberhaupt ist mit Luthers Ansehen bey der ganzen Streitigkeit nichts zu gewinnen."</ref>

Luther's ''Commentary on Genesis'' contains a passage which concludes that "the soul does not sleep (''anima non sic dormit''), but wakes (''sed vigilat'') and experiences visions".<ref>Exegetica opera Latina, Volumes 5–6 Martin Luther, ed. Christopf Stephan Elsperger (Gottlieb) p. 120 "Differunt tamen somnus sive quies hujus vitae et futurae. Homo enim in hac vita defatigatus diurno labore, sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum tanquam in pace, ut ibi dormiat, et ea nocte fruitur quiete, neque quicquam scit de ullo malo sive incendii, sive caedis. Anima autem non sic dormit, sed vigilat, et patitur visiones loquelas Angelorum et Dei. Ideo somnus in futura vita profundior est quam in hac vita et tamen anima coram Deo vivit. Hac similitudine, quam habeo a somno viventia." (Commentary on Genesis&nbsp;– ''Enarrationes in Genesin'', XXV, 1535–1545)"</ref> [[Francis Blackburne (priest)|Francis Blackburne]] argues that [[John Jortin]] misread this and other passages from Luther,<ref>Blackburne ''A short historical view of the controversy concerning an intermediate state'' (1765) p. 121</ref> while [[Gottfried Fritschel]] points out that it actually refers to the soul of a man "in this life" (''homo enim in hac vita'') tired from his daily labour (''defatigus diurno labore'') who at night enters his bedchamber (''sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum'') and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams.<ref>[[Gottfried Fritschel]]. ''Zeitschrift für die gesammte lutherische Theologie und Kirche'' p. 657 "Denn dass Luther mit den Worten "anima non sic dormit, sed vigilat et patitur visiones, loquelas Angelorum et Dei" nicht dasjenige leugnen will, was er an allen andern Stellen seiner Schriften vortragt"</ref>

Henry Eyster Jacobs' English translation from 1898 reads:
:"Nevertheless, the sleep of this life and that of the future life differ; for '''in this life''', man, fatigued by his daily labour, at nightfall goes to his couch, as in peace, to sleep there, and enjoys rest; nor does he know anything of evil, whether of fire or of murder."<ref>Henry Eyster Jacobs ''Martin Luther the Hero of the Reformation 1483 to 1546'' (1898).

===Sacramentarian controversy and the Marburg Colloquy===
{{See also|The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ—Against the Fanatics}}
[[File:Religionsgespräch zu Marburg 1529 August Noack.jpg|thumb|''The Marburg Colloquy'', by August Noack]]
In October 1529, [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse]], convoked an assembly of German and Swiss theologians at the [[Marburg Colloquy]], to establish doctrinal unity in the emerging Protestant states.<ref>Mullett, 194–195.</ref> Agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen, the exception being the nature of the [[Eucharist]], the [[sacrament]] of the Lord's Supper, an issue crucial to Luther.<ref>Brecht, 2:325–334; Mullett, 197.</ref> The theologians, including Zwingli, Melanchthon, [[Martin Bucer]], and [[Johannes Oecolampadius]], differed on the significance of the words spoken by Jesus at the [[Last Supper]]: "This is my body which is for you" and "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" ([[1 Corinthians 11]]:23–26).<ref>Wilson, 259.</ref> Luther insisted on the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|Real presence]] of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine, which he called the [[sacramental union]],<ref>''[[Weimar Ausgabe]]'' 26, 442; ''Luther's Works'' 37, 299–300.</ref> while his opponents believed God to be only spiritually or symbolically present.<ref>Oberman, 237.</ref>

Zwingli, for example, denied Jesus' ability to be in more than one place at a time. Luther stressed the [[omnipresence]] of Jesus' human nature.<ref>Marty, 140–141; Lohse, 74–75.</ref> According to transcripts, the debate sometimes became confrontational. Citing Jesus' words "The flesh profiteth nothing" ([[Gospel of John|John]] 6.63), Zwingli said, "This passage breaks your neck". "Don't be too proud," Luther retorted, "German necks don't break that easily. This is Hesse, not Switzerland."<ref>Quoted by Oberman, 237.</ref> On his table Luther wrote the words "''Hoc est corpus meum''" ("This is my body") in chalk, to continually indicate his firm stance.<ref>Brecht 2:329.</ref>

Despite the disagreements on the Eucharist, the Marburg Colloquy paved the way for the signing in 1530 of the [[Augsburg Confession]], and for the formation of the [[Schmalkaldic League]] the following year by leading Protestant nobles such as [[John, Elector of Saxony|John of Saxony]], Philip of Hesse, and [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]]. The Swiss cities, however, did not sign these agreements.<ref>Oberman, 238.</ref>

===Epistemology of faith and reason===
Some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason. He wrote, "All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false."<ref>Martin Luther, ''Werke, VIII''</ref> and "[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things."<ref>Martin Luther, ''Table Talk''.</ref> However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason "strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it",<ref>Martin Luther, "On Justification CCXCIV", ''Table Talk''</ref> bringing claims he was a [[Fideism#Luther|fideist]] into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate [[Faith and rationality#Lutheran epistemology|faith and reason]] in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to.

The siege was lifted on 14 October 1529, which Luther saw as a divine miracle.</ref> Luther had argued against resisting the Turks in his 1518 ''Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses'', provoking accusations of defeatism. He saw the Turks as a [[Scourge#Metaphoric use|scourge]] sent by God to punish Christians, as agents of the biblical [[Apocalypse#End of the age|apocalypse]] that would destroy the [[Antichrist#Protestant Reformation|Antichrist]], whom Luther believed to be the papacy and the Roman Church.<ref>Andrew Cunningham, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hLxDnAMaUgQC&pg=PA141 ''The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Religion, War, Famine and Death in Reformation Europe''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221122074525/https://books.google.com/books?id=hLxDnAMaUgQC&pg=PA141 |date=22 November 2022 }}, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-521-46701-2}}, 141; Mullett, 239–240; Marty, 164.</ref> He consistently rejected the idea of a [[European wars of religion#Schmalkaldic Wars and other early conflicts|Holy War]], "as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks, who were enemies of Christ. This is absolutely contrary to Christ's doctrine and name".<ref>From ''[[On War against the Turk]]'', 1529, quoted in William P. Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=87hQ2AjcttEC&pg=PA258 ''The Ten Commandments: The Reciprocity of Faithfulness''], Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-664-22323-0}}, 258; Lohse, 61; Marty, 166.</ref> On the other hand, in keeping with his [[Two kingdoms doctrine#In Lutheran theology|doctrine of the two kingdoms]], Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks.<ref>Marty, 166; Marius, 219; Brecht, 2:365, 368.</ref> In 1526, he argued in ''Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace'' that national defence is reason for a just war.<ref>Mullett, 238–239; Lohse, 59–61.</ref> By 1529, in ''[[On War against the Turk]]'', he was actively urging Emperor Charles&nbsp;V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks.<ref>Brecht, 2:364.</ref>
He made clear, however, that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate, to be waged through prayer and repentance.<ref>Wilson, 257; Brecht, 2:364–365.</ref> Around the time of the Siege of Vienna, Luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the Turks, asking God to "give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies".<ref>Brecht, 2:365; Mullett, 239.</ref>

In 1542, Luther read a Latin translation of the [[Quran translations#Latin|Qur'an]].<ref>Brecht, 3:354.</ref> He went on to produce several critical pamphlets on [[Islam]], which he called "Mohammedanism" or "the Turk".<ref>Daniel Goffman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3uJzjatjTL4C&pg=PA109 ''The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221122074511/https://books.google.com/books?id=3uJzjatjTL4C&pg=PA109 |date=22 November 2022 }}, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-521-45908-7}}, 109; Mullett, 241; Marty, 163.</ref> Though Luther saw the Muslim religion as a tool of the devil, he was indifferent to its practice: "Let the Turk believe and live as he will, just as one lets the papacy and other false Christians live."<ref>From ''On war against the Turk'', 1529, quoted in Roland E.

===Antinomian controversy===
[[File:LutherPulpit.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Pulpit of St Andreas Church, [[Eisleben]], where [[Johannes Agricola]] and Luther preached]]
Early in 1537, [[Johannes Agricola]]—serving at the time as pastor in Luther's birthplace, Eisleben—preached a sermon in which he claimed that God's gospel, not God's moral law (the Ten Commandments), revealed God's wrath to Christians. Based on this sermon and others by Agricola, Luther suspected that Agricola was behind certain anonymous [[Antinomianism|antinomian]] theses circulating in Wittenberg. These theses asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to Christians but belonged only to city hall.<ref>Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal: Martin Luther's Complete Antinomian Theses and Disputations,'' ed. and tr. H. Sonntag, Minneapolis: Lutheran Press, 2008, 23–27. {{ISBN|978-0-9748529-6-6}}</ref> Luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against Agricola and the antinomians, four of which became the basis for [[disputation]]s between 1538 and 1540.<ref>Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal: Martin Luther's Complete Antinomian Theses and Disputations,'' ed. and tr. H. Sonntag, Minneapolis: Lutheran Press, 2008, 11–15. {{ISBN|978-0-9748529-6-6}}</ref> He also responded to these assertions in other writings, such as his 1539 [[open letter]] to C. Güttel ''Against the Antinomians'',<ref>Cf. ''Luther's Works'' 47:107–119. There he writes: "Dear God, should it be unbearable that the holy church confesses itself a sinner, believes in the forgiveness of sins, and asks for remission of sin in the Lord's Prayer? How can one know what sin is without the law and conscience? And how will we learn what Christ is, what he did for us, if we do not know what the law is that he fulfilled for us and what sin is, for which he made satisfaction?" (112–113).</ref> and his book ''On the Councils and the Church'' from the same year.<ref>Cf. ''Luther's Works'' 41, 113–114, 143–144, 146–147. There he said about the antinomians: "They may be fine Easter preachers, but they are very poor Pentecost preachers, for they do not preach ''de sanctificatione et vivificatione Spiritus Sancti'', "about the sanctification by the Holy Spirit," but solely about the redemption of Jesus Christ" (114). "Having rejected and being unable to understand the Ten Commandments, ... they see and yet they let the people go on in their public sins, without any renewal or reformation of their lives" (147).</ref>

In his theses and disputations against the antinomians, Luther reviews and reaffirms, on the one hand, what has been called the "second use of the law," that is, the law as the Holy Spirit's tool to work sorrow over sin in man's heart, thus preparing him for Christ's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel.<ref>Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal,'' 33–36.</ref> Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law, even if it is Christ's life, Christ's death for sin, or God's goodness experienced in creation.<ref>Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal'', 170–172</ref> Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians—thereby, as it were, removing the three letters l-a-w from the church—does not eliminate the accusing law.<ref>Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal'', 76, 105–107.</ref> Claiming that the law—in any form—should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people.<ref>Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal'', 140, 157.</ref>

Luther also points out that the Ten Commandments—when considered not as God's condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will, that is, of the natural law—positively teach how the Christian ought to live.<ref>Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal'', 75, 104–105, 172–173.</ref> This has traditionally been called the "third use of the law."<ref>The "first use of the law," accordingly, would be the law used as an external means of order and coercion in the political realm by means of bodily rewards and punishments.</ref> For Luther, also Christ's life, when understood as an example, is nothing more than an illustration of the Ten Commandments, which a Christian should follow in his or her [[vocation]]s on a daily basis.<ref>Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal'', 110.</ref>

The Ten Commandments, and the beginnings of the renewed life of Christians accorded to them by the sacrament of [[Lutheranism#Baptism|baptism]], are a present foreshadowing of the believers' future [[angel]]-like life in heaven in the midst of this life.<ref>Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal'', 35: "The law, therefore, cannot be eliminated, but remains, prior to Christ as not fulfilled, after Christ as to be fulfilled, although this does not happen perfectly in this life even by the justified. ... This will happen perfectly first in the coming life." Cf. Luther, ''Only the Decalogue Is Eternal,'', 43–44, 91–93.</ref> Luther's teaching of the Ten Commandments, therefore, has clear [[Eschatology|eschatological]] overtones, which, characteristically for Luther, do not encourage world-flight but direct the Christian to service to the neighbor in the common, daily vocations of this perishing world.

===Bigamy of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse: 1539–1540===
From December 1539, Luther became involved in the designs of [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse#Bigamous marriage|Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse]] to marry a lady-in-waiting of his wife, [[Christine of Saxony]]. Philip solicited the approval of Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer, citing as a precedent the [[Polygamy in Christianity|polygamy of the patriarchs]]. The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling, and they reluctantly advised the [[landgrave]] that if he was determined, he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter because divorce was worse than [[bigamy]].<ref>Brecht, Martin, ''Martin Luther'', tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 3: 206. For a more extensive list of quotes from Luther on the topic of polygamy, see page 11 and following of [https://www.cuw.edu/academics/schools/arts-and-sciences/_assets/theological-journal/v3i1-Fall_2015.pdf Luther's Authentic Voice on Polygamy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120194507/https://www.cuw.edu/academics/schools/arts-and-sciences/_assets/theological-journal/v3i1-Fall_2015.pdf |date=20 January 2019 }} Nathan R. Jastram, Concordia Theological Journal, Fall 2015/Spring 2016, Volume 3</ref> As a result, on 4 March 1540, Philip married a second wife, [[Margarethe von der Saale]], with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses. Philip's sister [[Elisabeth of Hesse, Hereditary Princess of Saxony|Elisabeth]] quickly made the scandal public, and Philip threatened to expose Luther's advice.

New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, 109; Mullett, 242.</ref> Though Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life, his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ, and he lived in a locality which had expelled Jews roughly 90 years earlier.<ref>Edwards, Mark. ''Luther's Last Battles''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1983, 121.</ref> He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus.<ref>[[Martin Brecht|Brecht]], 3:341–343; Mullett, 241; Marty, 172.</ref> In 1523, Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in ''That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew'' and also aimed to convert them to Christianity.<ref>Brecht, 3:334; Marty, 169; Marius, 235.</ref> When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them.<ref>Noble, Graham. "Martin Luther and German anti-Semitism," ''History Review'' (2002) No. 42:1–2; Mullett, 246.</ref>

Luther's major works on the Jews were his 60,000-word treatise ''Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen'' (''[[On the Jews and Their Lies]]''), and ''Vom Schem Hamphoras und vom Geschlecht Christi'' (''[[Vom Schem Hamphoras|On the Holy Name and the Lineage of Christ]]''), both published in 1543, three years before his death.<ref>Brecht, 3:341–347.</ref> Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but "the devil's people", and referred to them with violent language.<ref>Luther, ''On the Jews and their Lies'', quoted in Michael, 112.</ref><ref>Luther, ''Vom Schem Hamphoras'', quoted in Michael, 113.</ref> Citing Deuteronomy 13, wherein [[Moses]] commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God, Luther called for a "''scharfe Barmherzigkeit''" ("sharp mercy") against the Jews "to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames."<ref name=gritsch8687>Gritsch, Eric W.

Luther launched a polemic against vagrants in his 1528 preface to ''[[Liber Vagatorum]]'', saying that the Jews had contributed Hebrew words as a main basis of the ''[[Rotwelsch]]'' [[cryptolect]]. He warned in the admonitory preface Christians not to give them alms as it was, in his opinion, to forsake the truly poor.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Dialects of the Yiddish Language: Winter Studies in Yiddish, Volume 2.

His last sermon was delivered at Eisleben, his place of birth, on 15 February 1546, three days before his death.<ref>Luther, Martin. Sermon No. 8, "Predigt über Mat. 11:25, Eisleben gehalten," 15 February 1546, ''Luthers Werke'', Weimar 1914, 51:196–197.</ref> It was "entirely devoted to the obdurate Jews, whom it was a matter of great urgency to expel from all German territory," according to [[Léon Poliakov]].<ref>[[Léon Poliakov|Poliakov, Léon]].

Luther's final journey, to Mansfeld, was taken because of his concern for his siblings' families continuing in their father Hans Luther's copper mining trade. Their livelihood was threatened by Count Albrecht of Mansfeld bringing the industry under his own control. The controversy that ensued involved all four Mansfeld counts: Albrecht, Philip, John George, and Gerhard. Luther journeyed to Mansfeld twice in late 1545 to participate in the negotiations for a settlement, and a third visit was needed in early 1546 for their completion.

The negotiations were successfully concluded on 17 February 1546. After 8&nbsp;p.m., he experienced chest pains. When he went to his bed, he prayed, "Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O Lord, faithful God" (Ps. 31:5), the common prayer of the dying. At 1&nbsp;a.m. on 18 February, he awoke with more chest pain and was warmed with hot towels. He thanked God for revealing his Son to him in whom he had believed. His companions, Justus Jonas and Michael Coelius, shouted loudly, "Reverend father, are you ready to die trusting in your Lord Jesus Christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name?" A distinct "Yes" was Luther's reply.<ref name=Reeves60>Reeves, Michael. "The Unquenchable Flame". Nottingham: IVP, 2009, p. 60.</ref>

An apoplectic stroke deprived him of his speech, and he died shortly afterwards at 2:45&nbsp;a.m. on 18 February 1546, aged 62, in Eisleben, the city of his birth. He was buried in the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|Schlosskirche]] in Wittenberg, in front of the pulpit.<ref>[[Brecht, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. tr. James L.

A piece of paper was later found on which Luther had written his last statement. The statement was in Latin, apart from "We are beggars," which was in German. The statement reads:

<blockquote><poem># No one can understand [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Bucolics]]'' unless he has been a shepherd for five years. No one can understand Virgil's ''[[Georgics]]'', unless he has been a farmer for five years.
# No one can understand [[Cicero's Letters|Cicero's ''Letters'']] (or so I teach), unless he has busied himself in the affairs of some prominent state for twenty years.
# Know that no one can have indulged in the Holy Writers sufficiently, unless he has governed churches for a hundred years with the prophets, such as [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]], [[John the Baptist]], Christ and the apostles.

Do not assail this divine [[Aeneid]]; nay, rather prostrate revere the ground that it treads.

On 17 December 1941, seven Protestant regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing Jews to wear the [[yellow badge]], "since after his bitter experience Luther had already suggested preventive measures against the Jews and their expulsion from German territory." According to [[Daniel Goldhagen]], Bishop [[Martin Sasse]], a leading Protestant churchman, published a compendium of Luther's writings shortly after [[Kristallnacht]], for which [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], professor of the history of the church at the [[University of Oxford]] argued that Luther's writing was a "blueprint."<ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''Reformation: Europe's House Divided, 1490–1700''.

At the heart of scholarly debate about Luther's influence is whether it is [[anachronism|anachronistic]] to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis. Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic.

Hillerbrand writes: "His strident pronouncements against the Jews, especially toward the end of his life, have raised the question of whether Luther significantly encouraged the development of German anti-Semitism.

However, Christopher J. Probst, in his book ''Demonizing the Jews: Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany'' (2012), shows that a large number of German Protestant clergy and theologians during the Nazi era used Luther's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify at least in part the antisemitic policies of the National Socialists.<ref>Christopher J.

Some scholars, such as Mark U. Edwards in his book ''Luther's Last Battles: Politics and Polemics 1531–46'' (1983), suggest that since Luther's increasingly antisemitic views developed during the years his health deteriorated, it is possible they were at least partly the product of a state of mind. Edwards also comments that Luther often deliberately used "vulgarity and violence" for effect, both in his writings condemning the Jews and in diatribes against "Turks" (Muslims) and Catholics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theologian.org.uk/churchhistory/lutherandthejews.html#_ftnref67|title=Martin Luther and "The Jews" A Reappraisal|author=Dr. Christopher Probst|publisher=The Theologian|access-date=20 March 2014}}</ref>

==Legacy and commemoration==
[[File:Countries by percentage of Protestants.svg|thumb|Worldwide Protestantism in 2010]]
Luther made effective use of [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s printing press to spread his views. He switched from Latin to German in his writing to appeal to a broader audience. Between 1500 and 1530, Luther's works represented one fifth of all materials printed in Germany.<ref>Wall Street Journal, "The Monk Who Shook the World", Richard J. Evans,
 31 March 2017</ref>

In the 1530s and 1540s, printed images of Luther that emphasized his monumental size were crucial to the spread of Protestantism. In contrast to images of frail Catholic saints, Luther was presented as a stout man with a "double chin, strong mouth, piercing deep-set eyes, fleshy face, and squat neck." He was shown to be physically imposing, an equal in stature to the secular German princes with whom he would join forces to spread Lutheranism. His large body also let the viewer know that he did not shun earthly pleasures like drinking—behavior that was a stark contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders. Images from this period include the woodcuts by [[Hans Brosamer]] (1530) and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]] (1546).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roper|first=Lyndal|author-link=Lyndal Roper|title=Martin Luther's Body: The 'Stout Doctor' and His Biographers|journal=American Historical Review|date=April 2010|volume=115|issue=2|pages=351–362|doi=10.1086/ahr.115.2.351|pmid=20509226|doi-access=free| issn = 0002-8762}}</ref>

[[File:Eisenach Germany Lutherdenkmal-Eisenach-03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Luther Monument]] in [[Eisenach]], Germany]]
Luther is honoured on 18 February with a commemoration in the [[Calendar of saints (Lutheran)|Lutheran Calendar of Saints]] and in the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church)|Episcopal (United States) Calendar of Saints]]. In the [[Church of England]]'s [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|Calendar of Saints]] he is [[Commemoration (Anglicanism)|commemorated]] on 31 October.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Calendar|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/calendar|access-date=9 April 2021|website=The Church of England|language=en}}</ref> Luther is honored in various ways by Christian traditions coming out directly from the Protestant Reformation, i.e. Lutheranism, the [[Calvinism|Reformed tradition]], and [[Anglicanism]]. Branches of Protestantism that emerged afterwards vary in their remembrance and veneration of Luther, ranging from a complete lack of a single mention of him to a commemoration almost comparable to the way Lutherans commemorate and remember his persona. There is no known condemnation of Luther by Protestants themselves.

Various sites both inside and outside Germany (supposedly) visited by Martin Luther throughout his lifetime commemorate it with local memorials. [[Saxony-Anhalt]] has two towns officially named after Luther, [[Lutherstadt Eisleben]] and [[Lutherstadt Wittenberg]]. [[Mansfeld]] is sometimes called Mansfeld-Lutherstadt, although the state government has not decided to put the ''[[Lutherstadt]]'' suffix in its official name.

[[Reformation Day]] commemorates the publication of the ''Ninety-five Theses'' in 1517 by Martin Luther; it has been historically important in the following European entities. It is a civic holiday in the German states of [[Brandenburg]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Thuringia]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Hamburg]]. Two further states ([[Lower Saxony]] and [[Bremen]]) are pending a vote on introducing it. Slovenia celebrates it because of the profound contribution of the Reformation to its culture. Austria allows Protestant children not to go to school that day, and Protestant workers have a right to leave work in order to participate in a church service. Switzerland celebrates the holiday on the first Sunday after 31 October. It is also celebrated elsewhere around the world.

Luther is often depicted with a swan as his [[Emblem|attribute]], and Lutheran churches often have a swan for a weather vane. This association with the swan arises out of a prophecy reportedly made by the earlier reformer Jan Hus from Bohemia and endorsed by Luther. In the [[Czech language|Bohemian language]] (now Czech), Hus's name meant [[:cz:Husa|"grey goose"]]. In 1414, while imprisoned by the Council of Constance and anticipating his execution by burning for heresy, Hus prophesied, "Now they will roast a goose, but in a hundred years' time they'll hear a swan sing. They'd better listen to him." Luther published his ''Ninety-five Theses'' some 103 years later.<ref>[https://www.hamburger-reformation.de/hamburger-reformation/panorama-geschichten/luther-und-der-schwan Luther und der Schwan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019013653/https://www.hamburger-reformation.de/hamburger-reformation/panorama-geschichten/luther-und-der-schwan |date=19 October 2019 }} hamburger-reformation.de, retrieved 19 October 2019</ref><ref>[https://lutheranpress.com/the-swan/ The Swan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200706123240/https://lutheranpress.com/the-swan/ |date=6 July 2020 }} Lutheran Press, retrieved 6 July 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/early-music-history/article/lutheran-identity-of-josquins-missa-pange-lingua-renaissance-of-a-renaissance-mass/BB791A5089D9E675993F0AA00EC4E4B0 The Lutheran Identity of Josquin's ''Missa Pange Lingua'' (reference note 94)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200706135913/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/early-music-history/article/lutheran-identity-of-josquins-missa-pange-lingua-renaissance-of-a-renaissance-mass/BB791A5089D9E675993F0AA00EC4E4B0 |date=6 July 2020 }} Early Music History, vol. 36, October 2017, pp. 193–249; CUP; retrieved 6 July 2020</ref>
