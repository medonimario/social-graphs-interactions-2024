'''Hao Wang''' ({{zh|c=王浩|p=Wáng Hào}}; 20 May 1921&nbsp;– 13 May 1995) was a Chinese-American [[logician]], philosopher, mathematician, and commentator on [[Kurt Gödel]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Jinan]], Shandong, in the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (today in the People's Republic of China), Wang received his early education in China. He obtained a BSc degree in mathematics from the [[National Southwestern Associated University]] in 1943 and an M.A. in philosophy from [[Tsinghua University]] in 1945, where his teachers included [[Feng Youlan]] and [[Jin Yuelin]], after which he moved to the United States for further graduate studies. He studied logic under W.V. Quine at [[Harvard University]], culminating in a Ph.D. in 1948. He was appointed to an assistant professorship at Harvard the same year.

During the early 1950s, Wang studied with [[Paul Bernays]] in [[Zürich]]. In 1956, he was appointed Reader in the Philosophy of Mathematics at the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1959, Wang wrote on an [[IBM 704]] computer a program that in only 9 minutes mechanically proved several hundred [[mathematical logic]] theorems in [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Wang |first1=Hao |title=Toward Mechanical Mathematics |doi=10.1147/rd.41.0002 |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |year=1960 |volume=4 |number=1 |pages=2–22}} [Wang 1960a].</ref> In 1961, he was appointed [[Gordon McKay]] Professor of Mathematical Logic and Applied Mathematics at Harvard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lewis.seas.harvard.edu/biocv |title = Brief Biography {{!}} Harry R. Lewis}}</ref> From 1967 until 1991, he headed the logic research group at [[Rockefeller University]] in New York City, where he was professor of logic.  In 1972, Wang joined in a group of Chinese American scientists led by [[Chih-Kung Jen]] as the first such delegation from the U.S. to the People's Republic of China.

One of Wang's most important contributions was the [[Wang tile]].<ref>[Wang 1960a].</ref> He showed that any [[Turing machine]] can be turned into a set of Wang tiles. The domino problem is to find an algorithm that uses a set of Wang tiles to tile the plane. The first noted example of [[aperiodic tiling]] is a set of Wang tiles, whose nonexistence Wang had once conjectured, discovered by his student [[Robert Berger (mathematician)|Robert Berger]] in 1966. Wang also had a significant influence on theory of computational complexity.<ref>50 Years of Computational Complexity: Hao Wang and the Theory of Computation, https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05274</ref>

A philosopher in his own right,<ref>[Wang 1974 and 1985a]</ref> Wang also developed a penetrating interpretation of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy of mathematics, which he called "anthropologism."  Later he broadened this reading in the foundations of mathematics.  He chronicled [[Kurt Gödel]]'s philosophical ideas and authored several books on the subject,<ref>[Wang 1996a, 1987a, and in 1974a].</ref> thereby providing contemporary scholars many insights elucidating Gödel's later philosophical thought. He saw his own philosophy of "substantial factualism" as a middle ground that includes both abstract theoretical formulations and the ordinary language of everyday discourse.

In 1983 he was presented with the first Milestone Prize for [[Automated theorem proving|Automated Theorem-Proving]], sponsored by the [[International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Loveland, Donald W. |author2=Bledsoe, W.

On May 13, 1995, Wang died at [[Weill Cornell Medical Center|New York Hospital]] one week from his 74th birthday. According to his wife Hanne Tierney, Wang's cause of death was from [[lymphoma]].<ref name="NYTObituary">{{Cite news |date=1995-05-17 |title=Hao Wang, 73, Expander of Logician's Themes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/17/obituaries/hao-wang-73-expander-of-logician-s-themes.html |access-date=2024-03-30 |work=[[The New York Times]] |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name="TheBulletinOfSymbolicLogic_Parsons1996">{{Cite journal |last=Parsons |first=Charles |date=March 1996 |title=In Memoriam: Hao Wang, 1921-1995 |journal=The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic |volume=2 |issue=1 |jstor=421050 |via=[[JSTOR]]}}</ref> In addition to Tierney, Wang was survived by a daughter and two sons.<ref name="NYTObituary" />
