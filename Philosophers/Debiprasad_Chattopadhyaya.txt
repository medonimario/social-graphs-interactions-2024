'''Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya''' (19 November 1918 – 8 May 1993) was an Indian [[Marxist]] philosopher. He made contributions to the exploration of the [[Materialism|materialist]] current in ancient [[Indian philosophy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/govind-pansare-mm-kalburgi-gauri-lankesh-murder-5316465/|title=Indian rationalism, Charvaka to Narendra Dabholkar|date=21 August 2018 }}</ref> He is known for ''[[Lokayata: A Study in Ancient Indian Materialism]]'', which is his exposition of the philosophy of [[Lokayata]]. He is also known for work on [[History of science#India|history of science]] and [[History of science and technology in the Indian subcontinent|scientific method in ancient India]], especially his 1977 book ''Science and Society in Ancient India'' on the ancient physicians [[Charaka]] and [[Sushruta]]. He was awarded the [[Padma Bhushan]], India's third highest civilian honour, posthumously, in 1998.

==Biography==

Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya was born on 19 November 1918 in [[Calcutta]]. His father was a supporter of India's freedom struggle. It was probably his influence that initiated Debiprasad to two major passions in his life – Indian philosophy and politics; he quickly progressed towards radical streams in both fields, developing a lifelong commitment to Marxism and communist movement. At a very early stage of his life Chattopadhyaya immersed himself in the left nationalist movement by joining the [[Progressive Writers' Movement|Association of Progressive Writers]], which was formed in 1936.

Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya obtained his academic training in philosophy in Calcutta, West Bengal under eminent philosophers like [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]] and [[S. N. Dasgupta]]. After standing first in philosophy at [[University of Calcutta]] both in B.A. (1939) and M.A. (1942), he did his post-graduate research work under Prof [[S. N. Dasgupta]]. He taught philosophy at the City College of Calcutta for three decades. Subsequently, he was appointed a UGC Visiting Professor at the universities of Andhra Pradesh, Calcutta and Poona. He remained associated with the activities of the [[Indian Council of Historical Research]] (ICHR), Indian Council of Philosophical Research (ICPHR) and the [[National Institute of Science, Technology and Development Studies]] (NISTADS) of the [[CSIR India|Council of Scientific & Industrial Research]] (CSIR) under various capacities. His second wife was the renowned educationist and [[Tibetologist]], Dr. Alaka Majumder Chattopadhyaya (1926–1998).

Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya's work on materialism and scientific method led to his active interactions with the international community of philosophers, historians and Indologists. He collaborated with some of the outstanding western scholars of the 20th century, like [[Joseph Needham]], [[George Thomson (Marxist philosopher)|George Thomson]], Bongard Levin and [[Walter Ruben (Indologist)|Walter Ruben]].<ref>citation?</ref> He was fellow of the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|German]] and [[USSR Academy of Sciences|USSR Academies of Sciences]].

He died in [[Calcutta]] on 8 May 1993.<ref>Most of the biographical materials are extracted from S.K. Biswas, "Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya – The Modern Indian Sage", ''Current Science'', Vol 65 No 11, 10 December 1993, pp. 889–891 [http://www.ias.ac.in/j_archive/currsci/65/vol65contents.html]</ref>

==Major works==

===''Lokayata: A Study in Ancient Indian Materialism'' (1959)===
{{Main|Lokayata: A Study in Ancient Indian Materialism}}
In his writings, Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya aimed to illuminate science and materialism in ancient India, and to trace their evolution. While commenting on his work on Lokayata, German indologist [[Walter Ruben (Indologist)|Walter Ruben]] called him a "thought-reformer", who was "conscious of his great responsibility towards his people living in a period of struggle for national awakening and of world-wide fighting for the forces of materialism, progress, humanism and peace against imperialism. He has written this book ''Lokayata: A Study in Ancient Indian Materialism'' against the old fashioned conception that India was and is the land of dreamers and mystics".<ref>Quoted in Rajendra Prasad, "Obituary – Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya", ''Social Scientist'', Vol 21 No 5-6, May–June 1993, pp. 102–105</ref>

This study questioned the mainstream view that Indian philosophy's sole concern was the concept of [[Brahman]]. "From the scattered references in the ancient philosophical literature which were completely hostile to the ancient materialist schools, Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya reconstructed the philosophy of [[Lokayata]], which consistently denied the existence of brahman and viewed pratyaksa (perception) as the sole means of knowledge. He demolished the so-called "interpretation of synthesis" which sought to combine the diverse philosophical traditions of India to form a ladder that leads to the philosophy of [[Advaita Vedanta]].<ref>Rajendra Prasad, "Obituary – Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya", ''Social Scientist'', Vol 21 No 5-6, May–June 1993, pp. 102–105</ref>

Being a Marxist, Chattopadhyaya's uses the method of [[historical materialism]] to study "the ultimate material basis of the primitive ''deha-vada'' and the primitive rituals related to it" and to reveal how these could "be connected with the mode of securing the material means of subsistence". He also traced "the course of development this archaic outlook eventually underwent".

===''Indian Philosophy: A Popular Outline (1964)''===
It was an introductory book that examined Indian philosophy through an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on anthropological, economic and philological studies. The book traced the philosophical development in India from the [[Vedic period]] to later Buddhism. In this introductory study, Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya targets another important myth that overshadows the study of Indian philosophy – that of the presupposed predominance of ''[[shastrartha]]'' or textual interpretation. He views the development of Indian philosophy as the consequence of real clashes of ideas – "contradiction constituted the moving force behind the Indian philosophical development".<ref>''Indian Philosophy'', pp 27</ref> Dale Riepe in his review of this book says that Chattopadhyaya "combines the analytic sagacity of Hume with the impatient realism of Lenin".<ref>Dale Riepe, Review of "Indian Philosophy – A Popular Introduction", ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', Vol 26 No 4, (June 1966), pp. 611–612</ref>

===''Indian Atheism: A Marxist Analysis (1969)''===
This is yet another provocative critique of the standard accounts of Indian philosophy and religion. This book brings out a coherent historical account of atheism in India. In fact, according to Chattopadhyaya, "an unbiased survey of the Vedas clearly shows the total absence of religious consciousness in its earlier stage and the [[Rgveda]] is full of relics of this stage of thought. Even the world [[polytheism]] is misapplied to such an early stage of the Vedic thought".<ref name="Indian Atheism, pp 39n"/>

===''What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy (1976)''===
{{Main|What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy}}
In the Preface, Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya says his purpose in this book is to present "an analysis of our philosophical traditions from the standpoint of our present philosophical requirements. These requirements, as understood here, are secularism, rationalism and science-orientation". He once again finds the philosophical development – debates and clashes – in ancient India embedded in the class struggles of the time. He discusses the materialist foundation of Vedic rituals, which he finds similar to the magical belief of controlling the natural forces through [[yajnas]], etc. He shows how these rites and rituals that evolved as primitive scientific endeavours were transformed into superstitions and monopolies in the hands of the oppressors with the advent of class divisions.

The book also endeavours to demonstrate how Indian philosophy was not any exception to the sharp conflicts between idealism and materialism, which are universally evident in the philosophical traditions of other regions. Further, it considers the role of the law-givers like [[Manu Smriti|Manu]] in establishing the supremacy of the idealist traditions, and how due to the censor and censure anti-idealists like [[Varahamihira]] and [[Brahmagupta]] worked out their philosophies in distinctive [[Aesopian language]], developing their own modes of camouflaging their ideas.

Like elsewhere, in India too anti-idealists and materialists took practice as the main criterion of truth. [[Nyaya]]-[[Vaisheshika]]s were most outspoken in this regard, "after a knowledge is proved true in practice, there remains no doubt about the proof; hence the question of proving does not arise".<ref>''What is Living and What is Dead in Indian Philosophy'', pp. 359</ref> On the other hand, the idealists believed in complete separation between theory and practice. They adhered to, in the words of [[Kumarila Bhatta]], the principle of ''bahyartha-sunyatva'' (the unreality of the objects of knowledge), which, according to Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, formed "the real pivot of idealism throughout its Indian career".<ref>''Ibid'', pp. 46</ref>

===''Science and Society in Ancient India (1977)''===
This book is about [[scientific method]] in ancient India and how societal divisions of the time shaped the development of science. Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya chooses the field of medicine for the purpose, because, according to him, "the only discipline that promises to be fully secular and contains clear potentials of the modern understanding of natural science is medicine".<ref>''Science and Society in Ancient India'', pp. 3</ref>

The main concentration of the book is to present an analysis of ''[[Caraka Samhita]]'', the crucial source book on Indian medicine. According to Chattopadhyaya, "discarding scripture orientation, they [the Indian physicians] insist on the supreme importance of direct observation of natural phenomena and on the technique of rational processing of the empirical data. They go even to the extent of claiming that the truth of any conclusion thus arrived at is to be tested ultimately by the criterion of practice".<ref>''Ibid'', pp. 7</ref> For them, "everything in nature occurs according to some immutable laws, the body of which is usually called [[svabhava]] in Indian thought"<ref>''Ibid'', pp. 64</ref> and "from the medical viewpoint there can be nothing which is not made of matter".<ref>''Ibid'', pp. 66</ref> They even say that "a substance is called conscious when it is endowed with the sense-organs".<ref>''Ibid'', pp. 72</ref> Further, Chattopadhyaya shows: 
:"If anywhere in ancient Indian thought we are permitted to see the real anticipation of the view that knowledge is power – which, when further worked out, assumes the formulation that freedom is the recognition of necessity – it is to be found among the practitioners of the healing art".<ref>''Ibid'', pp. 180</ref>

Chattopadhyaya also tries to show in the book, how societal divisions, especially the [[caste system]], which was enforced by the law-givers and their justificatory idealist ideologies, formed obstructions in the way of scientific development in India.

===''Lenin, the Philosopher (1979)''===
This book was written in the context of growing state authoritarianism during the [[Indian Emergency (1975 - 77)|Indian Emergency]] declared by [[Indira Gandhi]], on the one hand, and the upsurge of rightist forces in the form of [[Jan Sangh]], [[Shiv Sena (1966–2022)|Shiv Sena]] etc., on the other.  Chattopadhyaya opined "that in these grim and anxious days through which India today is passing, that which holds hope for our future is the growing awareness of our people of socialism being the only way out". And, "an essential pre-condition for moving forward to Socialism is the consolidation of Socialist consciousness in its right sense among the Indians today", for which "it is imperative to understand and absorb the philosophical views of Lenin".<ref>''Lenin, the Philosopher'', pp.1</ref>

This book is meant to be a "guide or introduction" to Lenin's philosophical writings. It seeks "to lead the readers to the actual study of Lenin, providing them with some clarifications, annotations and summations that they may be useful only for the limited of a preliminary acquaintance with Lenin's philosophical ideas".<ref>''Ibid'', pp.2</ref>

Communist leader [[E.M.S. Namboodiripad]] in his overall appreciative review of the book criticised Chattopadhyaya for not explaining "in a sufficiently convincing way as to why Lenin thought it necessary to go to Hegel in his later years", as evident from his ''[[Philosophical Notebooks]] of 1914''.<ref>E.M.S. Namboodiripad, "Dialectical" Materialism and Dialectical "Materialism", ''Social Scientist'', Vol 10 No 4 (Apr 1982), pp.52–59</ref>

== Reception ==

Gerald Larson sees Chattopadhyaya's writings on ancient Indian philosophies as the most interesting and sustained Marxist interpretation of Indian thought.<ref>Gerald Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, page 63</ref> Reviewing Chattopadhyaya's writings on [[Samkhya]] philosophy he observes, "Chattopadhyaya proceeds to reconstruct what the original Samkhya position was, claiming that the classical notion did not include [[Purusha]], and that the most important notion in the Samkhya is [[Prakṛti|Prakrti]], citing pre-Vedic Tantra traditions of a matriarchal society to be the foundation of original Samkhya."<ref>Gerald Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, pages 64-66</ref> But disagreeing with this conclusion of Chattopadhyaya he says, "To argue... for an archaic agricultural-matriarchal tradition of mother-right and a pastoral-patriarchal tradition of male dominance and then to trace in a direct one-to-one correlation of a Samkhya materialism to the former and a Vedanta idealism to the latter is clearly an oversimplification that reflects Chattopadhyaya's political ideology more than it does India's ancient cultural heritage." Concluding the review Larson avers "what begins as a refreshing anthropological methodology for studying ancient thought and culture is reduced to an ideological perspective designed to show that... private property and the state machinery are not eternal adjuncts to human existence..." and that "...the spiritualistic outlook is not innate in man".<ref>Gerald Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, pages 65-66</ref>

Johannes Quack, in his preface to the book ''Indian Atheism: A Marxist Analysis'', writes, "This book is based on the awareness that the Indian struggle for socialism today is related to the struggle for the Indian philosophical heritage."<ref name=johannes/> Chattopadhaya is, he says, convinced that an analysis of philosophical materials of India will lead, "if rightly followed," to Marxism in India. He calls the book the "most powerful ideological weapon" to "destroy the fiction of Indian wisdom being essentially God oriented.".<ref name=johannes>J Quack (2011), Disenchanting India: Organized Rationalism and Criticism of Religion in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199812608}}, page 15</ref> Reviewing the same book Dale Riepe calls it the most complete study of its kind; "its special importance lies in its iconoclasm toppling the idols of European and Indian accounts of early Indian religion and philosophy". He notes that the book ends with "another 140 pages of text with staggering load of argument that will make rationalists and theists alike somewhat dizzy".<ref name=riepereview>Dale M. Riepe (1970), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2105752 Reviewed Work: Indian Atheism (A Marxist Analysis)] by Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 31, No. 2, pages. 304-306</ref> Noticing that Chattopadhyaya's book is markedly different from the mainstream scholarship on Indian philosophy he calls it "a work almost unique in the history of Indian philosophy".<ref name=riepereview/>

In his book ''Indian Philosophy Since Independence'', Dale Riepe calls Debiprasad's ''Lokayata'' "a work of originality and world significance...a fully-founded work showing the philosophical implications of historical considerations."<ref>Dale Riepe (1979), Indian Philosophy since Independence, John Benjamins Publishing, {{ISBN|978-9060321133}}, page 229</ref> Chattopadhyaya is a proponent of historical and dialectical materialism, writes Riepe, and Chattopadhyaya's book, according to Riepe, is a classic.<ref>Dale Riepe (1979), Indian Philosophy since Independence, John Benjamins Publishing, {{ISBN|978-9060321133}}, page 230</ref> Giving an overview of Debiprasad's other books Riepe writes, "These indications of the herculean efforts of Debiprasad are earnest tokens of his awareness of the great work still to be done for Indian philosophy. Although he has planted almost alone in the Indian fields, others are slowly harvesting the results at home and abroad where his renown is exceeding many of the leading idealists".<ref>Dale Riepe (1979), Indian Philosophy since Independence, John Benjamins Publishing, {{ISBN|978-9060321133}}, page 244</ref>

According to Chattopadhyaya, states Riepe, "Buddha looked backwards to the tribal collectives and wanted to revive... the imaginary substance of the tribe...".<ref>Dale Riepe (1979), Indian Philosophy since Independence, John Benjamins Publishing, {{ISBN|978-9060321133}}, page 231</ref> According to Dale Riepe, "Chattopadhyaya claims most of the ancient Indian traditional philosophers were atheists",<ref>Dale Riepe (1979), Indian Philosophy since Independence, John Benjamins Publishing, {{ISBN|978-9060321133}}, page 37</ref>  and contrasting the approach taken by Debiprasad with the approach taken by followers of modern Western idealism like S.N. Dasgupta, Riepe writes: {{Blockquote|Debiprasad's approach here is based on anthropological and archaeological findings, in sharp contrast to the mythopoeic constructions of the revivalists and Indian philosophers following the lead of modern Western idealism. Debiprasad's approach, in contrast to his teacher, Surendranath Dasgupta, is not simply ideological, conceptual and literary, as fine a work as Dasgupta has achieved, it is bound to the idealistic viewpoint even when he uses important physical data. Debiprasad stresses the need to establish the historical account of Indian thought on the basis of an objective and scientific approach. This implies the use of all relevant scientific methods and scientific knowledge in order to explain the rise of Indian philosophy and interpret its significance in the history of India.<ref>Dale Riepe (1979), Indian Philosophy since Independence, John Benjamins Publishing, {{ISBN|978-9060321133}}, page 232</ref>}}

The various publications of Chattopadhyaya on [[Carvaka|Carvaka/Lokayata]] have been praised as pioneering and important contributions to the studies by Ramakrishna Bhattacharya. However, Bhattacharya also questions Chattopadhyaya analysis. For example, Ramkrishna Bhattacharya states, "Chattopadhyaya did not deny Ajita Kesakambali was a materialist, but chose to emphasize that 'Ajita was no less a philosopher of futility and moral collapse than the [[Buddha]], [[Mahavira]], [[Purana]] and [[Pakudha]] [...]". Bhattacharya notes that "Chattopadhyaya  brands Ajita's teachings as a philosophy of the graveyard".<ref name=bhattacharya>Ramkrishna Bhattacharya (2011), Studies on the Carvaka/Lokayata, Anthem Press, {{ISBN|978-0857284334}}, page 27 with footnote 31, 67-76</ref>

Chattopadhyaya's rational reconstruction of the history of Indian materialism in ''Lokayata: A Study in Ancient Indian Materialism'' and other texts, was one of the most significant contributions, states Rajendra Prasad.<ref name=prasad/> Chattopadhyaya's pursuit, notes Prasad, was "a result of much of his commitment to values of scholarship" as to the "communist movement" in India. His efforts to explain materialism and atheism in Indian philosophy in its antiquity, against the old fashioned conception that India was and is the land of dreamers and mystics, required "tremendous intellectual courage", yet "Chattopadhyaya never flinched in the face of isolation in his own profession".<ref name=prasad>Rajendra Prasad (1993), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3517821 Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya], Social Scientist, Vol. 21, No. 5/6, pages 102-105</ref>

Endorsing the book ''Lokayata'' [[Joseph Needham]] wrote: "Your book will have a truly treasured place on my shelves. It is truly extraordinary that we should have approached ancient Chinese and ancient Indian civilisations with such similar results...."<ref name = "Chattopadhyay">{{cite book|title=Lokayata:A study in Ancient Indian Materialism|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|pages= back cover|year=1959}}</ref> About Chattopadhayay's 1977 book, ''Science and Society in Ancient India'', he said: "I feel that you have entirely proved your case that the Caraka-samhita and the [[Susruta Samhita|Susruta-samhita]] have an ambiguous character, which, when dissected, reveals the intense struggle between the theological philosophers on the one hand, and the doctors who strove for a truly scientific view of the world, on the other. It is unmistakably a chapter in the 'warfare of science with religion'...I do feel that your philological and philosophical analysis has been here a really splendid contribution."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Needham|first1=Joseph|title=Science and Society in Ancient India|url=http://www.kpbagchi.com/index.php/browse/products/science-and-society-in-ancient-india-detail|website=kpbagchi.com|publisher=K.P. Bagchi and Company|access-date=10 July 2015|quote=Publisher's website citing the book's blurb}}</ref>

Commenting on Chattopadhyaya's book ''Lokayata'', [[Louis Renou]] wrote: "The book is of definite value and deserves to be carefully studied by Indologists and sociologists."<ref>{{cite book|title=Lokayata:A study in Ancient Indian Materialism|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|pages=back cover|year=1959}}</ref>

Eli Franco called Chattopadhyaya's work on the history of Indian philosophy "Marxist science fiction," noting, among other things, Chattopadhyaya's ignorance of the materialism of [[Jayarashi Bhatta]], the great Indian skeptic.<ref>Eli Franco, Perception Knowledge and Disbelief, p. XII</ref>
