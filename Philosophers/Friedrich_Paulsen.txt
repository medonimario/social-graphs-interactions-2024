'''Friedrich Paulsen''' ({{IPA|de|ˈpaʊlzən|lang}}; July 16, 1846 – August 14, 1908) was a German [[Neo-Kantian]] [[philosopher]] and [[educator]].

==Biography==
He was born at [[Langenhorn (Nordfriesland)|Langenhorn]] ([[Schleswig]]) and educated at the [[Gymnasium Christianeum]], the [[University of Erlangen]], and the [[University of Berlin]]. He completed his [[doctoral thesis]] under [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg]] at Berlin in 1871, he [[Habilitation|habilitated]] there in 1875, and he became extraordinary professor of [[philosophy]] and [[pedagogy]] there in 1878. In 1896 he succeeded [[Eduard Zeller]] as professor of [[moral philosophy]] at Berlin.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was the greatest of the pupils of [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]], to whose doctrine of [[panpsychism]] he gave great prominence by his ''Einleitung in die Philosophie'' (1892; 7th ed., 1900; Eng. trans., 1895). He went, however, considerably beyond Fechner in attempting to give an [[epistemological]] account of the knowledge of the [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]]. Admitting [[Immanuel Kant]]'s hypothesis that by inner sense we are conscious of [[mental states]] only, he holds that this consciousness constitutes a knowledge of the [[thing-in-itself]] which Kant denies. Soul is, therefore, a practical reality which Paulsen, with [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], regards as known by the act of [[Will (philosophy)|will]]. But this will is neither [[rational]] [[desire]], [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] [[irrational]] will, nor [[conscious]] [[intelligent]] will, but an [[instinct]], a will to live (''Zielstrebigkeit''), often [[subconscious]], pursuing [[Telos|ends]], indeed, but without [[reasoning]] as to [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|means]]. This conception of will, though consistent and convenient to the main thesis, must be rigidly distinguished from the ordinary significance of will, i.e. rational desire.<ref>Concerning [[Will (sociology)|will]], he did influence namely his student and later friend, the German founder of [[sociology]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]].</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Paulsen was a proponent of [[hylozoism]], stating it is “a conception which almost irresistibly forces itself upon modern biology."<ref>{{cite book |title=Panpsychism in the West |date=2017 |publisher=MIT Press |page=13 |author = [[David Skrbina]]}}</ref>

Paulsen is almost better known for his educational writings than as a pure philosopher, including his ''German Education, Past and Present'' (Eng. trans., by I. Lorenz, 1907).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
