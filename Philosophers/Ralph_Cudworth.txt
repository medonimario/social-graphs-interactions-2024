===Commonwealth and Restoration===
Cudworth emerged as a central figure among that circle of theologians and philosophers known as the [[Cambridge Platonists]], who were (more or less) in sympathy with the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]: during the later 1650s, Cudworth was consulted by [[John Thurloe]], [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s Secretary to the [[English Council of State|Council of State]], with regard to certain university and government appointments and various other matters.<ref>T.

===Later life===
In 1665, Cudworth almost quarrelled with his fellow-[[Platonism|Platonist]], [[Henry More]], because of the latter's composition of an ethical work which Cudworth feared would interfere with his own long-contemplated treatise on the same subject.<ref>'Life of Cudworth, Appendix B: Letters of Cudworth and More', in Scott, ''An Introduction to Cudworth's Treatise'', [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015014300878;view=1up;seq=40 pp. 24–28] (Hathi Trust).</ref> To avoid any difficulties, More published his ''Enchiridion ethicum'' (1666–69), in [[Latin]];<ref>''An Account of Virtue; or, Dr. Henry More's Abridgement of Morals, put into English'' (transl.

==Philosophy==
Cudworth was a member of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], a group of English seventeenth-century thinkers associated with the University of Cambridge who were stimulated by Plato's teachings but also were aware of and influenced by Descartes, Hobbes, Bacon, Boyle and Spinoza. The other important philosopher of this group was Henry More (1614–1687). More held that spiritual substance or mind controlled inert matter. Out of his correspondence with Descartes, he developed the idea that everything, whether material or non, had extension, an example of the latter being space, which is infinite (Newton) and which then is correlative to the idea of God (set out in his Enchiridion metaphysicum 1667). In developing this idea, More also introduced a causal agent between God and substance, or Nature, in his Hylarchic Principle, derived from Plato's ''anima mundi'' or world soul, and the [[Pneuma (Stoic)|Stoic's pneuma]], which encapsulates the laws of nature, both for inert and vital nature, and involves a sympathetic resonance between soul (''psyche'') and body (''soma'').<ref name=Stanford>{{cite web|last=Stanford U. Encyc. of Philosophy|title=The Cambridge Platonists|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cambridge-platonists/|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref>

=== Plastic principle ===
The role of nature was one faced by philosophers in the Age of Reason or Enlightenment. The prevailing view was either that of the Church of a personal deity intervening in his creation, producing miracles, or an ancient pantheism (atheism relative to theism) – deity pervading all things and existing in all things. However, the "ideas of an all-embracing providential care of the world and of one universal vital force capable of organizing the world from within."<ref name=Giglioni>{{cite journal|last=Giglioni|first=Guido|title=The cosmoplastic system of the universe: Ralph Cudworth on Stoic naturalism|journal=Revue d'histoire des sciences|year=2008|volume=Tome 61/2|issue=2 |pages=313–331|doi=10.3917/rhs.612.0313 |url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-revue-d-histoire-des-sciences-2008-2-page-313.htm}}</ref>  presented difficulties for philosophers of a spiritual as well as materialistic bent.

Cudworth countered these mechanical, materialistic views of nature in his ''True intellectual system of the universe'' (1678), with the idea of 'the Plastick Life of Nature', a formative principle that contains both substance and the laws of motion, as well as a nisus or direction that accounts for design and goal in the natural world. He was stimulated by the Cartesian idea of the mind as self-consciousness to see God as consciousness. He first analysed four forms of atheism from ancient times to present, and showed that all misunderstood the principle of life and knowledge, which involved unsentient activity and self-consciousness, addressing the tension between theism and atheism, took both the Stoic idea of Divine Reason poured into the world, and the Platonic idea of the world soul (''[[anima mundi]]'') to posit a power that was polaric – "either as a ruling but separate mind or as an informing vital principle – either nous hypercosmios or nous enkosmios.<ref name=Giglioni />

:It is in connection with the refutation of hylozoic atheism that he brings forward the celebrated hypothesis, which he held in common with More, of a plastic nature,—a substance intermediate between matter and spirit,—a power which prosecutes certain ends but not freely or intelligently,—an instrument by which laws are able to act without the immediate agency of God...<ref name="1902 Encyc.">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=1902|title=Ralph Cudworth|url=http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/C/CUD/ralph-cudworth.html|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref>
All of the atheistic approaches posited nature as unconscious, which for Cudworth was ontologically unsupportable, as a principle that was supposed to be the ultimate source of life and meaning could only be itself self-conscious and knowledgeable, that is, rational, otherwise creation or nature degenerates into inert matter set in motion by random external forces (Coleridge's 'chance whirlings of unproductive particles'). Cudworth saw nature as a vegetative power endowed with plastic (forming) and spermatic (generative) forces, but one with Mind, or a self-conscious knowledge. This idea would later emerge in the Romantic period in German science as [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Blumenbach's ''Bildungstreib'']] (generative power) and the ''Lebenskraft'' (or ''Bildungskraft'').

:...the life of the universe splits into two principles&nbsp;– the one transcendent and intellectual (« an animalish, sentient and intellectual nature, or a conscious soul and mind, that presided over the whole world »), the other immanent and devoid of perception (« a certain plastic nature, or spermatic principle which was properly the fate of all things »)<ref name=Giglioni />

The essence of atheism for Cudworth was the view that matter was self-active and self-sufficient, whereas for Cudworth the plastic power was unsentient and under the direct control of the universal Mind or ''Logos''. For him atheism, whether mechanical or material could not solve the "phenomenon of nature." Henry More argued that atheism made each substance independent and self-acting such that it 'deified' matter. Cudworth argued that materialism/mechanism reduced "substance to a corporeal entity, its activity to causal determinism, and each single thing to fleeting appearances in a system dominated by material necessity."<ref name=Giglioni />

Cudworth had the idea of a general plastic nature of the world, containing natural laws to keep all of nature, inert and vital in orderly motion, and particular plastic natures in particular entities, which serve as 'Inward Principles' of growth and motion, but ascribes it to the Platonic tradition:
:The Platonists seem to affirm both these together, namely that there is a Plastick Nature lodged in all particular Souls of Animals, Brutes, and Men, and also that there is a Plastick or Spermatick Principle of the whole Universe distinct from the Higher Mundane Soul, though subordinate to it.(Cudworth, TIS, p. 165)<ref name=Smith>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Justin E. H.|title=The Leibnizian Organism Between Cudworth's Plastic Natures and Locke's Thinking Matter|url=http://www.bib.umontreal.ca/colloqueNE/textes_des_communications/Smith.pdf|publisher=Concordia University, Montreal|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref>
Further, Cudsworth's plastic principle was also a functional polarity. As he wrote:
:The Seminary Reason or Plastick Nature of the Universe opposing the Parts to one another and making them severally Indigent, produces by that means War and Contention. And therefore though it be One, yet notwithstanding it consists of Different and Contrary things. For there being Hostility in its Parts, it is nevertheless Friendly and Agreeable in the Whole; after the same manner as in a Dramatick Poem, Clashings and Contentions are reconciled into one Harmony. And therefore the Seminary or Plastick Nature of the World, may fitly be resembled to the Harmony of Disagreeing things.<ref name=Raiger>{{cite journal|last=Raiger|first=Michael|title=The Intellectual Breeze, the Corporeality of Thought, and the Eolian Harp|journal=Coleridge Bulletin|date=Winter 2002|series=New Series|issue=20|pages=76–84|url=http://www.friendsofcoleridge.com/MembersOnly/CB20Raiger.htm|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref>

As another historian notes in conclusion, "Cudworth’s theory of plastic natures is offered as an alternative to the interpretation of all of nature as either governed by blind chance, or, on his understanding of the Malebranchean view, as micro-managed by God."<ref name="Smith"/>

==== Plastic Principle and mind ====
Cudworth's plastic principle also involves a theory of mind that is active, that is, God or the Supreme Mind is "the spermatic reason" which gives rise to individual mind and reason. Human mind can also create, and has access to spiritual or super-sensible 'Ideas' in the Platonic sense.<ref name="Stanford"/> Cudworth challenged Hobbesian determinism in arguing that will is not distinct from reason, but a power to act that is internal, and therefore, the voluntary will function involves self-determination, not external compulsion, though we have the power to act either in accordance with God's will or not. Cudworth's 'hegemonikon' (taken from Stoicism) is a function within the soul that combines the higher functions of the soul (voluntary will and reason) on the one hand with the lower animal functions (instinct), and also constitutes the whole person, thus bridging the Cartesian dualism of body and soul or ''psyche'' and ''soma''. This idea provided the basis for a concept of self-awareness and identity of an individual that is self-directed and autonomous, an idea that anticipates John Locke.

== Legacy  ==
Locke examined how man came to knowledge via stimulus (rather than seeing ideas as inherent), which approach led to his idea of the 'thinking' mind, which is both receptive and pro-active. The first involves receiving sensations ('simple ideas') and the second by reflection – "observation of its own inner operations" (inner sense which leads to complex ideas), with the second activity acting upon the first. Thought is set in motion by outer stimuli which 'simple ideas' are taken up by the mind's self-activity, an "active power" such that the outer world can only be real-ized as action (natural cause) by the activity of consciousness. Locke also took the issue of life as lying not in substance but in the capacity of the self for consciousness, to be able to organize (associate) disparate events, that is to participate life by means of the [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]s, which have the capacity to produce every kind of experience in consciousness. These ideas of Locke were taken over by Fichte and influenced German Romantic science and medicine. (See [[Romantic medicine]] and [[Brunonian system of medicine]]).
[[Thomas Reid]] and his "Common Sense" philosophy, was also influenced by Cudworth, taking his influence into the Scottish Enlightenment.<ref name="Stanford"/>

George Berkeley later developed the idea of a plastic life principle with his idea of an 'aether' or 'aetherial medium' that causes 'vibrations' that animate all living beings. For Berkeley, it is the very nature of this medium that generates the 'attractions' of entities to each other.

:The refraction of light is also thought to proceed from the different density and elastic force of this æthereal medium in different places. The vibrations of this medium, alternately concurring with or obstructing the motions of the rays of light, are supposed to produce the fits of easy reflection and transmission. Light by the vibrations of this medium is thought to communicate heat to bodies. Animal motion and sensation are also accounted for by the vibrating motions of this æthereal medium, propagated through the solid capillaments of the nerves. In a word, all the phenomena and properties of bodies that were before attributed to attraction, upon later thoughts seem ascribed to this æther, together with the various attractions themselves. (Berkeley V 107–8)<ref name="Raiger"/>

Berkeley meant this 'aether' to supplant Newton's gravity as the cause of motion (neither seeing the polarity involved between two forces, as Cudworth had in his plastic principle). However, in Berkeley's conception, aether is both the movement of spirit and the motion of nature.

Both Cudworth's views and those of Berkeley were taken up by Coleridge in his metaphor of the eolian harp in his 'Effusion XXXV' as one commentator noted: "what we see in the first manuscript is the articulation of Cudworth’s principle of plastic nature, which is then transformed in the published version into a Berkeleyan expression of the causal agency of motion performed by God’s immanent activity."<ref name="Raiger"/>

==Works==
{{Portal|Christianity}}

===Sermons and Treatises===
Cudworth's works included ''The Union of Christ and the Church, in a Shadow'' (1642); ''A Sermon preached before the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]]'' (1647); and ''A Discourse concerning the True Notion of the Lord's Supper'' (1670). Much of Cudworth's work remains in manuscript. However, certain surviving works have been published posthumously, such as ''A Treatise concerning eternal and immutable Morality, and A Treatise of Freewill. ''

====''A Treatise concerning eternal and immutable Morality'' (posth.)====
Cudworth's ''Treatise on eternal and immutable Morality'', published with a preface by [[Edward Chandler (bishop)|Edward Chandler]] (1731),<ref>R. Cudworth, ''Treatise Concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality... with a Preface by... Edward Lord Bishop of Durham'' [https://archive.org/stream/treatiseconcerni00cudw#page/n5/mode/2up (1st edn, James and John Knapton: London, 1731)]</ref> is about the historical development of British moral philosophy. It answers, from the standpoint of [[Platonism]], Hobbes's famous doctrine that moral distinctions are created by the state. It argues that just as knowledge contains a permanent intelligible element over and above the flux of sense-impressions, so there exist eternal and immutable ideas of morality.<ref name=EB1911/>

====''A Treatise of Freewill'' (posth.)====
Another posthumous publication was Cudworth's ''A Treatise of Freewill'', edited by [[Chaplain of King's College London|John Allen]] (1838). Both this and the ''Treatise on eternal and immutable Morality'' are connected with the design of his ''magnum opus'', ''The True Intellectual System of the Universe''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ralph Cudworth|title=Ralph Cudworth: A Treatise Concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality: With A Treatise of Freewill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZiig6ljKSoC&pg=PA219|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47918-9|page=219|editor=S. Hutton}}</ref>

===''The True Intellectual System of the Universe'' (1678)===
In 1678, Cudworth published ''The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the first part, wherein all the reason and philosophy of atheism is confuted and its impossibility demonstrated'', which had been given an [[Imprimatur]] for publication (29 May 1671).

[[File:The True Intellectual System of the Universe -bound with another text by Cudworth- 2 vols - Upper cover (Davis187).jpg|thumb|right|A finely-bound first edition of the ''True Intellectual System'' (1678) in the British Library (shelfmark: Davis 187).]] 
The ''Intellectual System'' arose, according to Cudworth, from a discourse refuting "fatal necessity", or [[determinism]].<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cudworth, Ralph| volume=7| pages=612–613 |last= Sturt |first= Henry |author-link= Henry Sturt}}</ref> Enlarging his plan, he proposed to prove three matters:
:(a) the [[existence of God]];
:(b) the naturalness of moral distinctions; and
:(c) the reality of human [[Free will|freedom]].

These three comprise, collectively, the intellectual (as opposed to the physical) system of the universe; and they are opposed, respectively, by three false principles: atheism, religious fatalism (which refers all moral distinctions to the will of God), and the fatalism of the ancient [[Stoics]] (who recognized God and yet identified him with nature). Only the first part, dealing with atheism, was ever published.

Cudworth criticizes two main forms of materialistic [[atheism]]: the [[atomism|atomic]] (adopted by [[Democritus]], [[Epicurus]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]]); and the [[Hylozoism|hylozoic]] (attributed to [[Strato of Lampsacus]], which explains everything by the supposition of an inward self-organizing life in matter). Atomic atheism, to which Cudworth devotes the larger part of the work, is described as arising from the combination of two principles, neither of which is, individually, atheistic (namely atomism and corporealism, or the doctrine that nothing exists but body). The example of Stoicism, Cudworth suggests, shows that corporealism may be theistic.

Cudworth discusses the history of atomism at length. It is, in its purely physical application, a theory that he fully accepts. He holds that theistic atomism was taught by [[Pythagoras]], [[Empedocles]] and many other ancient philosophers, and was only perverted to atheism by Democritus. Cudworth believes that atomism was first invented before the [[Trojan war]] by a [[Sidon]]ian thinker named Moschus or [[Mochus]] (whom he identifies with [[Moses]] in the [[Old Testament]]).

Cudworth's method in arranging his work was to marshal the atheistic arguments elaborately before refuting them in his final chapter. This led many readers to accuse Cudworth himself of atheism – as [[John Dryden]] remarked, "he has raised such objections against the being of a God and Providence that many think he has not answered them".<ref>{{cite book |last=Scott |first=W. R. |date=1891 |chapter=The Life of Ralph Cudworth |title=An Introduction to Cudworth's Treatise |location=London |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ARxLAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA15 |pages=15–17}}</ref> Much attention was also attached to a subordinate matter in the book, the conception of the "Plastic Medium" (a revival of [[Plato]]'s "[[Anima mundi|World-Soul]]") which was intended to explain the existence and laws of nature without referring to the direct operation of God. This theory occasioned a long-drawn controversy between [[Pierre Bayle]] and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc]], with the former maintaining, and the latter denying, that the Plastic Medium is favourable to atheism.

Summing up the work, [[Andrew Dickson White]] wrote in 1896:

<blockquote>
To this day he [Cudworth] remains, in breadth of scholarship, in strength of thought, in tolerance, and in honesty, one of the greatest glories of the English Church ... He purposed to build a fortress which should protect Christianity against all dangerous theories of the universe, ancient or modern ... While genius marked every part of it, features appeared which gave the rigidly orthodox serious misgivings. From the old theories of direct personal action on the universe by the Almighty he broke utterly. He dwelt on the action of law, rejected the continuous exercise of miraculous intervention, pointed out the fact that in the natural world there are "errors" and "bungles" and argued vigorously in favor of the origin and maintenance of the universe as a slow and gradual development of Nature in obedience to an inward principle.<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=Andrew Dickson |date=1901 |title=A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom |volume=1 |location=New York |publisher=D.
