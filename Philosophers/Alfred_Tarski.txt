Educated in Poland at the [[University of Warsaw]], and a member of the [[Lwów–Warsaw school|Lwów–Warsaw school of logic]] and the [[Warsaw school of mathematics]], he immigrated to the United States in 1939 where he became a naturalized citizen in 1945. Tarski taught and carried out research in mathematics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from 1942 until his death in 1983.<ref name=FefA>[[#FefA|Feferman A.]]</ref>

His biographers [[Anita Burdman Feferman]] and [[Solomon Feferman]] state that, "Along with his contemporary, [[Kurt Gödel]], he changed the face of logic in the twentieth century, especially through his work on the concept of [[truth]] and the theory of models."<ref name=FFintro>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], p.1</ref>

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Alfred Tarski was born Alfred Teitelbaum ([[Polish language|Polish]] spelling: "Tajtelbaum"), to parents who were [[Polish Jews]] in comfortable circumstances. He first manifested his mathematical abilities while in secondary school, at Warsaw's ''[[Szkoła Mazowiecka]]''.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], pp.17-18</ref> Nevertheless, he entered the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1918 intending to study [[biology]].<ref name="Feferman & Feferman, p.26">[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], p.26</ref>

After Poland regained independence in 1918, Warsaw University came under the leadership of [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], [[Stanisław Leśniewski]] and [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and quickly became a world-leading research institution in logic, [[foundational mathematics]], and the philosophy of mathematics. Leśniewski recognized Tarski's potential as a mathematician and encouraged him to abandon biology.<ref name="Feferman & Feferman, p.26"/>  Henceforth Tarski attended courses taught by Łukasiewicz, Sierpiński, [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]] and [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], and in 1924 became the only person ever to complete a doctorate under Leśniewski's supervision. His thesis was entitled ''O wyrazie pierwotnym logistyki'' (''On the Primitive Term of Logistic''; published 1923). Tarski and Leśniewski soon grew cool to each other, mainly due to the latter's increasing anti-semitism.<ref name="FFintro" /> However, in later life, Tarski reserved his warmest praise for Kotarbiński, which was reciprocated.

In 1923, Alfred Teitelbaum and his brother Wacław changed their surname to "Tarski". The Tarski brothers also converted to [[Roman Catholicism]], Poland's dominant religion. Alfred did so even though he was an avowed [[atheism|atheist]].<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], p.294</ref><ref>"Most of the Socialist Party members were also in favor of assimilation, and Tarski's political allegiance was socialist at the time. So, along with its being a practical move, becoming more Polish than Jewish was an ideological statement and was approved by many, though not all, of his colleagues. As to why Tarski, a professed atheist, converted, that just came with the territory and was part of the package: if you were going to be Polish then you had to say you were Catholic." Anita Burdman Feferman, Solomon Feferman, ''Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic'' (2004), page 39.</ref>

===Career===
After becoming the youngest person ever to complete a doctorate at Warsaw University, Tarski taught logic at the Polish Pedagogical Institute, mathematics and logic at the university, and served as Łukasiewicz's assistant. Because these positions were poorly paid, Tarski also taught mathematics at the Third Boys’ Gimnazjum of the Trade Union of Polish Secondary-School Teachers (later the Stefan Żeromski Gimnazjum), a Warsaw secondary school, beginning in 1925.<ref>{{cite book

Hence until his departure for the United States in 1939, Tarski not only wrote several textbooks and many papers, a number of them ground-breaking, but also did so while supporting himself primarily by teaching high-school mathematics.{{sfn|McFarland|McFarland|Smith|2014|p=319}} In 1929 Tarski married fellow teacher Maria Witkowska, a Pole of Catholic background. She had worked as a courier for the army in the [[Polish–Soviet War]]. They had two children; a son [[Jan Tarski,]] who became a physicist, and a daughter Ina, who married the mathematician [[Andrzej Ehrenfeucht]].<ref>Feferman & Feferman (2004), pp. 239–242.</ref>

Tarski applied for a chair of philosophy at [[Lwów University]], but on [[Bertrand Russell]]'s recommendation it was awarded to [[Leon Chwistek]].<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], p. 67</ref> In 1930, Tarski visited the [[University of Vienna]], lectured to [[Karl Menger]]'s colloquium, and met [[Kurt Gödel]]. Thanks to a fellowship, he was able to return to Vienna during the first half of 1935 to work with Menger's research group. From Vienna he traveled to Paris to present his ideas on truth at the first meeting of the [[Unity of Science]] movement, an outgrowth of the [[Vienna Circle]]. Tarski's academic career in Poland was strongly and repeatedly impacted by his heritage. For example, in 1937, Tarski applied for a chair at [[Poznań University]] but the chair was abolished to avoid assigning it to Tarski (who was undisputedly the strongest applicant) because he was a Jew.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], pp. 102-103</ref> Tarski's ties to the Unity of Science movement likely saved his life, because they resulted in his being invited to address the Unity of Science Congress held in September 1939 at [[Harvard University]]. Thus he left Poland in August 1939, on the last ship to sail from Poland for the United States before the German and Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] and the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Tarski left reluctantly, because Leśniewski had died a few months before, creating a vacancy which Tarski hoped to fill. Oblivious to the [[Nazi]] threat, he left his wife and children in Warsaw. He did not see them again until 1946. During the war, nearly all his Jewish extended family were murdered at the hands of the German occupying authorities.

Once in the United States, Tarski held a number of temporary teaching and research positions: Harvard University (1939), [[City College of New York]] (1940), and thanks to a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] (1942), where he again met Gödel. In 1942, Tarski joined the Mathematics Department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he spent the rest of his career. Tarski became an American citizen in 1945.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], Chap. 5, pp. 124-149</ref> Although emeritus from 1968, he taught until 1973 and supervised Ph.D. candidates until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb4d5nb20m&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00159&toc.depth=1&toc.id=|title=Alfred Tarski, Mathematics: Berkeley|author1=Robert Vaught|author2=John Addison|author3=Benson Mates|author4=Julia Robinson |year=1985|publisher=University of California (System) Academic Senate|access-date=2008-12-26}}</ref> At Berkeley, Tarski acquired a reputation as an astounding and demanding teacher, a fact noted by many observers:

{{blockquote|His seminars at Berkeley quickly became famous in the world of mathematical logic. His students, many of whom became distinguished mathematicians, noted the awesome energy with which he would coax and cajole their best work out of them, always demanding the highest standards of clarity and precision.<ref>[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Obits/Tarski.html Obituary in ''Times'', reproduced here]</ref>}}

{{blockquote|Tarski was extroverted, quick-witted, strong-willed, energetic, and sharp-tongued. He preferred his research to be collaborative — sometimes working all night with a colleague — and was very fastidious about priority.<ref>Gregory Moore, "Alfred Tarski" in ''[[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]''</ref>}}

{{blockquote|A charismatic leader and teacher, known for his brilliantly precise yet suspenseful expository style, Tarski had intimidatingly high standards for students, but at the same time he could be very encouraging, and particularly so to women — in contrast to the general trend. Some students were frightened away, but a circle of disciples remained, many of whom became world-renowned leaders in the field.<ref>[[#Fef|Feferman]]</ref>}}

Tarski supervised twenty-four Ph.D. dissertations including (in chronological order) those of [[Andrzej Mostowski]], [[Bjarni Jónsson]], [[Julia Robinson]], [[Robert Vaught]], [[Solomon Feferman]], [[Richard Montague]], [[James Donald Monk]], [[Haim Gaifman]], [[Donald Pigozzi]], and [[Roger Maddux]], as well as [[Chen Chung Chang]] and [[Jerome Keisler]], authors of ''Model Theory'' (1973),<ref>Chang, C.C., and Keisler, H.J., 1973.

Five of Tarski's students were women, a remarkable fact given that men represented an overwhelming majority of graduate students at the time.<ref name=studentlist/> However, he had extra-marital affairs with at least two of these students. After he showed another of his female student's{{who|date=July 2023}} work to a male colleague{{who|date=July 2023}}, the colleague published it himself, leading her to leave the graduate study and later move to a different university and a different advisor.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], pp. 177–178 and 197–201.</ref>

Tarski lectured at [[University College, London]] (1950, 1966), the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris (1955), the [[Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science]] in Berkeley (1958&ndash;60), the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (1967), and the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] (1974&ndash;75). Among many distinctions garnered over the course of his career, Tarski was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], the [[British Academy]] and the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1958,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00003268 |title=Alfred Tarski (1902 - 1983) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=17 July 2015}}</ref> received [[honorary degree]]s from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in 1975, from [[Marseilles]]' [[Paul Cézanne University]] in 1977 and from the [[University of Calgary]], as well as the Berkeley Citation in 1981. Tarski presided over the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]], 1944&ndash;46, and the International Union for the History and Philosophy of Science, 1956&ndash;57. He was also an honorary editor of ''[[Algebra Universalis]]''.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Tarski}}</ref>

==Work in mathematics==
Tarski's mathematical interests were exceptionally broad. His collected papers run to about 2,500 pages, most of them on mathematics, not logic. For a concise survey of Tarski's mathematical and logical accomplishments by his former student Solomon Feferman, see "Interludes I&ndash;VI" in Feferman and Feferman.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], pp. 43-52, 69-75, 109-123, 189-195, 277-287, 334-342</ref>

Tarski's first paper, published when he was 19 years old, was on [[set theory]], a subject to which he returned throughout his life.<ref name="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk">{{Cite web |url=https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Tarski/#:~:text=Tarski%27s%20first%20paper%20was%20published%20in%201921%20when,submitted%20his%20doctoral%20thesis%20for%20examination%20in%201923. |title=Alfred Tarski |website=mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk |access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref> In 1924, he and [[Stefan Banach]] proved that, if one accepts the [[Axiom of Choice]], a [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] can be cut into a finite number of pieces, and then reassembled into a ball of larger size, or alternatively it can be reassembled into two balls whose sizes each equal that of the original one. This result is now called the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]].<ref>{{Cite arXiv |title=The Banach-Tarski Paradox |author=Katie Buchhorn |date=8 August 2012 |class=math.HO |eprint=2108.05714 }}</ref>

In ''A decision method for elementary algebra and geometry'', Tarski showed, by the method of [[quantifier elimination]], that the [[first-order theory]] of the [[real number]]s under addition and multiplication is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]. (While this result appeared only in 1948, it dates back to 1930 and was mentioned in Tarski (1931).) This is a very curious result, because [[Alonzo Church]] proved in 1936 that [[Peano arithmetic]] (the theory of [[natural number]]s) is ''not'' decidable. Peano arithmetic is also incomplete by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. In his 1953 ''Undecidable theories'', Tarski et al. showed that many mathematical systems, including [[lattice theory]], abstract [[projective geometry]], and [[closure algebra]]s, are all undecidable. The theory of [[Abelian group]]s is decidable, but that of non-Abelian groups is not.

While teaching at the Stefan Żeromski Gimnazjum in the 1920s and 30s, Tarski often taught [[geometry]].{{sfn|McFarland|McFarland|Smith|2014|loc=Section 9.2: Teaching geometry, pp. 179–184}} Using some ideas of [[Mario Pieri]], in 1926 Tarski devised an original [[axiomatization]] for plane [[Euclidean geometry]], one considerably more concise than [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert's]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1785/F2.pdf |title=Tarski's Geometry and the Euclidean Plane in Mizar |website=ceur-ws.org |author=Adam Grabowski |access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref> [[Tarski's axioms]] form a first-order theory devoid of set theory, whose individuals are [[Point (geometry)|points]], and having only two primitive [[finitary relation|relations]]. In 1930, he proved this theory decidable because it can be mapped into another theory he had already proved decidable, namely his first-order theory of the real numbers.

In 1929 he showed that much of Euclidean [[solid geometry]] could be recast as a second-order theory whose individuals are ''spheres'' (a [[primitive notion]]), a single primitive binary relation "is contained in", and two axioms that, among other things, imply that containment [[partial order|partially orders]] the spheres. Relaxing the requirement that all individuals be spheres yields a formalization of [[mereology]] far easier to exposit than [[Lesniewski]]'s variant. Near the end of his life, Tarski wrote a very long letter, published as Tarski and Givant (1999), summarizing his work on geometry.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Tarski's System of Geometry |journal=The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic |doi=10.2307/421089 |jstor=421089 |s2cid=18551419 |last1=Tarski |first1=Alfred |last2=Givant |first2=Steven |year=1999 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=175–214 }}</ref>

''Cardinal Algebras'' studied algebras whose models include the arithmetic of [[cardinal number]]s. ''Ordinal Algebras'' sets out an algebra for the additive theory of [[order type]]s. Cardinal, but not ordinal, addition commutes.

In 1941, Tarski published an important paper on [[binary relation]]s, which began the work on [[relation algebra]] and its [[metamathematics]] that occupied Tarski and his students for much of the balance of his life. While that exploration (and the closely related work of [[Roger Lyndon]]) uncovered some important limitations of relation algebra, Tarski also showed (Tarski and Givant 1987) that relation algebra can express most [[axiomatic set theory]] and [[Peano arithmetic]]. For an introduction to [[relation algebra]], see Maddux (2006). In the late 1940s, Tarski and his students devised [[cylindric algebra]]s, which are to [[first-order logic]] what the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] is to classical [[sentential logic]]. This work culminated in the two monographs by Tarski, Henkin, and Monk (1971, 1985).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://goodmancoaching.nl/tarskis-convention-t-and-inductive-definition/ |title=Tarski's convention-T and inductive definition? |website=goodmancoaching.nl |date=22 May 2022 |access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref>

==Work in logic==
Tarski's student, [[Robert Lawson Vaught]], has ranked Tarski as one of the four greatest logicians of all time &mdash; along with [[Aristotle]], [[Gottlob Frege]], and [[Kurt Gödel]].<ref name=FFintro/><ref name="Vaught">{{cite journal|last=Vaught|first=Robert L.|date=Dec 1986|title=Alfred Tarski's Work in Model Theory|journal=[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]|volume=51|issue=4|pages=869–882|doi=10.2307/2273900|jstor=2273900|s2cid=27153078 }}</ref><ref name="Restall">{{cite web|url=http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/|title=Great Moments in Logic |last=Restall|first=Greg|date=2002–2006|access-date=2009-01-03| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206052240/http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/| archive-date= 6 December 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> <!-- Of these four, he was by far the most prolific author. MORE THAN ARISTOTLE???  PROVIDE Reference! --> However, Tarski often expressed great admiration for [[Logic of relatives|Charles Sanders Peirce]], particularly for his pioneering work in the [[Finitary relation|logic of relations]].

Tarski produced axioms for ''logical consequence'' and worked on [[deductive system]]s, the algebra of logic, and the theory of definability. His semantic methods, which culminated in the model theory he and a number of his Berkeley students developed in the 1950s and 60s, radically transformed Hilbert's proof-theoretic metamathematics.
Around 1930, Tarski developed an abstract theory of logical deductions that models some properties of logical calculi. Mathematically, what he described is just a finitary closure operator on a set (the set of ''sentences'').  In [[abstract algebraic logic]], finitary closure operators are still studied under the name ''consequence operator'', which was coined by Tarski. The set ''S'' represents a set of sentences, a subset ''T'' of ''S'' a theory, and cl(''T'') is the set of all sentences that follow from the theory. This abstract approach was applied to fuzzy logic (see Gerla 2000).
{{blockquote|In [Tarski's] view, metamathematics became similar to any mathematical discipline. Not only can its concepts and results be mathematized, but they actually can be integrated into mathematics. ... Tarski destroyed the borderline between metamathematics and mathematics. He objected to restricting the role of metamathematics to the foundations of mathematics.<ref name="Sinaceur">{{cite journal|last=Sinaceur|first=Hourya|title=Alfred Tarski: Semantic Shift, Heuristic Shift in Metamathematics|journal=Synthese|volume=126|issue=1–2|pages=49–65|issn=0039-7857|doi=10.1023/A:1005268531418|year=2001|s2cid=28783841|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01119489}}</ref>}}

Tarski's 1936 article "On the concept of logical consequence" argued that the conclusion of an argument will follow logically from its premises if and only if every model of the premises is a model of the conclusion.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Tarski on Logical Consequence |journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic |year=1996 |doi=10.1305/ndjfl/1040067321 |s2cid=13217777 |last1=Gómez-Torrente |first1=Mario |volume=37 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In 1937, he published a paper presenting clearly his views on the nature and purpose of the deductive method, and the role of logic in scientific studies.<ref name="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk"/> His high school and undergraduate teaching on logic and axiomatics culminated in a classic short text, published first in Polish, then in German translation, and finally in a 1941 English translation as ''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.471634 |title=Introduction To Logic And To The Methodology Of Deductive Sciences |website=archive.org |access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref>

Tarski's 1969 "Truth and proof" considered both [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] and [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]], and mulled over their consequences for the axiomatic method in mathematics.

===Truth in formalized languages===
{{main|Semantic theory of truth}}
In 1933, Tarski published a very long paper in Polish, titled "Pojęcie prawdy w językach nauk dedukcyjnych",<ref>Alfred Tarski, "POJĘCIE PRAWDY W JĘZYKACH NAUK DEDUKCYJNYCH", Towarszystwo Naukowe Warszawskie, Warszawa, 1933. [http://www.archiwum.wfis.uw.edu.pl/bibfis/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=129:a-tarski-pojcie-prawdy-w-jzykach-nauk-dedukcyjnych&catid=56:marginalia&Itemid=106 (Text in Polish in the Digital Library WFISUW-IFISPAN-PTF)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000353/http://www.archiwum.wfis.uw.edu.pl/bibfis/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=129:a-tarski-pojcie-prawdy-w-jzykach-nauk-dedukcyjnych&catid=56:marginalia&Itemid=106 |date=2016-03-04 }}.</ref> "Setting out a mathematical definition of truth for formal languages." The 1935 German translation was titled "Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen", "The concept of truth in formalized languages", sometimes shortened to "Wahrheitsbegriff". An English translation appeared in the 1956 first edition of the volume ''[[Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics]]''. This collection of papers from 1923 to 1938 is an event in 20th-century [[analytic philosophy]], a contribution to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[semantics]], and the [[philosophy of language]]. For a brief discussion of its content, see [[Convention T]] (and also [[T-schema]]).

A philosophical debate examines the extent to which Tarski's theory of truth for formalized languages can be seen as a [[correspondence theory of truth]]. The debate centers on how to read Tarski's condition of material adequacy for a true definition. That condition requires that the truth theory have the following as theorems for all sentences p of the language for which truth is being defined:

: "p" is true [[if and only if]] p.

(where p is the proposition expressed by "p")

The debate amounts to whether to read sentences of this form, such as

{{blockquote|"Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white}}

as expressing merely a [[deflationary theory of truth]] or as embodying [[truth]] as a more substantial property (see Kirkham 1992).

===Logical consequence===

Whether Tarski's notion was entirely the modern one turns on whether he intended to admit models with varying domains (and in particular, models with domains of different [[cardinal number|cardinalities]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2023}} This question is a matter of some debate in the philosophical literature. [[John Etchemendy]] stimulated much of the discussion about Tarski's treatment of varying domains.<ref>{{cite book|last=Etchemendy|first=John|title=The Concept of Logical Consequence|publisher=Stanford CA: CSLI Publications|year=1999|isbn=978-1-57586-194-4}}</ref>

Tarski ends by pointing out that his definition of logical consequence depends upon a division of terms into the logical and the extra-logical and he expresses some skepticism that any such objective division will be forthcoming. "What are Logical Notions?" can thus be viewed as continuing "On the Concept of Logical Consequence".{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

===Logical notions===
[[File:Alfred Tarski.jpeg|thumb|Alfred Tarski at Berkeley]]
Tarski's "What are Logical Notions?" (Tarski 1986) is the published version of a talk that he gave originally in 1966 in London and later in 1973 in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; it was edited without his direct involvement by [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]]. It became the most cited paper in the journal ''History and Philosophy of Logic''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/showMostCitedArticles?journalCode=thpl20 | title=History and Philosophy of Logic}}</ref>

In the talk, Tarski proposed demarcation of logical operations (which he calls "notions") from non-logical. The suggested criteria were derived from the [[Erlangen program]] of the 19th-century German mathematician [[Felix Klein]]. Mautner (in 1946), and possibly{{clarify|date=July 2023}} an article by the Portuguese mathematician [[José Sebastião e Silva]], anticipated Tarski in applying the Erlangen Program to logic.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

The Erlangen program classified the various types of geometry ([[Euclidean geometry]], [[affine geometry]], [[topology]], etc.) by the type of one-one transformation of space onto itself that left the objects of that geometrical theory invariant. (A one-to-one transformation is a functional map of the space onto itself so that every point of the space is associated with or mapped to one other point of the space. So, "rotate 30 degrees" and  "magnify by a factor of 2" are intuitive descriptions of simple uniform one-one transformations.) Continuous transformations give rise to the objects of topology, similarity transformations to those of Euclidean geometry, and so on.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

As the range of permissible transformations becomes broader, the range of objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by the application of the transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a [[polygon]] from an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

Tarski's proposal{{which|date=July 2023}} was to demarcate the logical notions by considering all possible one-to-one transformations ([[automorphism]]s) of a domain onto itself. By domain is meant the [[universe of discourse]] of a model for the semantic theory of logic. If one identifies the [[truth value]] True with the domain set and the truth-value False with the empty set, then the following operations are counted as logical under the proposal:

# ''[[Truth-function]]s'': All truth-functions are admitted by the proposal. This includes, but is not limited to, all ''n''-ary truth-functions for finite ''n''. (It also admits of truth-functions with any infinite number of places.)
# ''Individuals'': No individuals, provided the domain has at least two members.
# ''Predicates'':
#* the one-place total and null predicates, the former having all members of the domain in its extension and the latter having no members of the domain in its extension
#* two-place total and null predicates, the former having the set of all ordered pairs of domain members as its extension and the latter with the empty set as extension
#* the two-place identity predicate, with the set of all order-pairs <''a'',''a''> in its extension, where ''a'' is a member of the domain
#* the two-place diversity predicate, with the set of all order pairs <''a'',''b''> where ''a'' and ''b'' are distinct members of the domain
#* ''n''-ary predicates in general: all predicates definable from the identity predicate together with [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[disjunction]] and [[negation]] (up to any ordinality, finite or infinite)
# ''[[Quantifier (logic)|Quantifiers]]'': Tarski explicitly discusses only monadic quantifiers and points out that all such numerical quantifiers are admitted under his proposal. These include the standard universal and existential quantifiers as well as numerical quantifiers such as "Exactly four", "Finitely many", "Uncountably many", and "Between four and 9 million", for example. While Tarski does not enter into the issue, it is also clear that polyadic quantifiers are admitted under the proposal. These are quantifiers like, given two predicates ''Fx'' and ''Gy'', "More(''x, y'')", which says "More things have ''F'' than have ''G''."
# ''Set-Theoretic relations'': Relations such as [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[Union (set theory)|union]] applied to [[subset]]s of the domain are logical in the present sense.
# ''Set membership'': Tarski ended his lecture with a discussion of whether the set membership relation counted as logical in his sense. (Given the reduction of (most of) mathematics to set theory, this was, in effect, the question of whether most or all of mathematics is a part of logic.) He pointed out that set membership is logical if set theory is developed along the lines of [[type theory]], but is extralogical if set theory is set out axiomatically, as in the canonical [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].
# ''Logical notions of higher order'': While Tarski confined his discussion to operations of first-order logic, there is nothing about his proposal that necessarily restricts it to first-order logic. (Tarski likely restricted his attention to first-order notions as the talk was given to a non-technical audience.) So, higher-order quantifiers and predicates are admitted as well.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

In some ways the present proposal is the obverse of that of Lindenbaum and Tarski (1936), who proved that all the logical operations of  [[Bertrand Russell]]'s and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' are invariant under one-to-one transformations of the domain onto itself. The present proposal is also employed in Tarski and [[Steven Givant|Givant]] (1987).<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/article/abs/alfred-tarski-and-steven-givant-a-formalization-of-set-theory-without-variables-american-mathematical-society-colloquium-publications-vol-41-american-mathematical-society-providence1987-xxi-318-pp/9B436E22D3B3785570ABE9C85F870308 |title=Alfred Tarski and Steven Givant.

[[Solomon Feferman]] and [[Vann McGee]] further discussed Tarski's proposal{{which|date=July 2023}} in work published after his death. Feferman (1999) raises problems for the proposal and suggests a cure: replacing Tarski's preservation by automorphisms with preservation by arbitrary [[homomorphism]]s. In essence, this suggestion circumvents the difficulty Tarski's proposal has in dealing with a sameness of logical operation across distinct domains of a given cardinality and across domains of distinct cardinalities. Feferman's proposal results in a radical restriction of logical terms as compared to Tarski's original proposal. In particular, it ends up counting as logical only those operators of standard first-order logic without identity.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

[[Vann McGee]] (1996) provides a precise account of what operations are logical in the sense of Tarski's proposal in terms of expressibility in a language that extends first-order logic by allowing arbitrarily long conjunctions and disjunctions, and quantification over arbitrarily many variables. "Arbitrarily" includes a countable infinity.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1523019 |title=Revision |journal=Philosophical Issues |jstor=1523019 |access-date=28 April 2023 |last1=McGee |first1=Vann |year=1997 |volume=8 |pages=387–406 |doi=10.2307/1523019 }}</ref>
