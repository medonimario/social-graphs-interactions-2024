'''Oswald Arnold Gottfried Spengler'''{{efn|{{IPA|de|ˈɔsvalt ˈʃpɛŋlɐ|lang}}}} (29 May 1880 – 8 May 1936) was a German [[polymath]] whose areas of interest included [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], and [[art]], as well as their relation to his organic theory of history. He is best known for his two-volume work ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (''Der Untergang des Abendlandes''), published in 1918 and 1922, covering [[human history]]. Spengler's model of [[history]] postulates that human [[culture]]s and [[civilization]]s are akin to biological entities, each with a limited, predictable, and deterministic lifespan.

Spengler predicted that about the year 2000, [[Western culture|Western civilization]] would enter the period of pre‑death emergency which would lead to 200 years of [[Caesarism]] (extra-constitutional omnipotence of the [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch of government) before Western civilization's final collapse.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Holton |first=Gerald James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uFsn0czcji8C&pg=PA13 |title=Einstein, History, and Other Passions: The Rebellion Against Science at the End of the Twentieth Century |date=2000 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-00433-7 |language=en }}</ref>

Spengler is regarded as a [[German nationalist]] and a critic of [[republicanism]], and he was a prominent member of the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]]-era [[Conservative Revolution]]. The Nazis had viewed his writings as a means to provide a "respectable pedigree" to their ideology,<ref name="VQR"/> Spengler later criticized [[Nazism]] due to its excessive racialist elements. He saw [[Benito Mussolini]], and entrepreneurial types, like the mining magnate [[Cecil Rhodes]],<ref>The Decline of the West, Alfred A. Knopf. Volume 1, page 37, Atkinson's Translation.</ref> as examples of the impending Caesars of [[Western culture]]{{emdash}}later showcasing his disappointment in Mussolini's colonialist adventures.<ref>Letters of Oswald Spengler page 305, Alfred A. Knopf, 1966, Translation Arthur Helps. Here Spengler is quite critical of Mussolini's involvement in Abyssinia, saying: "Mussolini has lost the calm statesmanlike superiority of his first years...".</ref>

==Biography==

=== Early life and family ===
Oswald Arnold Gottfried Spengler was born on 29 May 1880 in [[Blankenburg (Harz)|Blankenburg]], [[Duchy of Brunswick]], [[German Empire]], the oldest surviving child of Bernhard Spengler (1844–1901) and Pauline Spengler (1840–1910), [[Birth name|née]] Grantzow, the descendant of an artistic family.{{Sfn|Naeher|1984|p=19}}{{Sfn|Engels|2019|p=4}} Oswald's elder brother was born prematurely in 1879, when his mother tried to move a heavy laundry basket, and died at the age of three weeks. Oswald was born ten months after his brother's death.<ref>Koktanek, Anton Mirko, Oswald Spengler in seiner Zeit, Beck, 1968, p. 10</ref> His younger sisters were Adele (1881–1917), Gertrud (1882–1957), and Hildegard (1885–1942).{{Sfn|Naeher|1984|p=19}} Oswald's paternal grandfather, Theodor Spengler&nbsp;(1806–1876), was a metallurgical inspector (''Hütteninspektor'') in [[Altenbrak]].<ref>Koktanek, Anton Mirko, Oswald Spengler in seiner Zeit. Beck, 1968, p. 3, 517</ref>

Spengler's maternal great-grandfather, Friedrich Wilhelm Grantzow, a tailor's apprentice in Berlin, had three children out of wedlock with a Jewish woman named Bräunchen Moses ({{circa}} 1769–1849) whom he later married, on 26 May 1799.<ref name="selfimage">{{cite book|last1=Awerbuch|first1=Marianne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALhtAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Br%C3%A4unchen+Moses%22|title=Bild und Selbstbild der Juden Berlins zwischen Aufklärung und Romantik|last2=Jersch-Wenzel|first2=Stefi|publisher=Colloquium|year=1992|isbn=9783767808058|place=Berlin|page=91|language=de|trans-title=Image and self-image of the Jews of Berlin between the Enlightenment and Romanticism}}</ref> Shortly before the wedding, Moses was baptized as Johanna Elisabeth Anspachin; the surname was chosen after her birthplace—[[Ansbach|Anspach]].<ref name="beck1968">Koktanek, Anton Mirko, Oswald Spengler in seiner Zeit. Beck, 1968, p. 5</ref> Her parents, Abraham and Reile Moses, were both deceased by then. The couple had another five children,<ref name="selfimage" /> one of whom was Spengler's maternal grandfather, Gustav Adolf Grantzow (1811–1883)—a solo dancer and ballet master in Berlin, who in 1837 married Katharina Kirchner (1813–1873), a solo dancer from a Munich Catholic family;<ref name="beck1968" /> the second of their four daughters was Oswald Spengler's mother Pauline Grantzow.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spengler|first=Oswald|title=Ich beneide jeden, der lebt|year=2007|place=Lilienfeld|page=126|isbn=9783940357021|language=de|trans-title=I envy anyone who lives}}</ref> Like the Grantzows in general, Pauline was of a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] disposition, and, before marrying Bernhard Spengler, accompanied her dancer sisters on tours. In appearance, she was plump. Her temperament, which Oswald inherited, was moody, irritable, and morose.<ref>Fischer, Klaus P., ''History and Prophecy: Oswald Spengler and The Decline of the West''. P. Lang, 1989, p. 27</ref>

=== Education ===
When Oswald was ten years of age, his family moved to the university city of [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]]. Here he received a classical education at the local [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (academically oriented secondary school), studying Greek, Latin, mathematics and sciences. Here, too, he developed his propensity for the arts—especially poetry, drama, and music—and came under the influence of the ideas of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].{{Sfn|Hughes|1991|p=59}} At 17, he wrote a drama titled ''Montezuma''.{{Sfn|Engels|2019|p=4}}

After his father's death in 1901, Spengler attended several universities ([[University of Munich|Munich]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Halle|Halle]]) as a private scholar, taking courses in a wide range of subjects. His studies were undirected. In 1903, he failed his [[doctoral thesis]] on [[Heraclitus]]—titled ''Der metaphysische Grundgedanke der heraklitischen Philosophie'' (''The Fundamental Metaphysical Thought of the Heraclitean Philosophy'') and conducted under the direction of [[Alois Riehl]]—because of insufficient references. He took the [[thesis defense|doctoral oral exam]] again and received his [[PhD]] from Halle on 6 April 1904. In December 1904, he began to write the secondary dissertation (''[[Staatsexamen]]sarbeit'') necessary to qualify as a high school teacher. This became ''The Development of the Organ of Sight in the Higher Realms of the Animal Kingdom'' (''Die Entwicklung des Sehorgans bei den Hauptstufen des Tierreiches''), a text now lost.<ref>Mark Sedgwick (ed.), ''Key Thinkers of the Radical Right: Behind the New Threat to Liberal Democracy'', Oxford University Press, 2019, p. 17.</ref> It was approved and he received his teaching certificate. In 1905, Spengler suffered a [[nervous breakdown]].

=== Career ===
Spengler briefly served as a teacher in [[Saarbrücken]] then in [[Düsseldorf]]. From 1908 to 1911 he worked at a grammar school (''Realgymnasium'') in [[Hamburg]], where he taught science, German history, and mathematics. Biographers report that his life as a teacher was uneventful.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Oswald Spengler - an intellectual life |url=https://engelsbergideas.com/portraits/oswald-spengler-an-intellectual-life/ |access-date=2024-11-09 |website=Engelsberg ideas |language=en}}</ref>

In 1911, following his mother's death, he moved to [[Munich]], where he lived for the rest of his life. While there, he was a cloistered scholar, supported by his modest inheritance. Spengler survived on very limited means and was marked by loneliness. He owned no books, and took work as a tutor and wrote for magazines to earn additional income. Due to a severe heart problem, Spengler was exempted from military service.{{Sfn|Engels|2019|p=4}} During the war, his inheritance was useless because it was invested overseas; thus, he lived in genuine poverty for this period.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

He began work on the first volume of ''The Decline of the West'' intending to focus on Germany within Europe. However, the [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911 affected him deeply, so he widened the scope of his study. According to Spengler the book was completed in 1914, but the first edition was published in the summer of 1918, shortly before the end of [[World War I]].{{Sfn|Engels|2019|p=5}} Spengler wrote about the years immediately prior to World War I in ''Decline'':

{{Blockquote|At that time the World-War appeared to me both as imminent and also as the inevitable outward manifestation of the historical crisis, and my endeavor was to comprehend it from an examination of the spirit of the preceding centuries—not years. ... Thereafter I saw the present—the approaching World-War—in a quite other light. It was no longer a momentary constellation of casual facts due to national sentiments, personal influences, or economic tendencies endowed with an appearance of unity and necessity by some historian's scheme of political or social cause-and-effect, but the type of ''historical change of phase'' occurring within a great historical organism of definable compass at the point preordained for it hundreds of years ago.<ref>Spengler, Oswald. [https://archive.org/stream/Decline-Of-The-West-Oswald-Spengler/Decline_Of_The_West#page/n62/mode/1up ''The Decline of the West'']. V. 1, Alfred A. Knopf, 1926, pp. 46–47.</ref>}}

When the first volume of ''The Decline of the West'' was published, it was a wild success.{{Efn|The original Preface is dated December 1917 and ends with Spengler expressing hope that "his book would not be unworthy of German military achievements".}} Spengler became an instant celebrity.{{Sfn|Engels|2019|p=5}} The national humiliation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919), followed by [[economic depression]] in 1923 and [[hyperinflation]], seemed to prove Spengler right. ''Decline'' comforted Germans because it could be used as a rationale for their diminished pre-eminence, i.e. due to larger world-historical processes. The book met with wide success outside of Germany as well, and by 1919 had been translated into several other languages.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

The second volume of ''Decline'' was published in 1922. In it, Spengler argued that German [[socialism]] differed from [[Marxism]]; instead, he said it was more compatible with traditional German conservatism. Spengler declined an appointment as Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Göttingen]], saying he needed time to focus on writing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

The book was widely discussed, even by those who had not read it. Historians took umbrage at his unapologetically non-scientific approach. Novelist [[Thomas Mann]] compared reading Spengler's book to reading [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s works for the first time. Academics gave it a mixed reception. Sociologist [[Max Weber]] described Spengler as a "very ingenious and learned dilettante", while philosopher [[Karl Popper]] called the thesis "pointless". Both volumes of ''Decline'' were published in English by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in 1926.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

===Aftermath===
In 1924, following the social-economic upheaval and [[hyperinflation]], Spengler entered politics in an effort to bring [[Reichswehr]] General [[Hans von Seeckt]] to power as the country's [[leadership|leader]]. The attempt failed and Spengler proved ineffective in practical politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

A 1928 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' review of the second volume of ''Decline'' described the immense influence and controversy Spengler's ideas enjoyed during the 1920s: "When the first volume of ''The Decline of the West'' appeared in Germany a few years ago, thousands of copies were sold. Cultivated European discourse quickly became Spengler-saturated. Spenglerism spurted from the pens of countless disciples. It was imperative to read Spengler, to sympathize or revolt. It still remains so".<ref>{{cite magazine|date=10 December 1928|title=Patterns in Chaos|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928375,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122151616/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928375,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 November 2007|access-date=9 August 2008}}</ref>

In 1931, he published ''[[Man and Technics]]'', which warned against the dangers of [[technology]] and [[industrialism]] to culture. He especially pointed to the tendency of Western technology to spread to hostile "Colored races" which would then use the weapons against the West.{{Sfn|Hughes|1991|p=}} It was poorly received because of its anti-industrialism.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} This book contains the well-known Spengler quote "Optimism is cowardice".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spengler |first1=Oswald |last2=Atkinson |first2=Charles Francis |title=Man and technics; a contribution to a philosophy of life; translated from the German by Charles Francis Atkinson |date=1932 |publisher=A.A. Knopf}}</ref>

Despite voting for [[Hitler]] over [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] in 1932, Spengler found the Führer vulgar. He met Hitler in 1933 and after a lengthy discussion remained unimpressed, saying that Germany did not need a "heroic tenor" <nowiki>[</nowiki>: one of several conventional tenor classifications] but a real [[hero]] ". He quarreled publicly with [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and his pessimism and remarks about the Führer resulted in isolation and public silence. He further rejected offers from [[Joseph Goebbels]] to give public speeches. However, Spengler did become a member of the German Academy that year.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

''The Hour of Decision'', published in 1934, was a bestseller, but was later banned for its critique of [[National Socialism]]. Spengler's criticisms of [[liberalism]]<ref>Tate, Allen (1934). "Spengler's Tract Against Liberalism," ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'' April 1934.</ref> were welcomed by the Nazis, but Spengler disagreed with their biological ideology and [[anti-Semitism]].{{Sfn|Farrenkopf|2001|pp=237–38}}  While racial mysticism played a key role in his own worldview, Spengler had always been an outspoken critic of the racial theories professed by the Nazis and many others in his time, and was not inclined to change his views during and after Hitler's rise to power.{{Sfn|Engels|2019|p=6}}  Although a German nationalist, Spengler viewed the Nazis as too narrowly German, and not [[Western world|occidental]] enough to lead the fight against other peoples. The book also warned of a coming world war in which Western Civilization risked being destroyed, and was widely distributed abroad before eventually being banned by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] in Germany.  A ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' review of ''The Hour of Decision'' noted Spengler's international popularity as a polemicist, observing that "When Oswald Spengler speaks, many a Western Worldling stops to listen". The review recommended the book for "readers who enjoy vigorous writing", who "will be glad to be rubbed the wrong way by Spengler's harsh aphorisms" and his pessimistic predictions.<ref>{{cite news|date=12 February 1934|title=Spengler Speaks|work=Time Magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746957,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517053047/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746957,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 May 2008|access-date=9 August 2008}}</ref>

=== Later life and death ===
[[File:Grab Oswald Spengler.jpg|thumb|alt=Oswald Spengler's grave on a snowy day.|Spengler's grave]]
On 13 October 1933, Spengler became one of the hundred senators of the [[Deutsche Akademie|German Academy]].<ref>''Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift der Karl-Marx-Universität Leipzig''. V. 17, 1968, p. 71</ref><ref>[https://www.google.co.uk/search?newwindow=1&hl=en&tbm=bks&q=%22Dr.+Oswald+Spengler%2C+München%2C+Senator+der+Deutschen+Akademie%22 ''Mitteilungen''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230405180100/https://www.google.co.uk/search?newwindow=1&hl=en&tbm=bks&q=%22Dr.+Oswald+Spengler,+M%C3%BCnchen,+Senator+der+Deutschen+Akademie%22 |date=5 April 2023 }}. Deutsche Akademie, 1936, p. 571. "Dr. Oswald Spengler, München, Senator der Deutschen Akademie"</ref>

Spengler spent his final years in Munich, listening to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], reading [[Molière]] and [[Shakespeare]], buying several thousand books, and collecting ancient [[Classical Anatolia|Turkish]], [[History of Iran#Median and Achaemenid Empire (680–330 BC)|Persian]] and [[History of India#Classical period (c. 200 BCE – c. 650 CE)|Indian]] weapons. He made occasional trips to the [[Harz mountains]] and to Italy.

Spengler died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 8 May 1936, in Munich, at age 55.{{Sfn|Hughes|1991|p=136}} He was buried in the [[Nordfriedhof (Munich)|Nordfriedhof]] in [[Munich]].

==Views==

=== Influences ===
In the introduction to ''The Decline of the West'', Spengler cites [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann W. von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] as his major influences. Goethe's vitalism and Nietzsche's cultural criticism, in particular, are highlighted in his works.{{Sfn|Engels|2019|p=7}}

{{blockquote|I feel urged to name once more those to whom I owe practically everything: Goethe and Nietzsche. Goethe gave me method, Nietzsche the questioning faculty…<ref>Spengler, Oswald. [https://archive.org/stream/Decline-Of-The-West-Oswald-Spengler/Decline_Of_The_West#page/n12/mode/1up ''The Decline of the West'']. V. 1, Alfred A. Knopf, 1926, p. xiv.</ref>}} Spengler was also influenced by the universal and cyclical vision of [[World history (field)|world history]] proposed by the German historian [[Eduard Meyer]].{{Sfn|Engels|2019|p=7}} The belief in the progression of civilizations through an evolutionary process comparable with living beings can be traced back to classical antiquity, although it is difficult to assess the extent of the influence those thinkers had on Spengler: [[Cato the Elder]], [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Florus]], [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], and later, [[Francis Bacon]], who compared different empires with each other with the help of biological analogies.{{Sfn|Engels|2019|pp=7–8}}

===''The Decline of the West'' (1918)===
{{main|The Decline of the West}}
The concept of historical philosophy developed by Spengler is founded upon two assumptions: 
* the existence of social entities called 'Cultures' (''Kulturen'') and regarded as the largest possible actors in human history, which itself had no metaphysical sense, 
* the parallelism between the evolution of those Cultures and the evolution of living beings.

Spengler enumerates nine Cultures: [[Ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Babylonia]]n, Indian, Chinese, [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] or 'Apollonian', 'Magian' or 'Arabic' (including early and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Christianity]] and Islam), Mexican, [[Western world|Western]] or 'Faustian', and Russian. They interacted with each other in time and space but were distinctive due to 'internal' attributes. According to Spengler, "Cultures are organisms, and world-history is their collective biography."{{Sfn|Engels|2019|pp= 8–9}}

{{Blockquote|'Mankind'… has no aim, no idea, no plan, any more than the family of butterflies or orchids. 'Mankind' is a zoological expression, or an empty word. … I see, in place of that empty figment of one linear history which can only be kept up by shutting one’s eyes to the overwhelming multitude of the facts, the drama of a number of mighty Cultures, each springing with primitive strength from the soil of a mother region to which it remains firmly bound throughout its whole life-cycle; each stamping its material, its mankind, in its own image; each having its own idea, its own passions, its own life, will and feeling, its own death.<ref>Spengler, Oswald. [https://archive.org/stream/Decline-Of-The-West-Oswald-Spengler/Decline_Of_The_West#page/n12/mode/1up ''The Decline of the West'']. V. 1, Alfred A. Knopf, 1926, p. 21.</ref>}}

Spengler also compares the evolution of Cultures to the different ages of human life, "Every Culture passes through the age-phases of the individual man. Each has its childhood, youth, manhood and old age." When a Culture enters its late stage, Spengler argues, it becomes a 'Civilization' (''Zivilisation''), a petrified body characterized in the modern age by technology, imperialism, and mass society, which he expected to fossilize and decline from the 2000s onward.{{Sfn|Engels|2019|p=10}} The first-millennium [[Near East]] was, in his view, not a transition between [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]], [[Western Christianity]], and [[Islam]], but rather an emerging new Culture he named 'Arabian' or 'Magian', explaining messianic Judaism, [[Christianity in the 1st century|early Christianity]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and Islam as different expressions of a single Culture sharing a unique worldview.{{Sfn|Engels|2019|pp=11–12}}

The great historian of antiquity [[Eduard Meyer]] thought highly of Spengler, although he also had some criticisms of him. Spengler's obscurity, intuitiveness, and mysticism were easy targets, especially for the [[positivism|positivists]] and [[neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantians]] who rejected the possibility that there was meaning in world history. The critic and aesthete Count [[Harry Graf Kessler|Harry Kessler]] thought him unoriginal and rather inane, especially in regard to his opinion on [[Nietzsche]]. Philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], however, shared Spengler's cultural pessimism. Spengler's work became an important foundation for [[social cycle theory]].<ref name="wittgen">{{cite journal |last1=Losev |first1=Alexander |title=Morphological Investigations: Wittgenstein and Spengler |journal=Philosophia: e-Journal of Philosophy and Culture|date=2012 |volume=4 |pages=79–82 |url=https://philarchive.org/archive/LOSMIW |access-date=13 October 2022 |publisher=Sophia University |location=Sophia, Bulgaria |issn=1314-5606}}</ref>

==== Nazism and Fascism ====
Spengler was an important influence on Nazi ideology. He "provided skeletal Nazi ideas" to the early Nazi movement "and gave them a respectable pedigree".<ref name="VQR">{{cite web |last1=Dreher |first1=Carl |title=Spengler and the Third Reich |url=https://www.vqronline.org/essay/spengler-and-third-reich |website=VQR |access-date=7 February 2023 |archive-date=7 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230207131601/https://www.vqronline.org/essay/spengler-and-third-reich |url-status=live }}</ref> Key parts of his writings were incorporated into Nazi Party ideology.<ref name="VQR"/>

Spengler's criticism of the Nazi Party was taken seriously by Hitler, and Carl Deher credited him for inspiring Hitler to carry out the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in which [[Ernst Röhm]] and other leaders of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) were executed.<ref name="VQR"/> In 1934, Spengler pronounced the funeral oration for one of the victims of the Night of the Long Knives and retired in 1935 from the board of the highly influential [[Nietzsche Archive]] which was viewed as opposition to the regime.{{Sfn|Engels|2019|p=6}}

Spengler considered [[Judaism]] to be a "disintegrating element" (zersetzendes Element) that acts destructively "wherever it intervenes" (wo es auch eingreift). In his view, Jews are characterized by a "cynical intelligence" (zynische Intelligenz) and their "money thinking" (Gelddenken).<ref>Ulrich Wyrwa:&nbsp;Spengler, Oswald.&nbsp;In:&nbsp;Wolfgang Benz&nbsp;(Hrsg.):&nbsp;Handbuch des Antisemitismus. Bd. 2: Personen. De Gruyter Saur, Berlin 2009,&nbsp;{{ISBN|978-3-598-44159-2}}</ref> Therefore, they were incapable of adapting to Western culture and represented a foreign body in Europe. He also clarifies in ''The Decline of the West'' that this is a pattern shared in all civilizations: He mentions how the ancient Jew would have seen the cynical, atheistic Romans of the late Roman empire the same way Westerners today see Jews. Alexander Bein argues that with these characterizations Spengler contributed significantly to the enforcement of Jewish stereotypes in pre-WW2 German circles.<ref>Alexander Bein:&nbsp;[https://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/1965_2_1_bein.pdf „Der jüdische Parasit“] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210309180908/https://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/1965_2_1_bein.pdf |date=9 March 2021 }}.&nbsp;In:&nbsp;''Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte'', 13 (1965), Heft 2, p. 150.</ref>

Spengler viewed Nazi anti-Semitism as self-defeating, and personally took an [[Ethnology|ethnological]] view of race and culture.<ref name="VQR"/> In his private papers, he remarked upon "how much envy of the capability of other people in view of one's lack of it lies hidden in anti-Semitism!", and arguing that "when one would rather destroy business and scholarship than see Jews in them, one is an ideologue, i.e., a danger for the nation. Idiotic."{{Sfn|Farrenkopf|2001|pp=237–38}}

Spengler, however, regarded the transformation of ultra-capitalist mass democracies into dictatorial regimes as inevitable, and he had expressed acknowledgement for [[Benito Mussolini]] and the [[National Fascist Party|Italian Fascist]] movement as a first symptom of this development.{{Sfn|Engels|2019|p=6}}
