In addition, he wrote many works on various aspects of [[physics]]: [[statistical mechanics]] and [[thermodynamics]], physics of [[dielectric]]s, [[colour theory]], [[electrodynamics]], [[general relativity]], and [[cosmology]], and he made several attempts to construct a [[unified field theory]]. In his book ''[[What Is Life?]]'' Schrödinger addressed the problems of [[genetics]], looking at the phenomenon of life from the point of view of physics.

Spending most of his life as an academic with positions at various universities, Schrödinger, along with [[Paul Dirac]], won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1933 for his work on quantum mechanics, the same year he left Germany due to his opposition to [[Nazism]]. In his personal life, he lived with both his wife and his mistress which may have led to problems causing him to leave his position at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. Subsequently, until 1938, he had a position in [[University of Graz|Graz]], Austria, until the [[Anschluss|Nazi takeover]] when he fled, finally finding a long-term arrangement in [[Dublin]], Ireland, where he remained until retirement in 1955, and where he pursued several sexual relationships with minors.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Schrödinger was born in {{interlanguage link|Erdberg, Vienna|lt=Erdberg|de|Erdberg (Wien)}}, [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], on 12 August 1887, to [[Rudolf Schrödinger]] ({{linktext |cerecloth}} producer, botanist<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schrodinger |first1=Rudolf |title=The International Plant Names Index |url=https://www.ipni.org/?q=author%20std%3ASchr%C3%B6dinger |publisher=IPNI |access-date=13 August 2016 |archive-date=13 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813223013/https://www.ipni.org/?q=author%20std:Schr%C3%B6dinger |url-status=live }}</ref>)<ref name="The Nobel Prize in Physics 1933">{{Cite book |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1933/schrodinger/biographical/ |title=Physics 1922-1941 |publisher=Elsevier Publishing Company |year=1965 |series=Nobel Lectures |location=Amsterdam |at=Erwin Schrödinger Biographical |language=en-US |via=nobelprize.org |access-date=19 February 2023 |archive-date=7 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307163835/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1933/schrodinger/biographical/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and Georgine Emilia Brenda Schrödinger (née Bauer) (daughter of {{interlanguage link |Alexander Bauer |de|3=Alexander Bauer (Chemiker)}}, professor of chemistry, [[TU Wien]]).{{sfn|Moore|1994|pp=13–18}} He was their only child.

His mother was of half Austrian and half English descent; his father was [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and his mother was [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. He himself was an [[atheist]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1994|pages=289–290}} Quote: "In one respect, however, he is not a romantic: he does not idealize the person of the beloved, his highest praise is to consider her his equal. 'When you feel your own equal in the body of a beautiful woman, just as ready to forget the world for you as you for her – oh my good Lord – who can describe what happiness then. You can live it, now and again – you cannot speak of it.' Of course, he does speak of it, and almost always with religious imagery. Yet at this time he also wrote, 'By the way, I never realized that to be nonbelieving, to be an atheist, was a thing to be proud of. It went without saying as it were.' And in another place at about this same time: 'Our creed is indeed a queer creed. You others, Christians (and similar people), consider our ethics much inferior, indeed abominable. There is that little difference. We adhere to ours in practice, you don't.'"</ref> However, he had strong interests in [[Eastern religions]] and [[pantheism]], and he used religious symbolism in his works.<ref>{{cite book|title=Einstein's Dice and Schrödinger's Cat|year=2015|publisher=Perseus Books Group|isbn=978-0-465-07571-3|author=Paul Halpern|page=157|quote="In the presentation of a scientific problem, the other player is the good Lord. He has not only set the problem but also has devised the rules of the game--but they are not completely known, half of them are left for you to discover or deduce. I am very astonished that the scientific picture of the real world around me is very deficient. It gives a lot of factual information, puts all our experience in a magnificently consistent order, but is ghastly silent about all that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us. It cannot tell us a word about red and blue, bitter and sweet, physical pain and physical delight; it knows nothing of beautiful and ugly, good or bad, God and eternity. Science sometimes pretends to answer questions in these domains, but the answers are very often so silly that we are not inclined to take them seriously. I shall quite briefly mention here the notorious atheism of science. The theists reproach it for this again and again. Unjustly. A personal God cannot be encountered in a world picture that becomes accessible only at the price that everything personal is excluded from it. We know that whenever God is experienced, it is an experience exactly as real as a direct sense impression, as real as one's own personality. As such He must be missing from the space-time picture. "I do not meet with God in space and time", so says the honest scientific thinker, and for that reason he is reproached by those in whose catechism it is nevertheless stated: "God is a Spirit." Whence came I and whither go I? That is the great unfathomable question, the same for every one of us. Science has no answer for it"}}</ref> He also believed his scientific work was an approach to divinity in an intellectual sense.<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1992|p=4}} Quote: "He rejected traditional religious beliefs (Jewish, Christian, and Islamic) not on the basis of any reasoned argument, nor even with an expression of emotional antipathy, for he loved to use religious expressions and metaphors, but simply by saying that they are naive." ... "He claimed to be an atheist, but he always used religious symbolism and believed his scientific work was an approach to the godhead."</ref>

He was also able to learn English outside school, as his maternal grandmother was British.<ref name="hof1">{{cite book|author=Hoffman, D.|title=Эрвин Шрёдингер|publisher=Мир |year=1987 |pages=13–17}}</ref> Between 1906 and 1910 (the year he earned his doctorate) Schrödinger studied at the [[University of Vienna]] under the physicists [[Franz S. Exner]] (1849–1926) and [[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] (1874–1915). He received his doctorate at Vienna under Hasenöhrl. He also conducted experimental work with Karl Wilhelm Friedrich "Fritz" Kohlrausch. In 1911, Schrödinger became an assistant to Exner.<ref name="The Nobel Prize in Physics 1933" />

===Middle years===
[[File:Erwin Schrodinger2.jpg|thumb|upright|Erwin Schrödinger as a young man]]
In 1914 Schrödinger achieved [[habilitation]] (''venia legendi''). Between 1914 and 1918 he participated in war work as a commissioned officer in the Austrian fortress artillery ([[Gorizia]], [[Duino]], [[Sistiana]], Prosecco, Vienna). In 1920 he became the assistant to [[Max Wien]], in [[Jena]], and in September 1920 he attained the position of ao. Prof. (''[[ausserordentlicher Professor]]''), roughly equivalent to Reader (UK) or associate professor (US), in [[Stuttgart]]. In 1921, he became o. Prof. (''[[ordentlicher Professor]]'', i.e. full professor), in [[Breslau University|Breslau]] (now Wrocław, Poland).<ref name="The Nobel Prize in Physics 1933"/>

In 1921, he moved to the [[University of Zurich|University of Zürich]]. In 1927, he succeeded [[Max Planck]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin. In 1933, Schrödinger decided to leave Germany because he strongly disapproved of the Nazis' antisemitism. He became a Fellow of [[Magdalen College]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. Soon after he arrived, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics together with [[Paul Dirac]]. His position at Oxford did not work out well; his unconventional domestic arrangements, sharing living quarters with two women,{{sfn|Moore|1992|pp=278 ff.}} were not met with acceptance. In 1934, Schrödinger lectured at [[Princeton University]]; he was offered a permanent position there, but did not accept it. Again, his wish to set up house with his wife and his mistress may have created a problem.<ref>[https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz106819.html "Schrödinger, Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427042804/https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz106819.html |date=27 April 2011 }} in ''Deutsche Biographie''</ref> He had the prospect of a position at the [[University of Edinburgh]] but visa delays occurred, and in the end he took up a position at the [[University of Graz]] in Austria in 1936. He had also accepted the offer of chair position at Department of Physics, [[Allahabad University]] in India.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jta.org/1940/05/20/archive/bombay-university-names-refugee-scientist-to-faculty |title=Bombay University Names Refugee Scientist to Faculty |publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=20 May 1940 |access-date=14 August 2016 |archive-date=27 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027074754/http://www.jta.org/1940/05/20/archive/bombay-university-names-refugee-scientist-to-faculty |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the midst of these tenure issues in 1935, after extensive correspondence with [[Albert Einstein]], he proposed what is now called the "[[Schrödinger's cat]]" [[thought experiment]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bhaumik |first1=Mani L. |title=Is Schrödinger's Cat Alive? |journal=Quanta |date=2017 |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=75 |doi=10.12743/quanta.v6i1.68 |doi-access=free|arxiv=2211.17086 }}</ref>

===Later years===
In 1938, after the [[Anschluss]], Schrödinger had problems in Graz because of his flight from Germany in 1933 and his known opposition to [[Nazism]].<ref name="Lakhtakia1996">{{cite book|author=Akhlesh Lakhtakia|title=Models and Modelers of Hydrogen: Thales, Thomson, Rutherford, Bohr, Sommerfeld, Goudsmit, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Dirac, Sallhofer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6lC6IG7NXmcC&pg=PA147|year=1996|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-2302-1|pages=147–}}</ref> He issued a statement recanting this opposition.<ref name="mactutorB" /> He later regretted doing so and explained the reason to Einstein: "I wanted to remain free – and could not do so without great duplicity".<ref name=mactutorB>{{cite web |title=Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger |url=https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Schrodinger/ |publisher=[[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]] |access-date=14 August 2016 |archive-date=4 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104063158/http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Printonly/Schrodinger.html |url-status=live }}</ref> However, this did not fully appease the new dispensation and the University of Graz dismissed him from his post for political unreliability. He suffered harassment and was instructed not to leave the country. He and his wife, however, fled to Italy. From there, he went to visiting positions in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[Ghent University]].<ref name="mactutorB" /><ref name="Lakhtakia1996"/>

In the same year he received a personal invitation from Ireland's [[Taoiseach]], [[Éamon de Valera]] – a mathematician himself – to reside in Ireland and agreed to help establish an [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|Institute for Advanced Studies]] in Dublin.<ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Daugherty |title=Brief Chronology |work=Erwin Schrödinger |url=http://bdaugherty.tripod.com/berlin/schrodinger.html |access-date=10 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309141433/http://bdaugherty.tripod.com/berlin/schrodinger.html |archive-date=9 March 2012}}</ref> He moved to Kincora Road, [[Clontarf, Dublin]], and lived modestly.

In October 1940, a writer from the ''[[Irish Press]]'' interviewed Schrödinger who spoke of Celtic heritage of Austrians, saying: "I believe there is a deeper connection between us Austrians and the Celts. Names of places in the Austrian Alps are said to be of Celtic origin."{{sfn|Moore|1992|p=373}} He became the Director of the School for Theoretical Physics in 1940 and remained there for 17 years. He became a naturalized Irish citizen in 1948, but also retained his Austrian citizenship.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Clary |first=David C. |title=Foreign Membership of the Royal Society: Schrödinger and Heisenberg? |journal=Notes and Records: The Royal Society Journal of the History of Science |year=2022 |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=513–536 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2021.0082|s2cid=247599443 |doi-access=free }}</ref> He wrote around 50 further publications on various topics, including his explorations of [[classical unified field theories|unified field theory]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Erwin Schrödinger - Important Scientists – The Physics of the Universe |url=https://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/scientists_schrodinger.html |access-date=2023-02-19 |website=www.physicsoftheuniverse.com |archive-date=19 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230219112213/https://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/scientists_schrodinger.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1944, he wrote ''[[What Is Life?]]'', which contains a discussion of [[negentropy]] and the concept of a complex [[molecule]] with the genetic code for living [[organism]]s. According to [[James D. Watson]]'s memoir, ''DNA, the Secret of Life'', Schrödinger's book gave Watson the inspiration to research the [[gene]], which led to the discovery of the [[DNA]] [[double helix]] structure in 1953. Similarly, [[Francis Crick]], in his autobiographical book ''What Mad Pursuit'', described how he was influenced by Schrödinger's speculations about how genetic information might be stored in molecules.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crick |first=Francis |title=What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery |publisher=Basic Books |year=1988 |isbn=0-465-09137-7 |location=New York}}</ref>

Schrödinger stayed in Dublin until retiring in 1955.

In 1956, he returned to Vienna (chair ''ad personam''). At an important lecture during the World Energy Conference he refused to speak on nuclear energy because of his scepticism about it and gave a philosophical lecture instead. During this period, Schrödinger turned from mainstream quantum mechanics' definition of [[wave–particle duality]] and promoted the [[wave–particle duality#Wave-only view|wave idea alone]], causing much controversy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/biographies/bio_schrodinger-erwin.html|title=Nuclear Files: Library: Biographies: Erwin Schrödinger|access-date=14 September 2021|archive-date=19 February 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230219131850/http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/biographies/bio_schrodinger-erwin.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Schrödinger, Are There Quantum Jumps, 1952. http://www.ub.edu/hcub/hfq/sites/default/files/Quantum_Jumps_I.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210411004001/http://www.ub.edu/hcub/hfq/sites/default/files/Quantum_Jumps_I.pdf |date=11 April 2021 }}</ref>

===Tuberculosis and death===

Schrödinger suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and several times in the 1920s stayed at a [[sanatorium]] in [[Arosa]] in Switzerland. It was there that he formulated his wave equation.{{sfn|Moore|1992|p=194}} On 4 January 1961, Schrödinger died of tuberculosis, aged 73, in [[Vienna]].{{sfn|Moore|1992|p=10}} He left Anny a widow, and was buried in [[Alpbach]], Austria, in a Catholic cemetery. Although he was not Catholic, the priest in charge of the cemetery permitted the burial after learning Schrödinger was a member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1992|p=482}}: "There was some problem about burial in the churchyard since Erwin was not a Catholic, but the priest relented when informed that he was a member in good standing of the Papal Academy, and a plot was made available at the edge of the Friedhof."</ref>

==Personal life==
On April 6, 1920, Schrödinger married Annemarie (Anny) Bertel.{{sfn|Moore|1992|p=10}}<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1992}} discusses Schrödinger's unconventional relationships, including his affair with Hildegunde March, in chapters seven and eight, "Berlin" and "Exile in Oxford".</ref>

When he migrated to Ireland in 1938, he obtained visas for himself, his wife and also another woman, Hilde March. March was the wife of an Austrian colleague and Schrödinger had fathered a daughter with her in 1934.<ref name="ReferenceA">Ronan Fanning, ''Éamon de Valera: A Will to Power'', Faber & Faber, 2015</ref> Schrödinger wrote to the [[Taoiseach]], [[Éamon de Valera]] personally, so as to obtain a visa for March.

=== Sexual abuse allegations ===
At the age of 39, Schrödinger tutored a 14-year-old girl named "Ithi" Junger. Walter Moore relates in his 1989 biography of Schrödinger that the lessons "included 'a fair amount of petting and cuddling{{'"}} and Schrödinger "had fallen in love with his pupil".<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1989}}</ref> Moore further relates that "not long after her seventeenth birthday, they became lovers". The relationship continued and in 1932 she became pregnant (then aged 20<ref>{{Cite web |last=Taschwer |first=Klaus |date=2022-10-20 |title=Schrödingers verlorene Ehre – und ein Versuch ihrer Wiederherstellung |url=https://www.derstandard.de/story/2000140122217/schroedingers-verlorene-ehre-und-ein-versuch-ihrer-wiederherstellung |access-date=2024-03-23 |website=Der Standard |language=de-AT}}</ref>). "Erwin tried to persuade her to have the child; he said he would take care of it, but he did not offer to divorce [wife] Anny... in desperation, Ithi arranged for an abortion."

Moore describes Schrödinger having a 'Lolita complex'. He quotes from Schrödinger's diary from the time where he said that "men of strong, genuine intellectuality are immensely attracted only by women who, forming the very beginning of the intellectual series, are as nearly connected to the preferred springs of nature as they". A 2021 [[The Irish Times|''Irish Times'']] article summarized this as a "predilection for teenage girls", and denounced Schrödinger as "a serial abuser whose behaviour fitted the profile of a paedophile in the widely understood sense of that term".<ref name="Humphreys">{{Cite news |last=Humphreys |first=Joe |title=How Erwin Schrödinger indulged his 'Lolita complex' in Ireland |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/how-erwin-schr%C3%B6dinger-indulged-his-lolita-complex-in-ireland-1.4749204 |url-access=subscription|date=2021-12-11 |access-date=2022-01-25 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20230227041053/https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/how-erwin-schr%C3%B6dinger-indulged-his-lolita-complex-in-ireland-1.4749204|archive-date=2023-02-27|url-status=live|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|language=en}}</ref> Schrödinger's grandson and his mother were unhappy with the accusation made by Moore, and once the biography was published, their family broke off contact with him.<ref name="derstandard" />

[[Carlo Rovelli]] notes in his book ''[[Helgoland (book)|Helgoland]]'' that Schrödinger "always kept a number of relationships going at once – and made no secret of his fascination with preadolescent girls".

Walter Moore stated that Schrödinger's attitude towards women was "that of a male supremacist",{{sfn|Moore|1989|loc=chapter 8}} but that he disliked the "official misogyny" at Oxford which socially excluded women. [[Helge Kragh]], in his review of Moore's biography, said the "conquest of women, especially very young women, was the salt of life for this sincere romantic and male chauvinist".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kragh |first=Helge |date=1990 |title=Review of Schrödinger.

==Academic interests and life of the mind==

Early in his life, Schrödinger experimented in the fields of [[electrical engineering]], [[atmospheric electricity]], and atmospheric [[radioactivity]], but he usually worked with his former teacher Franz Exner. He also studied [[molecular vibration|vibrational]] theory, the theory of [[Brownian motion]], and [[mathematical statistics]]. In 1912, at the request of the editors of the ''Handbook of Electricity and Magnetism'', Schrödinger wrote an article titled ''Dielectrism''. That same year, Schrödinger gave a theoretical estimate of the probable height distribution of radioactive substances, which is required to explain the observed radioactivity of the atmosphere, and in August 1913 executed several experiments in Zeehame that confirmed his theoretical estimate and those of Victor Franz Hess. For this work, Schrödinger was awarded the 1920 [[Haitinger Prize]] (Haitinger-Preis) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.<ref name="Mehra">{{cite book|last1=Mehra |first1=J. |author-link1=Jagdish Mehra |last2=Rechenberg |first2=H. |author-link2=Helmut Rechenberg |year=1987 |title=Erwin Schrödinger and the Rise of Wave Mechanics |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-95179-9 |oclc=692702783}}</ref> Other experimental studies conducted by the young researcher in 1914 were checking formulas for capillary pressure in gas bubbles and the study of the properties of soft [[beta radiation]] produced by [[gamma rays]] striking a metal surface. The last work he performed together with his friend Fritz Kohlrausch. In 1919, Schrödinger performed his last physical experiment on [[coherent light]] and subsequently focused on theoretical studies.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

===Quantum mechanics===

====New quantum theory====
In the first years of his career, Schrödinger became acquainted with the ideas of the [[old quantum theory]], developed in the works of Einstein, [[Max Planck]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], and others. This knowledge helped him work on some problems in [[theoretical physics]], but the Austrian scientist at the time was not yet ready to part with the traditional methods of [[classical physics]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fischer |first=Earnst Peter |date=Autumn 1984 |title=We Are All Aspects of One Single Being: An Introduction to Erwin Schrödinger |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40970963 |journal=Social Research |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=809–835 |jstor=40970963 |pmid=11616408 |via=JSTORE |jstor-access= |access-date=6 February 2024 |archive-date=6 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240206162904/https://www.jstor.org/stable/40970963 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Schrödinger's first publications about atomic theory and the theory of spectra began to emerge only from the beginning of the 1920s, after his personal acquaintance with Sommerfeld and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and his move to Germany. In January 1921, Schrödinger finished his first article on this subject, about the framework of the [[Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization|Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization]] of the interaction of electrons on some features of the spectra of the alkali metals. Of particular interest to him was the introduction of relativistic considerations in quantum theory. In autumn 1922, he analyzed the electron orbits in an atom from a geometric point of view, using methods developed by his friend [[Hermann Weyl]]. This work, in which it was shown that quantum orbits are associated with certain geometric properties, was an important step in predicting some of the features of wave mechanics. Earlier in the same year, he created the Schrödinger equation of the [[relativistic Doppler effect]] for spectral lines, based on the hypothesis of light quanta and considerations of energy and momentum. He liked the idea of his teacher Exner on the statistical nature of the conservation laws, so he enthusiastically embraced the [[BKS theory]] of Bohr, [[Hans Kramers]], and [[John C. Slater]], which suggested the possibility of violation of these laws in individual atomic processes (for example, in the process of emission of radiation). Although the [[Bothe–Geiger coincidence experiment]] soon cast doubt on this, the idea of energy as a statistical concept was a lifelong attraction for Schrödinger, and he discussed it in some reports and publications.<ref name=jammer>{{cite book|first=Max |last=Jammer |author-link=Max Jammer |title=The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics |location=New York |publisher=American Institute of Physics |orig-year=1966 |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-88318-617-6 |oclc=300417620}}</ref>

====Creation of wave mechanics====
In January 1926, Schrödinger published in ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'' the paper "{{Lang|de|Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem}}" (Quantization as an [[Eigenvalue]] Problem)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schrodinger|first=Erwin|title=Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem|journal=[[Annalen der Physik]]|year=1926|volume=384|issue=4|pages=273–376|doi=10.1002/andp.19263840404|bibcode=1926AnP...384..361S|doi-access=}}</ref> on wave mechanics and presented what is now known as the Schrödinger equation. In this paper, he gave a "derivation" of the wave equation for time-independent systems and showed that it gave the correct energy eigenvalues for a hydrogen-like atom. This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century and created a revolution in most areas of quantum mechanics and indeed of all physics and chemistry. A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that solved the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]], [[rigid rotor]], and [[diatomic molecule]] problems and gave a new derivation of the Schrödinger equation. A third paper, published in May, showed the equivalence of his approach to that of [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]] and gave the treatment of the [[Stark effect]]. A fourth paper in this series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in scattering problems. In this paper, he introduced a complex solution to the wave equation in order to prevent the occurrence of fourth- and sixth-order differential equations. Schrödinger ultimately reduced the order of the equation to one.<ref>''[[The Dreams That Stuff Is Made Of]]: The Most Astounding Papers of Quantum Physics—and How They Shook the Scientific World'', [[Stephen Hawking]], (editor), the papers by Schrödinger.</ref>

Schrödinger was not entirely comfortable with the implications of quantum theory referring to his theory as "wave mechanics".<ref>Beller, Mara. “Matrix Theory before Schrodinger: Philosophy, Problems, Consequences.” Isis, vol. 74, no. 4, [The University of Chicago Press, The History of Science Society], 1983, pp. 469–91, http://www.jstor.org/stable/232208 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211006103703/https://www.jstor.org/stable/232208 |date=6 October 2021 }}. "The Gottingen-Copenhagen physicists, however, presented a united front. They cooperated intimately, each contributing extensively to the emergence of the new philosophy. The distribution of talents in the Gottingen-Copenhagen group could not have been better. The youthful vigor and brilliance of Heisenberg, together with the mathematical virtuosity of Dirac, Jordan, and Born, were balanced by Bohr's philosophical profundity and Pauli's penetrating critical mind."</ref><ref>Stone, A. Douglas (2013). "Confusion and Then Uncertainty." ''Einstein and the Quantum: The Quest of the Valiant Swabian''. Princeton University Press, pp. 268–78, http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgxvv.32."Ironically, Schrödinger was correct; his method was much more intuitive and visualizable than that of Heisenberg and Born, and it has become the overwhelmingly preferred method for presenting the subject. But with Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave-function, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and Bohr's mysterious complementarity principle, the 'Copenhagen interpretation' reigned supreme, and the term 'wave mechanics' disappeared; it was all quantum mechanics."</ref> He wrote about the probability interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, "I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it." (Just in order to ridicule the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, he contrived the famous thought experiment called [[Schrödinger's cat]] paradox<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/26/science/a-quantum-sampler.html |work=The New York Times |title=A Quantum Sampler |date=26 December 2005 |access-date=13 August 2021 |archive-date=15 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915080006/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/26/science/a-quantum-sampler.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and was said to have angrily complained to his students that "''now the damned Göttingen physicists use my beautiful wave mechanics for calculating their shitty matrix elements.''"<ref>[[Helmut Rechenberg|Rechenberg, Helmut]].

"Noch drastischer sollte Schrödinger seine Meinung im Züricher Seminar nach einem Vortrag über eine neue Arbeit der Konkurrenten ausgedrückt haben. Er setzte sich nachher leicht verzweifelt und verärgert auf die Straße und sagte: "''Jetzt benützen die verdammten Göttinger meine schöne Wellenmechanik zur Ausrechnung ihrer Scheiß-Matrixelemente.''"</ref>)

====Work on a unified field theory====
Following his work on quantum mechanics, Schrödinger devoted considerable effort to working on a [[unified field theory]] that would unite [[gravity]], [[electromagnetism]], and nuclear forces within the basic framework of [[general relativity]], doing the work with an extended correspondence with Albert Einstein.<ref name="Halpern">{{Cite web |last=Halpern |first=Paul |date=2015-04-01 |title=Battle of the Nobel Laureates |url=https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/battle-of-the-nobel-laureates-712d444610d3 |access-date=2023-10-13 |website=Starts With A Bang! |language=en |archive-date=7 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107011418/https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/battle-of-the-nobel-laureates-712d444610d3 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1947, he announced a result, "Affine Field Theory",<ref>Schrödinger, E., ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'', Vol. 51A (1947), [http://einstein-schrodinger.com/schrodingerI.html pp. 163–171] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406052716/http://einstein-schrodinger.com/schrodingerI.html |date=6 April 2015 }}. (accessed 3 November 2017)</ref> in a talk at the Royal Irish Academy, but the announcement was criticized by Einstein as "preliminary" and failed to lead to the desired unified theory.<ref name="Halpern" /> Following the failure of his attempt at unification, Schrödinger gave up his work on unification and turned to other topics. Additionally, Schrödinger reportedly never collaborated with a major physicist for the remainder of his career.<ref name="Halpern" />

===Color===
Schrödinger had a strong interest in [[psychology]], in particular [[color perception]] and [[colorimetry]] (German: ''{{Lang|de|Farbenmetrik}}''). He spent quite a few years of his life working on these questions and published a series of papers in this area:
* "Theorie der Pigmente von größter Leuchtkraft", ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'', (4), 62, (1920), 603–22 (Theory of Pigments with Highest Luminosity)
* "Grundlinien einer Theorie der Farbenmetrik im Tagessehen", ''Annalen der Physik'', (4), 63, (1920), 397–456; 481–520 (Outline of a theory of colour measurement for daylight vision)
* "Farbenmetrik", ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'', 1, (1920), 459–66 (Colour measurement).
* "Über das Verhältnis der Vierfarben- zur Dreifarben-Theorie", ''Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Klasse'', Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien, 134, 471, (On The Relationship of Four-Color Theory to Three-Color Theory).
* "Lehre von der strahlenden Energie", ''[[Johann Heinrich Jakob Müller|Müller]]-[[Claude Pouillet|Pouillets]] Lehrbuch der Physik und Meteorologie'', Vol 2, Part 1 (1926) (Thresholds of Color Differences).

His work on the psychology of color perception follows the step of [[Isaac Newton]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in the same area. Some of these papers have been translated into English and can be found in: ''Sources of Colour Science'', Ed. David L. MacAdam, MIT Press (1970) and in ''Erwin Schrödinger’s Color Theory, Translated with Modern Commentary'', Ed. Keith K. Niall, Springer (2017). {{ISBN|978-3-319-64619-0}} {{doi|10.1007/978-3-319-64621-3}}.

===Interest in philosophy===
Schrödinger had a deep interest in philosophy, and was influenced by the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]]. In his 1956 lecture "Mind and Matter", he said that "The world extended in [[space and time]] is but our [[mental representation|representation]]."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47010639 |title=What is life? : the physical aspect of the living cell; with Mind and matter; & Autobiographical sketches |date=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-511-00114-2 |location=Cambridge |oclc=47010639|page=136}}</ref> This is a repetition of the first words of Schopenhauer's main work. Schopenhauer's works also introduced him to [[Indian philosophy]], more specifically to the [[Upanishads]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]]’s interpretation. He once took on a particular line of thought: "If the world is indeed created by our act of observation, there should be billions of such worlds, one for each of us. How come your world and my world are the same? If something happens in my world, does it happen in your world, too? What causes all these worlds to synchronize with each other?".

<blockquote>There is obviously only one alternative, namely the unification of minds or consciousnesses. Their multiplicity is only apparent, in truth there is only one mind. This is the doctrine of the Upanishads.<ref name="Schrödinger">Schrödinger, Erwin. What is life? Epilogue: On Determinism and Free Will</ref></blockquote>Schrödinger discussed topics such as [[consciousness]], the [[mind–body problem]], [[sense perception]], [[free will]], and [[objective reality]] in his lectures and writings.<ref name="Schrödinger" /><ref>Schrödinger, Erwin.Mind and Matter</ref><ref>Schrödinger, Erwin. My View of the World</ref>

Schrödinger's attitude with respect to the relations between Eastern and Western thought was one of prudence, expressing appreciation for Eastern philosophy while also admitting that some of the ideas did not fit with empirical approaches to natural philosophy.<ref name="Bitbol">{{Cite journal|last=Bitbol|first=Michel|title=Schrödinger and Indian Philosophy|url=http://michel.bitbol.pagesperso-orange.fr/Schrodinger_India.pdf|journal=Cahiers du service culturel de l'ambassade de France en Inde, Allahabad, August 1999|pages=20|access-date=22 January 2022|archive-date=7 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307163951/http://michel.bitbol.pagesperso-orange.fr/Schrodinger_India.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Some commentators have suggested that Schrödinger was so deeply immersed in a non-dualist Vedântic-like view that it may have served as a broad framework or subliminal inspiration for much of his work including that in theoretical physics.<ref name="Bitbol" /> Schrödinger expressed sympathy for the idea of [[tat tvam asi|''Tat Tvam Asi'']], stating "you can throw yourself flat on the ground, stretched out upon [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]], with the certain conviction that you are one with her and she with you."<ref>Schrödinger, Erwin. ''My View of the World'', chapter iv, and ''What Is life?''</ref>

Schrödinger said that "Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else."<ref>"General Scientific and Popular Papers." In ''Collected Papers'', Vol. 4. Vienna: [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]].

==Legacy==
The philosophical issues raised by Schrödinger's cat are still debated today and remain his most enduring legacy in [[popular science]], while Schrödinger's equation is his most enduring legacy at a more technical level.
