'''Kaarlo Jaakko Juhani Hintikka''' (12 January 1929 – 12 August 2015) was a Finnish [[philosopher]] and [[logician]]. Hintikka is regarded as the founder of formal [[epistemic logic]] and of [[game semantics]] for logic.

==Life and career==
Hintikka was born in [[Helsingin maalaiskunta]] (now Vantaa).

In 1953, he received his doctorate from the [[University of Helsinki]] for a thesis entitled ''Distributive Normal Forms in the [[Predicate calculus|Calculus of Predicates]]''. He was a student of [[Georg Henrik von Wright]].

Hintikka was a Junior Fellow at [[Harvard University]] (1956-1969), and held several professorial appointments at the University of Helsinki, the Academy of Finland, [[Stanford University]], [[Florida State University]] and finally [[Boston University]] from 1990 until his death.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Floyd|first1=Juliet|url=http://www.bu.edu/philo/2015/08/13/professor-jaakko-hintikka-1929-2015/|title=Professor Jaakko Hintikka (1929-2015)|date=13 August 2015|website=Boston University Philosophy Department|publisher=Boston University|access-date=2 September 2015}}</ref> He was the prolific author or co-author of over 30 books and over 300 scholarly articles, Hintikka contributed to [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophical logic]], the [[philosophy of mathematics]], [[epistemology]], [[Philosophy of language|language theory]], and the [[philosophy of science]]. His works have appeared in over nine languages.

Hintikka edited the [[academic journal]] ''[[Synthese]]'' from 1962 to 2002, and was a consultant editor for more than ten journals. He was the first vice-president of the [[International Federation of Philosophical Societies|Fédération Internationale des Sociétés de Philosophie]], the vice-president of the [[Institut International de Philosophie]] (1993–1996), as well as a member of the [[American Philosophical Association]], the [[International Union of History and Philosophy of Science]], [[Association for Symbolic Logic]], and a member of the governing board of the [[Philosophy of Science Association]]. In 2005, he won the [[Rolf Schock Prize]] in logic and philosophy "for his pioneering contributions to the logical analysis of modal concepts, in particular the concepts of knowledge and belief". In 1985, he was president of the [[Florida Philosophical Association]].

He was a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40104 |title=Gruppe 3: Idéfag |publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] |language=no |access-date=16 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109221405/http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40104 |archive-date= 9 January 2015 }}</ref> On May 26, 2000, Hintikka received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of History and Philosophy at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/|title=Honorary doctorates - Uppsala University, Sweden|website=www.uu.se|access-date=10 April 2018}}</ref>

==Philosophical work==

Early in his career, he devised a [[semantics of modal logic]] essentially analogous to [[Saul Kripke]]'s [[Kripke semantics|frame semantics]], and discovered the now widely taught [[semantic tableau]], independently of [[Evert Willem Beth]]. Later, he worked mainly on game semantics, and on [[independence-friendly logic]], known for its "[[branching quantifier]]s", which he believed do better justice to our intuitions about [[Quantification (logic)|quantifiers]] than does conventional [[first-order logic]]. He did important exegetical work on [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Hintikka's work can be seen as a continuation of the analytic tendency in philosophy founded by [[Franz Brentano]] and Peirce, advanced by [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], and continued by [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], and by Hintikka's teacher [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]. For instance, in 1998 he wrote ''The Principles of Mathematics Revisited'', which takes an exploratory stance comparable to that Russell made with his ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' in 1903.
