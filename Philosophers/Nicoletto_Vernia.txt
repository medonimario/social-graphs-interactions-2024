'''Nicoletto Vernia''' (c. 1420, in [[Chieti]]<ref>James Hankins (2007). ''The Cambridge companion to Renaissance philosophy''. p. 358.</ref> – October 31, 1499, in [[Vicenza]]) was an Italian [[Averroist]] philosopher, at the [[University of Padua]].<ref>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-influence/ Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West]</ref>

==Life==
He studied at [[Pavia]], under [[Paolo da Pergola]] in [[Venice]], and with [[Gaetano da Thiene (philosopher)|Gaetano da Thiene]] in Padua, graduating with a doctorate in 1458. His first work was on the ''[[unitas intellectus]]'', the theory of Averroes on the unity of the [[soul]] and [[intellect]].<ref>Schmitt and Skinner, p. 839.</ref>

In [[natural philosophy]] he posed the question of the scope of the subject. Following Averroes, he took “mobile being” as the topic, against the scholastic views of [[Antonius Andreas]] and [[John Canonicus]].<ref>[[Edward Craig (philosopher)|Edward Craig]], ed., ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1998), p. 407.</ref> [[Pietro Barozzi]], [[Bishop of Padua]], in 1489 issued a decree limiting academic discussion, and Vernia had to withdraw from his position. He wrote against Averroes, in ''Contra perversam Averrois opinionem'', attacking his views on the [[immortality of the soul]] and the unity of the intellect.<ref>Deno John Geanakoplos, ''Constantinople and the West: Essays on the Late Byzantine (Palaeologan) and Italian Renaissances and the Byzantine and Roman Churches'' (1989), p. 119.</ref>

His students included [[Agostino Nifo]] and [[Pietro Pomponazzi]]. Both Vernia and Nifo changed allegiance from Averroes to the interpretations of [[Aristotle]] in certain Greek commentators, one of whom, [[Themistius]], was being translated by [[Ermolao Barbaro]], a colleague at Padua. As time went on, the commentary ''On the Soul'' by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] was translated into Latin, by [[Girolamo Donato]], and a translation of the commentary attributed to [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] was also circulated. Vernia's views of the correct interpretation of Aristotle modified in the light of access to these fresh opinions.<ref>Anthony Grafton and Nancy Siraisi (editors), Introduction p. 9, in ''Natural Particulars: Nature and the Disciplines in Renaissance Europe'' (1999).</ref><ref>Edward Craig, ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1998), p. 409.</ref><ref>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pomponazzi/ Pietro Pomponazzi]</ref>
