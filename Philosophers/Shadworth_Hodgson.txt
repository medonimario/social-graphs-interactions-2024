'''Shadworth Hollway Hodgson''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (25 December 1832 – 13 June 1912) was an [[England|English]] [[philosopher]].

==Biography==
He worked independently, without academic affiliation. He was acknowledged by [[William James]]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Perry |first=Ralph Barton |title=William James, Essays in Radical Empiricism |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=1996 |edition= |publication-date=1996 |pages=xv - xxv |chapter=Preface |author-link=Ralph Barton Perry |chapter-url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/James/James_1912/James_1912_pref.html}}</ref> as a forerunner of [[Pragmatism]], although he viewed his work as a completion of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] project.  Hodgson was a member of a London philosophy club with James, called the "Scratch Eight". Hodgson regarded the poets [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] as his chief inspirations, and had no academic background, though he was a member of the [[Metaphysical Society]].

He was the first president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] and held that post from 1880 to 1894.

His principal work was ''The Metaphysic of Experience'' (1898)<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5q05AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA216| pages=216–218 |title=Review of ''The Metaphysic of Experience'' by Shadworth H. Hodgson. 4 vols.|journal=The Athenaeum: Journal of Literature, Science, the Fine Arts, Music, and the Drama |issue=3746 |date=August 12, 1899 }}</ref> which prepared the way for New Realism. He objected to the stance of [[empiricism]] in its postulating of persons and things, and insisted that neither subject nor object are warranted as initial considerations of philosophy.

He died on 13 June 1912.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/53978664/shadworth-h-hodgson/ |title=Shadworth H. Hodgson |newspaper=[[Argus Leader]] |page=4 |date=1912-07-13 |access-date=2020-06-22 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

Hodgson believed in what he called the principle of reflective consciousness, namely that "A thing is what it is known as, this is the principle in its objective formula; 'the objective and subjective aspects are inseparable,' this is its subjective formula, expressing the way in which the same truth appears in reflection itself.".<ref>{{cite journal |author-link=William T. Parry |first=William T. |last=Parry |date=December 1955 |title=Are Things What They are Known As? |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2103777 |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=237–239 |doi=10.2307/2103777 |jstor=2103777 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

Attention to Hodgson was briefly enlivened by an article by [[Wolfe Mays]] in a British phenomenology journal in the 1970s.

The volumes of Hodgson's principal work were often shipped with uncut pages and visits to libraries with these volumes has revealed that sometimes most pages of all 4 volumes remained uncut even one hundred years later.
