[[File:Lubov_Axelrod.jpg|thumb|Lyubov Axelrod, 1887.]]

'''Lyubov Isaakovna Axelrod''' (born '''Esther Axelrod'''; {{langx|ru|Любо́вь (Эстер) Исаа́ковна Аксельро́д}}, penname '''Orthodox''' {{langx|ru|Ортодо́кс}}; 1868 – 5 February 1946) was a Russian revolutionary, [[Marxist]] [[philosopher]], literary critic and an art theoretician.

== Early life ==
Axelrod was born in the family of a [[rabbi]] in [[Pastavy Raion|Vilenkovichi]], a village in the [[Vilna]] [[gubernia]] of the [[Russian Empire]], now in [[Pastavy Raion]], [[Belarus]]. She became involved with the [[narodnik]] organization at age 16. She emigrated to [[Switzerland]] in 1887, with the assistance of [[Leo Jogiches]] (lover of [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) when the Vitebsk organisation collapsed in the wake of an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate [[Alexander III of Russia]] organised by [[Aleksandr Ulyanov]], older brother of [[Vladimir Lenin]].<ref name="Bukharin">{{cite book |last1=Schmidt |first1=O.Yu., Bukharin N.I. et al eds |title=Большая советская энциклопедия vol 2 |date=1926 |location=Moscow |page=29}}</ref>

== Political career ==
=== 1892 to 1918 ===
In 1892 she became a Marxist and joined the [[Geneva]]-based [[Emancipation of Labor]] group, becoming a close associate of its leader [[Georgi Plekhanov]]. In 1900, she received her [[Ph.D.]] in [[philosophy]] from [[University of Bern | Bern University]]. In 1902 she worked with Georgi Plekhanov and Lenin on the newspaper ''[[Iskra]]'', as a contributor and an organiser. When the [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]] split into [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]] at its [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party | Second Congress]] in 1903, she joined the Bolsheviks, but split with them soon afterwards, at the same time as  Plekhanov.

In 1906 Axelrod returned to Russia during an amnesty and became a leading Russian authority on Marxist philosophy, second only to Plekhanov, as well as working with the Mensheviks' illegal organisation. Her ''Philosophical Essays'', published in 1906, were acknowledged by both the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks as the definitive rebuttal of the 'neo-Kantians' [[Nikolai Berdyaev]] and [[Peter Struve |Pyotr Struve]], former Marxists who had broken with the revolutionaries.{{cn|date=February 2023}} She was critical both of [[Alexander Bogdanov]] and of [[Vladimir Lenin]] during their debate over [[Empiriocriticism]] in 1908–1909, branding their ideas as anti-Marxist. In 1910, in [[Saint Petersburg]], she joined the Central Trade Union Bureau, which was also illegal. After the outbreak of [[World War I|war]] in 1914, like Plekhanov, she argued that [[German Empire|Germany]] was the aggressor and that Russia had a right to defend itself. She teamed up with two other prominent Marxist 'defencists', [[Pyotr Maslov]] and [[Alexander Potresov|Aleksandr Potresov]] to produce the fortnightly journal {{lang | ru | Delo}} ('Fact'). After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 she joined the [[central committee]] of the Menshevik party, and following the [[October Revolution]] of November 1917 she was reunited with Plekhanov{{cn | reason = Who or what engineered the reunification?|date=February 2023}} in the small anti-Bolshevik group [[Yedinstvo]].<ref name="Bukharin" /> She abstained from party politics after the May 1918 death of Plekhanov, and made it her life's work to defend his philosophy.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Wetter |first1= Gustav |title= Dialectical Materialism: A Historical and Systematic Survey of Philosophy in the Soviet Union |date=1959 |publisher=Routledge and Regan Paul Ltd. |location=London}}</ref>

=== Later career ===
In the 1920s she first worked at the [[Institute of Red Professors]] and later at the [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences |Soviet Institute of Philosophy]]. Her appointment to lecture in philosophy at Sverdlov University,{{cn|date=February 2023}} in 1921, was originally blocked by the [[Orgburo]], but when Lenin was consulted he said that it should be allowed, on condition that she was kept under observation in case she started promoting [[Menshevism]]. In the 1930s her version of Marxism was officially denounced as a "Mechanistic revision of Marxism"<ref>
