He was an advocate of "exact philosophy"<ref name=Bunge2016/>{{rp|211}} and a critic of [[existentialist]], [[hermeneutical]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] philosophy, and [[postmodernism]].<ref name=Bunge2016/>{{rp|172}} He was popularly known for his opinions against [[pseudoscience]].

==Biography==
Bunge was born on September 21, 1919, in [[Florida Oeste, Buenos Aires]], Argentina.<ref name="Festschrift 2019"/>{{rp|1}} His mother, Marie Herminie Müser, was a German nurse who left Germany just before the beginning of [[World War I]].<ref name=Bunge2016/>{{rp|1–2}} His father, Augusto Bunge, also of some German descent, was an Argentine physician and socialist legislator.<ref name=Bunge2016/>{{rp|1–2}} Mario, who was the couple's only child, was raised without any religious education, and enjoyed a happy and stimulating childhood in the outskirts of Buenos Aires.<ref name=Bunge2016/>{{rp|1–22}}

Bunge had four children: Carlos F. and Mario A. J. (with ex-wife Julia), and Eric R. and Silvia A., with his wife of over 60 years, the Argentine mathematician [[Marta Cavallo]].<ref name=Bunge2016/>{{rp|5}} Mario lived with Marta in [[Montreal, Canada|Montreal]] from 1966 until his death, with one-year sabbaticals in other countries.<ref name=Bunge2016/>{{rp|413}}

=== Studies and career ===
Bunge began his studies at the [[National University of La Plata]], graduating with a PhD in physico-mathematical sciences in 1952.<ref name="GF"/> He was professor of [[theoretical physics]] and philosophy, 1956–1966, first at La Plata then at [[University of Buenos Aires]].<ref name="GF"/> His international debut was at the 1956 Inter-American Philosophical Congress in [[Santiago|Santiago, Chile]]. He was particularly noticed there by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], who called Bunge the star of the congress.{{R|"SI"}} He was, until his retirement at age 90, the Frothingham Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal, Canada|Montreal]], where he had been since 1966.<ref name="MG">{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/40/06/bunge/|title=Mario Bunge: Philosophy in flux |date=November 8, 2007|last=Spitzberg|first=Daniel|publisher=McGill Reporter|access-date=January 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213014250/https://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/40/06/bunge/|archive-date=December 13, 2007}}</ref><ref name="UO">{{cite web|url=https://www.uottawa.ca/publications/interscientia/biographies/bunge.html|title=Biography: Mario Bunge, PhD, FRSC|publisher=University of Ottawa|access-date=January 29, 2010|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215023240/http://www.uottawa.ca/publications/interscientia/biographies/bunge.html|archive-date=February 15, 2009}}</ref><ref name="GF">{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/2009-mario-a-bunge|title=Fellows: Mario A.

In a review of Bunge's 2016 memoirs, ''Between Two Worlds: Memoirs of a Philosopher-Scientist'',<ref name=Bunge2016/> [[James Alcock]] saw in Bunge "a man of exceedingly high confidence who has lived his life guided by strong principles about truth, science, and justice" and one who is "[impatient] with muddy thinking".<ref name="Alcock"/>

He became a [[centenarian]] in September 2019. A ''[[Festschrift]]'' was published to mark the occasion, with essays by an international collection of scholars.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Frazier |first=Kendrick |author-link=Kendrick Frazier |date=January–February 2020 |title=Science, Philosophy, and a Lifetime of Reason: A Mario Bunge Festschrift |magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |volume=44 |issue=1 |page=9}}</ref> He died in Montreal, Canada, on February 24, 2020, at the age of 100.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fallece a los cien años el filósofo argentino Mario Bunge |date=February 25, 2020 |newspaper=[[La Vanguardia]] |url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20200225/473778442527/fallece-mario-bunge-filosofo-argentino.html |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Muere a los 100 años el físico y filósofo argentino Mario Bunge |date=February 25, 2020 |work=[[CNN en Español]] |url=https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2020/02/25/alerta-muere-a-los-100-anos-el-fisico-y-filosofo-argentino-mario-bunge/ |language=es}}</ref>

==Work==
=== Philosophy ===
Bunge was a prolific intellectual, having written more than 400 papers and 80 books, notably his monumental ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy'' in eight volumes (1974–1989), a comprehensive and rigorous study of those philosophical aspects Bunge takes to be the core of modern philosophy: [[semantics]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of science]] and ethics.<ref name="GF"/> In his ''Treatise'', Bunge developed a comprehensive [[scientific]] outlook which he then applied to the various natural and social sciences.

His work is based on global [[systemics|systemism]], [[emergentism]], [[rationalism]], [[scientific realism]], [[materialism]] and [[consequentialism]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bunge |first=Mario |date=1989 |title=Ethics: The Good and the Right |series=Treatise on Basic Philosophy |volume=8 |location=Dordrecht; Boston |publisher=D. Reidel |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0zTwCAAAQBAJ&pg=PR14 xiv] |isbn=9027728399 |oclc=19354927 |doi=10.1007/978-94-009-2601-1 |quote=This is the last volume of my ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy'', on which I started to work two decades ago. It is consistent with the previous volumes, in particular with the naturalistic, dynamicist, emergentist and systemist ontology, as well as with the realistic and ratioempiricist semantics and epistemology formulated therein. }}</ref> Bunge repeatedly and explicitly denied being a [[logical positivism|logical positivist]],<ref>{{harvnb|Bunge|2016|pp=113, 335}}: "...&nbsp;mainly because of the vulgar confusion between scientism and positivism, I am often regarded as a positivist despite my many criticisms of positivism.&nbsp;... When [Gino] Germani invited me to take part in the panel for the conference on science and positivism that he had organized, I assaulted positivism and thus provoked Gino's anger. I had not realized that, in that milieu, positivism was confused with scientism.&nbsp;... I had read some of the genuine positivists, from Comte, Mach and Duhem to Reichenbach, Carnap and Philipp Rank, and had thoroughly criticized their attempt to interpret physics in anthropocentric terms, from sensation to measurement."</ref> and wrote on [[metaphysics]].<ref>See, for example, volumes 3 and 4 of his ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy''.</ref>

A variety of scientists and philosophers influenced his thought. Among those thinkers, Bunge explicitly acknowledged the direct influence of his own father, the Argentine physician Augusto Bunge, the Czech physicist [[Guido Beck]], the Argentine mathematician [[Alberto González Domínguez]], the Argentine mathematician, physicist and computer scientist [[Manuel Sadosky]], the Italian sociologist and psychologist [[:es:Gino Germani|Gino Germani]], the American sociologist [[Robert King Merton]], and the French-Polish epistemologist [[Émile Meyerson]].<ref name=Bunge2016/>

Among many frameworks that Bunge proposed was a five-stage model of the maturation of science from immature {{em|prescience}} to mature {{em|tetartoscience}}: see {{slink|Protoscience|Developmental stages of science}}.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bunge |first=Mario |chapter=Epistemic Change |date=1983 |title=Epistemology & Methodology II: Understanding the World |series=Treatise on Basic Philosophy |volume=6 |location=Dordrecht; Boston |publisher=[[D.

Popularly, he is known for his remarks considering [[psychoanalysis]] as an example of [[pseudoscience]].<ref>For example: {{cite journal |last1=Bud |first1=Robert |last2=Bunge |first2=Mario |date=October 2010 |title=For and against psychoanalysis: Is psychoanalysis science or pseudoscience? |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume=208 |issue=2780 |pages=22–23 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(10)62400-1 |url=https://www.realclearscience.com/2010/10/06/is_psychoanalysis_science_or_pseudoscience_237794.html}} See also: {{cite book |last=Bunge |first=Mario |date=2001 |chapter=Diagnosing pseudoscience |title=Philosophy in Crisis: The Need for Reconstruction |url=https://archive.org/details/philosophycrisis00mari |url-access=limited |series=Prometheus lectures |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |pages=[https://archive.org/details/philosophycrisis00mari/page/n149 161]–189 |isbn=1573928437 |oclc=45123524}}</ref> He was critical of the ideas of well known scientists and philosophers such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], and [[Daniel Dennett]].<ref name="Alcock">{{cite journal |last1=Alcock |first1=James |author-link1=James Alcock |title=The Scientist and the Philosopher |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |year=2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=58–61}}</ref>

Bunge appreciated some aspects of Popper's [[critical rationalism]] but found it insufficient as a comprehensive philosophy of science,<ref>See, for example:

Nor does critical rationalism, for which all hypotheses are groundless, none being better than any others except that some resist better the attempts at refuting them (Popper, 1959, 1963, 1974).}}

True, unsuccessful attempts to refute a theory (or discredit a proposal or an artifact) are more valuable than mere empirical confirmation. However, (a) the most general theories are not refutable, although they are indirectly confirmable by turning them into specific theories upon adjoining them specific hypotheses (Bunge, 1973b); (b) true (or approximately true) predictions are not that cheap, as shown by the predictive barrenness of pseudoscience; (c) positive evidence for the truth of an idea or the efficiency of a proposal, procedure, or artifact, does count: thus the US Food and Drug Administration will rightly demand positive evidence for the efficiency [efficacy] of a drug before permitting its marketing.}}</ref> and instead formulated his own account of [[scientific realism]].<ref>See, for example, among secondary sources:

John R. Wettersen, who defined "critical rationalism" more broadly than Popper's work, called Bunge's theory of science "a version of critical rationalism".<ref>{{cite IEP |url-id=cr-ratio |title=Karl Popper and Critical Rationalism |last=Wettersen |first=John R. |access-date=January 10, 2021}}</ref>

==== Philosophy of social sciences ====
Bunge addressed issues of theory and method in the social sciences starting with his ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy'' and later in his career wrote two books entirely focused on the social sciences: ''Finding Philosophy in Social Science'' (1996) and ''Social Science under Debate: A Philosophical Perspective'' (1998). In these works he argued for an approach to the study of societies that he called systemism, an alternative to holism and individualism. He was an advocate for what he called mechanismic explanations and defended the view that social mechanisms are processes "in a concrete system, such that it is capable of bringing about or preventing some change in the system as a whole or in some of its subsystems".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bunge |first=Mario |title=Mechanism and Explanation |journal=[[Philosophy of the Social Sciences (journal)|Philosophy of the Social Sciences]] |volume=27 |issue=4 |year=1997 |pages=410–465 (414) |doi=10.1177/004839319702700402|s2cid=143549022 }}</ref>
