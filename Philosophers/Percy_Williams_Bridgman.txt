'''Percy Williams Bridgman''' (April 21, 1882 – August 20, 1961) was an American [[List of physicists|physicist]] who received the 1946 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on the physics of high pressures. He also wrote extensively on the [[scientific method]] and on other aspects of the [[philosophy of science]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.3057180 | title = Percy W.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bridgman was born in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and grew up in nearby [[Auburndale, Massachusetts|Auburndale]].<ref name="Kemble">{{cite book | last1 = Kemble | first1 = Edwin C. | last2 = Birch | first2 = Francis | title = Percy Williams Bridgman – 1882—1961 | publisher = National Academy of Sciences | year = 1970 | url = http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/bridgman-percy-w.pdf | pages = 25, 26, 27}}</ref>

Bridgman's parents were both born in New England.  His father, Raymond Landon Bridgman, was "profoundly religious and idealistic" and worked as a newspaper reporter assigned to state politics. His mother, Mary Ann Maria Williams, was described as "more conventional, sprightly, and competitive".<ref name="Kemble"/>

Bridgman attended both elementary and high school in Auburndale, where he excelled at competitions in the classroom, on the playground, and while playing chess.  Described as both shy and proud, his home life consisted of family music, card games, and domestic and garden chores.  The family was deeply religious; reading the Bible each morning and attending a [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]].<ref name="Kemble"/> However, Bridgman later became an atheist.<ref>Ray Monk (2013). ''Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center''. Random House LLC. {{ISBN|9780385504133}}. In many ways they were opposites; Kemble, the theorist, was a devout Christian, while Bridgman, the experimentalist, was a strident atheist.</ref>

===Education and professional life===
Bridgman entered [[Harvard University]] in 1900, and studied [[physics]] through to his [[PhD]]. From 1910 until his retirement, he taught at Harvard, becoming a full professor in 1919. In 1905, he began investigating the properties of matter under [[high pressure]]. A machinery malfunction led him to modify his pressure apparatus; the result was a new sealing device enabling him to create pressures eventually exceeding 100,000 [[kilogram-force|kgf]]/cm<sup>2</sup> (10 [[gigapascal|GPa]]; 100,000 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]]). This was a huge improvement over previous machinery, which could achieve pressures of only 3,000 kgf/cm<sup>2</sup> (0.3 GPa).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1946/ceremony-speech/|title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 1946}}</ref> This new apparatus led to an abundance of new findings, including a study of the compressibility, electric and [[thermal conductivity]], [[tensile strength]] and [[viscosity]] of more than 100 different compounds.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Bridgman is also known for his studies of electrical conduction in metals and properties of crystals. He developed the [[Bridgman seal]] and is the eponym for [[Bridgman's thermodynamic equations]], which were used to further his research.

Bridgman made many improvements to his high-pressure apparatus over the years, and unsuccessfully attempted the [[Synthetic diamond|synthesis of diamond]] many times.<ref>{{Citation | last=Hazen | first=Robert | title=The Diamond Makers | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=1999 | isbn=0-521-65474-2 }}</ref> The [[high-pressure torsion]] apparatus developed by Bridgman <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaveh Edalati, Zenji Horita|date=2016|title=A review on high-pressure torsion (HPT) from 1935 to 1988.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285216434|journal= Materials Science and Engineering: A|volume=0921-5093|pages=325–352|doi=10.1016/j.msea.2015.11.074}}</ref> significantly contributed to the development of [[severe plastic deformation]] field decades later.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edalati|first=K.|author2=Bachmaier, A. |author3=Beloshenko, V.A. |author4=Beygelzimer, Y. |author5=Blank, V.D. |author6=Botta, W.J. |author7=Bryła, K. |author8=Čížek, J. |author9=Divinski, S. |author10=Enikeev, N.A. |author11=Estrin, Y. |author12=Faraji, G. |author13=Figueiredo, R.B. |author14=Fuji, M. |author15=Furuta, T. |author16=Grosdidier, T. |author17=Gubicza, J. |author18=Hohenwarter, A. |author19= Horita, Z. |author20=Huot, J. |author21=Ikoma, Y. |author22=Janeček, M. |author23=Kawasaki, M. |author24=Krǎl, P. |author25=Kuramoto, S. |author26=Langdon, T.G. |author27=Leiva, D.R. |author28=Levitas, V.I. |author29=Mazilkin, A. |author30=Mito, M. |author31=Miyamoto, H. |author32=Nishizaki, T. |author33=Pippan, R. |author34=Popov, V.V. |author35=Popova, E.N. |author36=Purcek, G. |author37=Renk, O. |author38=Révész, A. |author39=Sauvage, X. |author40=Sklenicka, V. |author41=Skrotzki, W. |author42=Straumal, B.B. |author43=Suwas, S. |author44=Toth, L.S. |author45=Tsuji, N. |author46=Valiev, R.Z. |author47=Wilde, G. |author48=Zehetbauer, M.J. |author49=Zhu, X. |title=Nanomaterials by severe plastic deformation: review of historical developments and recent advances|journal=Materials Research Letters|date=April 2022|volume=10|issue=4|pages=163–256|doi=10.1080/21663831.2022.2029779|s2cid=246959065 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

His [[philosophy of science]] book ''[[The Logic of Modern Physics]]'' (1927) advocated [[operationalism]] and coined the term [[operational definition]]. In 1938 he participated in the International Committee composed to organise the International Congresses for the Unity of Science.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Neurath|first1=Otto|title=Unified Science as Encyclopedic Integration|journal=[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]|date=1938|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–27}}</ref> He was also one of the 11 signatories to the [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]].

[[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], the director of the [[Manhattan Project]], was an undergraduate student of Bridgman's. Of his teaching abilities, Oppenheimer said that, “I found Bridgman a wonderful teacher because he never really was quite reconciled to things being the way they were and he always thought them out.”<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bird |first=Kai |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/695567255 |title=American Prometheus: the triumph and tragedy of J.

===Home life and death===
[[File:Percy Bridgman with wife and Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden 1946.jpg|thumb|upright|Bridgman with wife and [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden]] in Stockholm in 1946]]
Bridgman married Olive Ware (1882-1972), of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], in 1912.  Ware's father, [[Edmund Asa Ware]], was the founder and first president of [[Atlanta University]]. The couple had two children and were married for nearly 50 years, living most of that time in Cambridge.  The family also had a summer home in [[Randolph, New Hampshire]], where Bridgman was known as a skilled mountain climber.<ref name="Kemble"/>

Bridgman was a "penetrating analytical thinker" with a "fertile mechanical imagination" and exceptional manual dexterity.  He was a skilled plumber and carpenter, known to shun the assistance of professionals in these matters.  He was also fond of music and played the piano, and took pride in his flower and vegetable gardens.<ref name="Kemble"/>

Bridgman committed suicide by gunshot after suffering from [[Metastasis|metastatic]] [[cancer]] for some time. His suicide note was a mere two sentences; "It isn't decent for society to make a man do this thing himself. Probably this is the last day I will be able to do it myself."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holton |first1=Gerald |title=Percy Williams Bridgman |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=1 February 1962 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=22–23 |doi=10.1080/00963402.1962.11454315 |bibcode=1962BuAtS..18b..22H |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00963402.1962.11454315 |access-date=20 October 2021 |ref=PWBHolton}}</ref><ref>Nuland, Sherwin.
