'''Georg Bernhard Bilfinger''' (23 January 1693 – 18 February 1750), [[German people|German]] philosopher, mathematician and statesman, son of a [[Lutheran]] minister.

==Life==
He was born at [[Cannstatt]] in the [[Duchy of Württemberg]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

As a boy he showed great aptitude for study, and at first devoted himself to [[theology]], but under the influence of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]'s writings he took up mathematics and philosophy on the lines of Wolff and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Returning to theology, he attempted to connect it with philosophy in a treatise, ''Dilucidationes philosophicae, de deo, anima humana, mundo'' (Tübingen, 1725, 1746, 1768). This work contains nothing original but giving a clear representation of Wolff's philosophy. It met with great success, and the author was appointed to the office of preacher at the castle of [[Tübingen]] and of reader in the school of theology.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1721, after two years study under Wolff, he became professor of philosophy at [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], and in 1724 professor of mathematics. His friends at Tübingen disapproved of his new views, and in 1725, on Wolff's recommendation, he was invited by [[Peter I of Russia]] to lecture in [[Saint Petersburg]], where he was well received. His success in winning the prize of a thousand crowns offered for a dissertation on the cause of [[gravity]] by the [[Académie des Sciences]] of [[Paris]] secured his return to his native land in 1731.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1735, largely on account of his knowledge of military engineering, [[Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg]] (reigned 1733–1737) made him a [[privy councillor]], but his hands were tied owing to the frivolous atmosphere of the court. On the death of the duke, however, he became a member of the Regency Council, and devoted himself with energy and success to the reorganization of the state. In the departments of education, state-religion, agriculture and commerce, his administration was uniformly successful, and he became in a real sense the head of the state. He died at [[Stuttgart]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After his return from [[Imperial Russia]], he won the highest respect at home and abroad, and [[Frederick II of Prussia]] is recorded to have said of him, "He was a great man whom I shall ever remember with admiration."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Beside the ''Dilucidationes'', he wrote ''De harmonia animi et corporis humani commentatio'' (Frankfurt and Leipzig, 1735; Tübingen, 1741); ''De origine et permissione mali'' (1724), an account of the Leibnitzian theodicy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
