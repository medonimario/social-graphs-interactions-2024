'''Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz''' (12 December 1890 – 12 April 1963) was a Polish [[philosopher]] and [[logician]], a prominent figure in the [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic]]. He originated many novel ideas in [[semantics]]. Among these was [[categorial grammar]], a highly flexible framework for the analysis of natural language syntax and (indirectly) semantics that remains a major influence on work in [[formal linguistics]]. Ajdukiewicz's fields of research were [[model theory]] and the [[philosophy of science]].

==Biography==
Ajdukiewicz was born in 1890 in Tarnopol in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], which at that time, due to [[Partitions of Poland]], was annexed by [[Austria-Hungary]] ([[Austrian Partition|The Austrian Partition]]). His father was a senior civil servant. Ajdukiewicz studied at the [[University of Lwów]], and lectured there, as well as in Warsaw and in Poznań. He received his PhD degree with the thesis on [[Kant]]'s philosophy of space. He was Rector of the University of Poznań from 1948 to 1952. He was one of the founders of the journal ''[[Studia Logica]]'' in its current incarnation, editing it from 1953 to his death.

==Work==
In his early epistemological system, which he called Radical Conventionalism, Ajdukiewicz analyzed any [[language]] as a set of expressions or sentences, with inferential ''rules of meaning'' that specify the relation of one expression to another, or to external data. There are three kinds of rules: Axiomatic, Deductive, and Empirical. Following the rules, one can map all knowable sentences of a language. However, some languages' vocabularies can produce ''disconnected'' sentences, which are only partly mapped by the ''meaning rules''. Therefore, when one uses a language, even scientific one, a ''conceptual apparatus'', an untranslatable set of meanings, is needed too, and with it a choice of the problems to be settled. For this reason the theory is a form of [[conventionalism]], and it is radical because even simple experiential reports are exposed to these language-wide considerations. Ajdukiewicz discarded this theory as the 1930s progressed.
