'''William Ernest Johnson''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (23 June 1858 – 14 January 1931), usually cited as '''W. E.

==Life and career==
Johnson was born in Cambridge on 23 June 1858 to William Henry Farthing Johnson and his wife, Harriet (''née'' Brimley).<ref name=":0" /> He was their fifth child.<ref name=":0" /> The family were Baptists and political liberals.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Broad |first=C.

He attended the Llandaff House School, Cambridge where his father was the proprietor and headteacher, then the [[The Perse School|Perse School]], Cambridge, and the Liverpool Royal Institution School.<ref name=":0">{{cite ODNB |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/DNB/Johnson.html |title=Johnson, William Ernest (1858–1931) |last1=Braithwaite |first1=R.

Due to this his education was frequently disrupted.<ref name=":1" />

In 1879 he entered [[King's College, Cambridge]] to read mathematics having won a scholarship and was placed 11th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] in 1882.<ref name=":2" /> He stayed on to study for the Moral Sciences Tripos from which he graduated in 1883 with a First Class degree.<ref name=":2">{{acad|id=JHN878WE|name=Johnson, William Ernest}}</ref>  He was also a [[Cambridge Apostle]].<ref>First semester.

In 1895 he married Barbara Keymer. After her sudden death in 1904 his sister Fanny moved in with him to care for his two sons.<ref name=":0" />

Having failed to win a prize fellowship, he taught mathematics. His first teaching post was as a lecturer in Psychology and Education at the [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge#History|Cambridge Women's Training College]], which he held for several years.<ref name=":1" /> He was a University Teacher of Theory of Education 1893-98 and, from 1896 until 1901, University Lecturer in Moral Sciences at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> In 1902 he was elected a [[Fellow]] of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], and appointed to the (newly-created) [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]] Lecturership, positions he held until his death.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" /> In 1923 he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]].<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" />

Johnson, who suffered poor health, published little. That, though "very able", he was "lacking in vigour" and had "published almost nothing" is a matter Bertrand Russell commented upon unsympathetically in a letter to [[Lady Ottoline Morrell|Ottoline Morrell]] of 23 February 1913.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LU6heg3jfHcC&q=very+able%2C+but+lacking+in+vigour%2C+and+has+published+almost+nothing&pg=PA433|title=The selected letters of Bertrand Russell.

Johnson ... is very able, but lacking in vigour, and has published almost nothing. His family make a cult of him, and talk as if having the ideas were everything, and writing them out a mere vulgar mechanical labour. It vexes me, because anybody who has ever written knows the intolerable labour of getting one's ideas into proper shape, long after they have seemed all right as mere thoughts. Universities are full of people who ought to write and don't — I always feel annoyed with them, and with people who minimize the labour of actually producing something.}}</ref> Johnson's obituary in ''[[The Times]],'' penned by [[J.

This work may never have been published if it had not been for the efforts of Newnham student Naomi Bentwich (1891–1988).<ref name=":1" /> Bentwich persuaded him to publish, typed and co-edited the manuscript and encouraged him to finish the project.  The preface to the first volume carries the acknowledgement: "I have to express my great obligations to my former pupil, Miss Naomi Bentwich, without whose encouragement and valuable assistance in the composition and arrangement of the work, it would not have been produced in its present form".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=W.

The article begins as follows:

<blockquote>
"As a material machine economises the exertion of force, so a symbolic calculus economises the exertion of intelligence ... the more perfect the calculus, the smaller the intelligence compared to the results."

[[A. N. Prior]]'s ''Formal Logic'' cites this article several times.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Prior|first1=A. N.|title=Determinables, Determinates and Determinants|journal=Mind|year=1949|volume=58|issue=229|pages=1–20|jstor=2254522|doi=10.1093/mind/lviii.229.1|pmid=18113196}}</ref>

[[John Passmore]] tells us:
<blockquote>
"His neologisms, as rarely happens, have won wide acceptance: such phrases as "ostensive definition", such contrasts as those between ...
