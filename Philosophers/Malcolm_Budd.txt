== Biography ==
Budd studied mathematics and philosophy at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]]. He taught at [[University College London]] from 1970 until 2001, and was appointed the [[Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic]] from 1998 until his retirement.<ref name="fba">{{cite web |title=Professor Malcolm Budd |url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/fellows/malcolm-budd-FBA |website=The British Academy |language=en |access-date=10 January 2019}}</ref> He now holds an [[emeritus]] position.<ref>{{cite web |title=Malcolm Budd |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy/people/emeritus-professors/malcolm-budd |website=UCL Philosophy |date=26 July 2018 |language=en |access-date=10 January 2019}}</ref>

He is best known for his work in analytic [[aesthetics]]. He has published work on the expressive powers of music, the aesthetic appreciation of nature, and the values of art.

Regarding the expressive powers of (purely instrumental) music, Budd is known for defending a type of resemblance theory, such that music resembles some feature of emotions. However, unlike [[Peter Kivy]] and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]], Budd argues that music resembles the way that emotions feel.

Budd was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] in 1995.<ref name="fba"/>
