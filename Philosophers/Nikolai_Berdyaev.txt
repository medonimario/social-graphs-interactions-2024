==Biography==

Nikolai Berdyaev was born near [[Kiev]] in 1874 to an [[aristocratic]] [[military]] family.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicolaus |first=Georg |title=C.G.

Almost all of Alexander Mikhailovich's ancestors served as high-ranking military officers, but he resigned from the army quite early and became active in the social life of the aristocracy. Nikolai's mother, Alina Sergeevna Berdyaeva, was half-French and came from the top levels of both French and Russian nobility. He also had [[Polish people|Polish]] and [[Tatar people|Tatar]] origins.<ref>Young, George M.

Berdyaev decided on an intellectual career and entered the [[Kiev University]] in 1894. It was a time of revolutionary fervor among the students and the [[intelligentsia]]. He became a [[Marxism|Marxist]] for a period and was arrested in a student demonstration and expelled from the university. His involvement in illegal activities led in 1897 to three years of internal [[exile]] to [[Vologda]] in northern Russia.<ref name = "Markovic"/>{{rp|28}}

A fiery 1913 article, entitled "Quenchers of the Spirit", criticising the rough purging of [[Imiaslavie]] Russian monks on [[Mount Athos]] by the [[Holy Synod]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] using tsarist troops, caused him to be charged with the crime of [[blasphemy]], the punishment for which was exile to [[Siberia]] for life. The [[World War I|World War]] and the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] prevented the matter coming to trial.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Self-Knowledge: An Essay in Autobiography'', by Nicolas Berdyaev (Author), Katharine Lampert (Translator), Boris Jakim (Foreword) {{ISBN|1597312584}}.</ref>

Berdyaev's disaffection culminated, in 1919, with the foundation of his own private academy, the ''"Free Academy of Spiritual Culture"''. It was primarily a forum for him to lecture on the hot topics of the day and to present them from a Christian point of view. He also presented his opinions in public lectures, and every Tuesday, the academy hosted a meeting at his home because [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|official Soviet anti-religious activity was intense]] at the time and the official policy of the Bolshevik government, with its [[Soviet anti-religious legislation]], strongly promoted [[state atheism]].<ref name = "Markovic"/>

In 1920, Berdiaev became professor of philosophy at the [[University of Moscow]]. In the same year, he was accused of participating in a conspiracy against the government; he was arrested and jailed. The feared head of the [[Cheka]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], came in person to interrogate him,<ref name="Gulag1">{{cite book | last = Solzhenitsyn | first = Aleksandr | author-link = Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn | title = The Gulag Archipelago, 1918–1956: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, I–II | year = 1973 | publisher = [[Harper & Row]] | chapter = Chapter 3 The Interrogation | isbn = 978-0060803322 | chapter-url-access = registration | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/gulagarchipelago00solz_0 }}</ref>{{rp|130}} and he gave his interrogator a solid dressing down on the problems with Bolshevism.<ref name = "Markovic"/>{{rp|32}} Novelist [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] in his book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' recounts the incident as follows:
<blockquote>
[Berdyaev] was arrested twice; he was taken in 1922 for a midnight interrogation with [[Felix Dzerzhinsky|Dzerjinsky]]; [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]] was also there.... But Berdyaev did not humiliate himself, he did not beg, he firmly professed the moral and religious principles by virtue of which he did not adhere to the party in power; and not only did they judge that there was no point in putting him on trial, but he was freed. Now there is a man who had a "point of view"!<ref>Cited by Markovic, op. cit., p.33, footnote 36.</ref>
</blockquote>

After being expelled from Russia, Berdyaev and other émigrés went to [[Berlin]], where he founded an academy of philosophy and religion, but economic and political conditions in the [[Weimar Republic]] caused him and his wife to move to [[Paris]] in 1923. He transferred his academy there, and taught, lectured and wrote, working for an exchange of ideas with the [[France|French]] and European intellectual community, and participated in a number of international conferences.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Conference in Austria |url=http://www.berdyaev.com/berdiaev/berd_lib/1927_323.html |access-date=21 July 2022 |website=www.berdyaev.com}}</ref>

==Philosophical work==
According to Marko Markovic, Berdyaev "was an ardent man, rebellious to all authority, an independent and "negative" spirit. He could assert himself only in negation and could not hear any assertion without immediately negating it, to such an extent that he would even be able to contradict himself and to attack people who shared his own prior opinions".<ref name = "Markovic">Marko Marković, ''La Philosophie de l'inégalité et les idées politiques de Nicolas Berdiaev'' (Paris: Nouvelles Editions Latines, 1978).</ref> According to Marina Makienko, Anna Panamaryova, and Andrey Gurban, Berdyaev's works are "emotional, controversial, bombastic, affective and dogmatic".<ref name="Makienko">{{cite journal |author1=Makienko, Marina|author2= Panamaryova, Anna|author3= Gurban, Andrey |title=Special Understanding of Gender Issues in Russian Philosophy |journal=Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences |date=7 January 2015 |volume=166 |pages=18–23 |doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.12.476 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |language=en|doi-access=free }}</ref>{{rp|20}} They summarise that, according to Berdyaev, "man unites two worlds – the world of the divine and the natural world. ... Through the freedom and creativity the two natures must unite... To overcome the dualism of existence is possible only through creativity.<ref name="Makienko" />{{rp|20}}

David Bonner Richardson described Berdyaev's philosophy as [[Christian existentialism]] and [[personalism]].<ref>{{cite book | chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-8870-8_3 | doi=10.1007/978-94-011-8870-8_3 | chapter=Existentialism: A Personalist Philosophy of History | title=Berdyaev's Philosophy of History | date=1968 | last1=Richardson | first1=David Bonner | pages=90–137 | isbn=978-94-011-8210-2 }}</ref> Other authors, such as political theologian Tsoncho Tsonchev, interpret Berdyaev as "[[Communitarianism|communitarian]] personalist" and [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]]. According to Tsonchev, Berdyaev's philosophical thought rests on four "pillars": freedom, creativity, person, and communion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tsonchev |first1=Tsoncho |title=Person and communion: the political theology of Nikolai Berdyaev |date=2021 |publisher=McGill University |location=McGill University’s institutional digital repository |url=https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jh19g |access-date=19 March 2022}}</ref>

One of the central themes of Berdyaev's work was [[philosophy of love]].<ref name="Shestakov">{{cite book |last1=Shestakov |first1=Vyacheslav |author-link1=Vyacheslav Shestakov |editor1-last=Шестаков |editor1-first=В.П. |title=Русский Эрос, или Философия любви в России |trans-title=Russian Eros, Or Philosophy of Love in Russia |url=https://predanie.ru/shestakov-vyacheslav-pavlovich/russkiy-eros-ili-filosofiya-lyubvi-v-rossii/chitat/ |date=1991 |publisher=[[Progress Publishers]]|pages=5–18 |access-date=14 March 2021 |language=ru |chapter=Вступительная статья |archive-date=24 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210924133203/https://predanie.ru/shestakov-vyacheslav-pavlovich/russkiy-eros-ili-filosofiya-lyubvi-v-rossii/chitat/ |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|11}} At first he systematically developed his theory of love in a special article published in the journal ''Pereval'' ({{langx|ru|Перевал}}) in 1907.<ref name="Shestakov" /> Then he gave [[gender]] issues a notable place in his book ''The Meaning of the Creative Act'' (1916).<ref name="Shestakov" /> According to him, 1) erotic energy is an eternal source of creativity, 2) [[eroticism]] is linked to beauty, and [[eros]] means search for the beautiful.<ref name="Shestakov" />{{rp|11}}

He also published works about Russian history and the Russian national character. In particular, he wrote about [[Russian nationalism]]:<ref>Quoted from book by [[Benedikt Sarnov]], ''Our Soviet Newspeak: A Short Encyclopedia of Real Socialism.'', pp. 446–447.

Though sometimes quoted as a [[Christian anarchist]] for his emphasis on theology and critique of statist and Marxist socialism, Berdyaev did not self-identify as such and differentiated himself from Tolstoy.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK-7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PT49 |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |date=17 February 2022 |edition=Abridged |publisher=Andrews UK Limited |isbn=978-1-84540-663-9 }}</ref>

==Theology and relations with Russian Orthodox Church==
Berdyaev was a member of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]],<ref name=witte/><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Berdyaev, Orthodox religious philosopher, dies in Paris |magazine=The Living Church | publisher=Morehouse-Gorham Company | volume=116 | year=1948 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zErkAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA6-PA8 | ref={{sfnref|The Living Church|1948}}|page=8|quote=a devout member of Russian Orthodox Church}}</ref> and believed Orthodoxy was the religious tradition closest to [[early Christianity]].{{sfn|Berdyaev|1952}}{{rp|at unk.|quote="Orthodoxy is that form of Christianity which suffered the least distortion in its substance as a result of human history.... Out of all forms of Christianity, it is the Orthodox Church which remained more closely tied to early Christianity."}}

Nicholas Berdyaev was an Orthodox Christian, however, it must be said that he was an independent and somewhat a "liberal" kind. Berdyaev also criticized the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and described his views as [[anticlerical]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Yet he considered himself closer to Orthodoxy than either Catholicism or Protestantism. According to him, "I can not call myself a typical Orthodox of any kind; but Orthodoxy was near to me (and I hope I am nearer to Orthodoxy) than either Catholicism or Protestantism. I never severed my link with the Orthodox Church, although confessional self-satisfaction and exclusiveness are alien to me."<ref name=witte>{{cite book |last1=Witte |first1=John |last2=Alexander |first2=Frank S. |title=The Teachings of Modern Orthodox Christianity on Law, Politics, and Human Nature |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-231-14265-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THpyJ0jBeH0C&pg=PA111|pages=111–112 }}</ref>

The aftermath of the Russian Revolution and Civil War, along with Soviet efforts towards the [[Decree on Separation of Church and State|separation of church and state]], caused the Russian Orthodox émigré diaspora to splinter into three Russian Church jurisdictions: the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] (separated from Moscow Patriarchate until 2007), the parishes under Metropolitan [[Eulogius (Georgiyevsky)]] that went under the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], and parishes that remained under the [[Moscow Patriarchate]]. Berdyaev was among those that chose to remain under the omophorion of the [[Moscow Patriarchate]]. He is mentioned by name on the Korsun/Chersonese Diocesan history as among those noted figures who supported the Moscow Patriarchate West-European Eparchy (in France now Korsun eparchy).<ref>{{cite web |title=ИСТОРИЯ ЕПАРХИИ |url=https://www.cerkov-ru.eu/istoriya-eparhii/ |access-date=17 May 2018 |website=Cerkov-ru.eu |archive-date=28 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428182200/https://www.cerkov-ru.eu/istoriya-eparhii/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1901 Berdyaev opened his literary career so to speak by work on ''Subjectivism and Individualism in Social Philosophy''. In it, he analyzed a movement then beginning in [[Imperial Russia]] that "at the beginning of the twentieth-century Russian Marxism split up; the more cultured Russian Marxists went through a spiritual crisis and became founders of an idealist and religious movement, while the majority began to prepare the advent of Communism". He wrote "over twenty books and dozens of articles."<ref>Steeves, P.D. (2001) "Berdyaev, Nikolai Aleksandrovich (1874–1948)" in [[Walter A.
