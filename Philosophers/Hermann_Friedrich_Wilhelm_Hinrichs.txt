'''Hermann Friedrich Wilhelm Hinrichs''' (22 April 1794 – 17 September 1861) was a German [[right Hegelian]] [[philosopher]].

==Biography==
Hinrichs was the son of a Protestant pastor. He studied [[theology]] at [[University of Strassburg|Strassburg]], and, following a crisis of faith, philosophy at [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] under [[Georg Hegel|Hegel]], who wrote a preface to his ''Religion im innern Verhältniss zur Wissenschaft'' (Heidelberg, 1822),<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Hinrichs, Hermann Friedrich Wilhelm|volume=13|page=515}}</ref> describing Hinrichs's work as turgid and difficult to follow. Hinrichs was convinced that philosophy was superior to theology in knowing and reconciling with God.

He became a [[Privatdozent]] in 1819, and held professorships at [[university of Breslau|Breslau]] (1822) and [[university of Halle|Halle]] (1824),<ref name="EB1911"/> which were important centers of Hegelianism outside Berlin.
