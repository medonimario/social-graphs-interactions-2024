'''Thomas Spencer Baynes''' (24 March 1823 – 31 May 1887) was an English [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Baynes was born in [[Wellington, Somerset]] to a [[Baptist]] minister.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Thomas Spencer Baynes {{!}} British scholar and editor {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Spencer-Baynes|access-date=2021-12-11|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}}</ref> He intended to study for Baptist ministry, and was at a theological seminary at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] with that view but, being strongly attracted to philosophical studies, left it and went to [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], where he became the favourite pupil of [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]], of whose philosophical system he continued an adherent.{{sfn|Cousin|1910}}

After working as editor of a newspaper in Edinburgh, and after an interval of rest rendered necessary by a breakdown in health, Baynes resumed journalistic work in 1858 as assistant editor of the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]''. In 1864 he was appointed Professor of [[Logic]] and [[English Literature]] at [[St Andrews University]], in which capacity his mind was drawn to the study of [[Shakespeare]], and he contributed to the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' and ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' valuable papers (chiefly relating to his vocabulary and the extent of his learning) afterwards collected as ''[[Shakespeare Studies]]''.{{sfn|Cousin|1910}}

In 1873, he was appointed to superintend the ninth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', a task with which, after 1880, he was assisted by [[William Robertson Smith]].{{sfn|Cousin|1910}} Baynes was the first English-born editor of the ''Britannica''; all earlier editors were Scottish.
