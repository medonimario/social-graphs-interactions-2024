'''Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak'''  (IPA: gaĕòttri t͡ʃɔkkròbòr(t)ti)  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 24 February 1942) is an Indian [[Scholarly method|scholar]], [[Literary theory|literary theorist]], and [[Feminist Criticism|feminist critic]].<ref>"Spivak, Gayatri."

Considered one of the most influential [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] [[intellectual]]s, Spivak is best known for her essay "Can the Subaltern Speak?" and her translation of and introduction to [[Jacques Derrida]]'s ''[[Of Grammatology|De la grammatologie]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hurBgAAQBAJ&q=%22one+of+the+most+influential+postcolonial+intellectuals%22+Spivak&pg=PA210|title=From Agamben to Zizek: Contemporary Critical Theorists: Contemporary Critical Theorists|last=Simons|first=Jon|date=2010-09-10|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748643264|language=en|access-date=17 October 2020|archive-date=17 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220717125801/https://books.google.com/books?id=3hurBgAAQBAJ&q=%22one+of+the+most+influential+postcolonial+intellectuals%22+Spivak&pg=PA210|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=Stephen|editor1-last=Simons|editor1-first=Jon|title=From Agamben To Zizek Contemporary Critical Theorists|date=2010|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7486-3973-1|page=210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0wTTPRsPv8C|language=en|access-date=17 October 2020|archive-date=7 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407011737/https://books.google.com/books?id=b0wTTPRsPv8C|url-status=live}}</ref> She has also translated many works of [[Mahasweta Devi]] into English, with separate critical notes on Devi's life and writing style, notably ''Imaginary Maps'' and ''Breast Stories.''

Spivak was awarded the 2012 [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]] for being "a critical theorist and educator speaking for the [[humanities]] against [[intellectual]] [[colonialism]] in relation to the [[globalized]] world."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Kyoto Prize / Laureates / Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak |url=http://www.inamori-f.or.jp/laureates/k28_c_gayatri/prf_e.html |website=Inamori Foundation |access-date=19 April 2016 |language=en |quote=A Critical Theorist and Educator Speaking for the Humanities Against Intellectual Colonialism in Relation to the Globalized World. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316234334/http://www.inamori-f.or.jp/laureates/k28_c_gayatri/prf_e.html |archive-date=16 March 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Columbia University Professor Gayatri Spivak Selected as 2012 Kyoto Prize Laureate in Arts and Philosophy|url=http://kyotoprize-us.org/columbia-university-professor-gayatri-spivak-selected-as-2012-kyoto-prize-laureate-in-arts-and-philosophy-2/|website=Kyoto Symposium Organization|publisher=Kyoto Prize USA|access-date=19 April 2016|archive-date=6 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506053413/http://kyotoprize-us.org/columbia-university-professor-gayatri-spivak-selected-as-2012-kyoto-prize-laureate-in-arts-and-philosophy-2/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Professor Gayatri Spivak Selected as 2012 Kyoto Prize Laureate in Arts and Philosophy|url=http://news.columbia.edu/content/professor-gayatri-spivak-selected-2012-kyoto-prize-laureate-arts-and-philosophy|website=Columbia News|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=19 April 2016|quote=Known as the 'Nobel of the arts,' the Kyoto Prize is an international award presented annually to individuals who have contributed significantly to the scientific, cultural and spiritual betterment of mankind in categories of advanced technology, basic sciences and arts and philosophy.|archive-date=21 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621103307/http://news.columbia.edu/content/professor-gayatri-spivak-selected-2012-kyoto-prize-laureate-arts-and-philosophy|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2013, she received the [[Padma Bhushan]], the third highest civilian award given by the [[Republic Of India|Republic of India]].<ref name=pib4>{{cite web|title=Padma Awards Announced|url=http://www.pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=91838|publisher=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)]]|date=25 January 2013|access-date=25 January 2013|archive-date=19 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119042602/http://www.pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=91838|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although associated with [[postcolonialism]], Spivak confirmed her separation from the discipline in her book ''A [[Critique]] of [[Postcolonial]] [[Reason]]'' (1999), a position she maintains in a 2021 essay titled "How the Heritage of Postcolonial Studies Thinks Colonialism Today",  published by ''[[Janus]] Unbound: Journal of Critical Studies''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spivak |first1=Gayatri Chakravorty |title=How the Heritage of Postcolonial Studies Thinks Colonialism Today |journal=Janus Unbound: Journal of Critical Studies |date=11 November 2021 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=19–29 |url=https://journals.library.mun.ca/index.php/JU/article/view/2309/1826 }}{{primary source inline|date=October 2023}}</ref>

==Life==

=== Early life ===
Spivak was born Gayatri Chakravorty in [[Calcutta]], India, to Pares Chandra and Sivani Chakravorty.<ref name="reader">{{cite book|editor1-last=Landry|editor1-first=Donna|editor2-last=MacLean|editor2-first=Gerald|title=The Spivak Reader|chapter=Reading Spivak|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415910019|pages=1–4|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCHcsaSi-sUC&pg=PT12|access-date=21 April 2016|archive-date=4 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200104025848/https://books.google.com/books?id=gCHcsaSi-sUC&pg=PT12|url-status=live}}</ref> After completing her secondary education at [[St. John's Diocesan Girls' Higher Secondary School]], Spivak attended [[Presidency College, Kolkata]] under the [[University of Calcutta]], from which she graduated in 1959.<ref name="reader" />

Spivak has been married twice—first to Talbot Spivak, from 1964 to 1977, and then to Basudev Chatterji.<ref name=":0">{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Dinitia |title=Creating a Stir Wherever She Goes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/09/arts/creating-a-stir-wherever-she-goes.html |work=The New York Times |date=9 February 2002 }}</ref> She has no children.<ref name=":0" />

=== 1960s and 1970s ===
In 1959, upon graduation, she secured employment as an English tutor for forty hours a week. Her MA [[thesis]] was on the representation of innocence in [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] with [[M.H. Abrams]]. In 1961, Spivak joined the graduate program in English at [[Cornell University]] in the United States, traveling on money borrowed on a so-called "life mortgage". In 1962, unable to secure financial aid from the department of English, she transferred to a new program called [[Comparative Literature]], although she had insufficient preparation in French and German. Her [[dissertation]] was under the guidance of the program's first director, [[Paul de Man]], titled ''Myself Must I Remake: The Life and Poetry of [[W. B. Yeats|W.B. Yeats]]''.<ref name="reader" /> In 1963–1964, she attended [[Girton College, Cambridge]], as a research student under the supervision of Professor [[Thomas Rice Henn|T.R. Henn]], writing on the representation of the stages of development of the lyric subject in the poetry of Yeats. She presented a course in the summer of 1963 on "Yeats and the Theme of Death" at the Yeats Summer School in [[Sligo|Sligo, Ireland]]. (She returned there in 1987 to present Yeats' position within post-coloniality.){{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In the Fall of 1965, Spivak became an [[assistant professor]] in the English department of the [[University of Iowa]]. She received tenure in 1970. She did not publish her [[doctoral dissertation]], "The Great Wheel: Stages in the Personality of Yeats's Lyric Speaker" (Cornell, 1967), but decided to write a critical book on Yeats that would be accessible to her undergraduate students without compromising her intellectual positions. The result was her first book, written for young adults, ''Myself Must I Remake: The Life and Poetry of W.B. Yeats''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/gayatri-chakravorty-spivak/myself-must-i-remake-the-life-and-poetry-of-w-b/|title=MYSELF MUST I REMAKE: The Life and Poetry of W.

In 1967, on her regular attempts at self-improvement, Spivak purchased a book, by an author unknown to her, entitled ''[[Of Grammatology|De la grammatologie]]''. She decided to translate this book, and wrote a long translator's preface. This publication was immediately a success, and the "Translator's Preface" began to be used around the world as an introduction to the philosophy of [[deconstruction]] launched by the author, [[Jacques Derrida]], whom Spivak met in 1971.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://conversations.e-flux.com/t/gayatri-spivak-on-derrida-the-subaltern-and-her-life-and-work/4198|title=Gayatri Spivak on Derrida, the subaltern, and her life and work|website=e-flux conversations|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09|archive-date=10 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310010714/https://conversations.e-flux.com/t/gayatri-spivak-on-derrida-the-subaltern-and-her-life-and-work/4198|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1974, at the University of Iowa, Spivak founded the MFA in Translation in the department of Comparative Literature.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.writinguniversity.org/content/writing-iowa | title=Writing at Iowa &#124; the Writing University | access-date=19 March 2016 | archive-date=17 June 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617150913/https://www.writinguniversity.org/content/writing-iowa | url-status=live }}</ref> The following year, she became the Director of the Program in Comparative Literature and was promoted to a full professorship. In 1978, she was National Humanities Professor at the [[University of Chicago]]. She received many subsequent residential [[visiting professorship]]s and fellowships. In 1978, she joined the [[University of Texas at Austin]] as professor of English and Comparative Literature.

=== 1980s to present ===
In 1982, she was appointed as the Longstreet Professor in English and Comparative Literature at [[Emory University]]. In 1986, at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], she became the first Mellon Professor of English. Here, she established the Cultural Studies program. From 1991, she was a member of faculty at [[Columbia University]] as Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities, where, in 2007, she was made University Professor in the Humanities.

Since 1986, Spivak has been engaged in teaching and training adults and children among the landless illiterates on the border of [[West Bengal]] and [[Bihar]]/[[Jharkhand]]. This sustained attempt to access the [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] damaged by the [[millennium|millennial]] oppression of the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] has allowed her to understand the situation of globality as well as the limits of high theory more clearly. In 1997, her friend Lore Metzger, a survivor of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], left her $10,000 in her will, to help with the work of rural education. With this, Spivak established the Pares Chandra and Sivani Chakravorty Memorial Foundation for Rural Education; to which she contributed the majority of her Kyoto Prize.

Spivak rose to prominence with her translation of [[Derrida]]'s ''[[Of Grammatology|De la grammatologie]]'', which included a translator's introduction that has been described as "setting a new standard for self-reflexivity in prefaces".<ref name="spivak_reader">{{cite book |title=The Spivak Reader: Selected Works of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |isbn=9780415910019 |pages=1–4 |chapter=Reading Spivak |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCHcsaSi-sUC&pg=PT12 |access-date=19 April 2016 |archive-date=4 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200104025848/https://books.google.com/books?id=gCHcsaSi-sUC&pg=PT12 |url-status=live }}</ref> After this, as a member of the "[[Subaltern Studies Collective]]", she carried out a series of historical studies and literary critiques of imperialism and international feminism. She has often referred to herself as a "practical [[Marxist]]-[[feminist]]-[[deconstruction]]ist".<ref name="thehindu">{{cite news |last=Lahiri |first=Bulan |date=6 February 2011 |title=Speaking to Spivak |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |location=Chennai, India |url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/in-conversation-speaking-to-spivak/article1159208.ece |access-date=7 February 2011 |archive-date=24 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424182808/http://www.thehindu.com/books/in-conversation-speaking-to-spivak/article1159208.ece |url-status=live }}</ref> Her predominant ethico-political concern has been for the space occupied by the subaltern, especially subaltern women, both in discursive practices and in institutions of Western cultures. [[Edward Said]] wrote of Spivak's work, "She pioneered the study in literary theory of non-Western women and produced one of the earliest and most coherent accounts of that role available to us."<ref>Dinitia Smith, [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/09/arts/creating-a-stir-wherever-she-goes.html "Creating a Stir Wherever She Goes,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501112532/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/09/arts/creating-a-stir-wherever-she-goes.html |date=1 May 2017 }} ''New York Times'' (9 February 2002) B7.</ref>

=== "Can the Subaltern Speak?" ===
Her essay, "Can the Subaltern Speak?" (1988), established Spivak among the ranks of feminists who consider history, geography, and class when thinking about women. In "Can the Subaltern Speak?", Spivak discusses the lack of an account of the [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] practice, leading her to reflect on whether the [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] can even speak.<ref name="sharp6">{{cite book

 }}</ref>  Spivak writes about the process, the focus on the Eurocentric [[Subject (philosophy)|Subject]] as they disavow the problem of representation; and by invoking the Subject of Europe, these intellectuals constitute the subaltern 'Other of Europe' as anonymous and mute. In all her work, Spivak's main effort has been to try to find ways of accessing the [[subjectivity]] of those who are being investigated. She is hailed{{By whom|date=June 2022}} as a critic who has feminized and globalized the philosophy of [[deconstruction]], considering the position of the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] (a word used by [[Antonio Gramsci]] as describing ungeneralizable fringe groups of society who lack access to citizenship).

In the early 1980s, she was also hailed as a co-founder of [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]], which she refused to accept fully. Her ''A Critique of Postcolonial Reason'', published in 1999, explores how major works of European [[metaphysics]] (e.g., [[Kant]], [[Hegel]]) not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions, but actively prevent non-Europeans from occupying positions as fully human subjects.<ref name="critique">{{cite book |last1=Spivak |first1=Gayatri Chakravorty |title=A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Toward a History of the Vanishing Present |date=1999 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-17764-2 }}{{page needed|date=October 2023}}{{primary source inline|date=October 2023}}</ref> In this work, Spivak launched the concept of "[[sanctioned ignorance]]" for the "reproducing and foreclosing of colonialist structures". This concept denotes a purposeful silencing through the "dismissing of a particular context as being irrelevant"; an institutionalized and ideological way of presenting the world.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Herbjørnsrud |first1=Dag |title=Beyond decolonizing: global intellectual history and reconstruction of a comparative method |journal=Global Intellectual History |date=3 September 2021 |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=614–640 |doi=10.1080/23801883.2019.1616310 |s2cid=166543159 }}</ref>

Spivak coined the term "[[strategic essentialism]]", which refers to a sort of temporary [[solidarity]] for the purpose of social action. For example, women's groups have many different agendas that potentially make it difficult for feminists to work together for common causes. "Strategic [[essentialism]]" allows for disparate groups to accept temporarily an "essentialist" position that enables them able to act cohesively and "can be powerfully displacing and disruptive."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fuss |first1=Diana |title=Reading Like a Feminist |journal=Differences |date=1 July 1989 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=77–92 |doi=10.1215/10407391-1-2-77 |quote=Spivak's simultaneous critique and endorsement of Subaltern Studies's essentialism suggests that humanism can be activated in the service of the subaltern; in other words, when put into practice by the dispossessed themselves, essentialism can be powerfully displacing and disruptive.}}</ref>

However, while others have built upon the idea of "[[strategic]] essentialism", Spivak has been unhappy with the ways the concept has been taken up and used. In interviews, she has disavowed the term, although she has not completely deserted the [[concept]] itself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Danius|first1=Sara|last2=Jonsson|first2=Stefan|last3=Spivak|first3=Gayatri Chakravorty|date=1993|title=An Interview with Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|jstor=303357|journal=Boundary 2|volume=20|issue=2|pages=24–50|doi=10.2307/303357}}{{primary source inline|date=October 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://literariness.org/2016/04/09/strategic-essentialism/|title=Strategic Essentialism|date=2016-04-09|work=Literary Theory and Criticism Notes|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US|archive-date=9 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309113415/https://literariness.org/2016/04/09/strategic-essentialism/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In speeches given and published since 2002, Spivak has addressed the issue of terrorism and suicide bombings. With the aim of bringing an end to suicide bombings, she has explored and "tried to imagine what message [such acts] might contain", ruminating that "suicidal resistance is a message inscribed in the body when no other means will get through".<ref name="terror">{{cite journal |last1=Spivak |first1=Gayatri Chakravorty |title=Terror: A Speech After 9-11 |journal=Boundary 2 |date=2004 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=81–111 |doi=10.1215/01903659-31-2-81 |s2cid=161187420 |id={{Project MUSE|171420}} }}{{primary source inline|date=October 2023}}</ref> One critic has suggested that this sort of stylised language may serve to blur important moral issues relating to terrorism.<ref>{{cite news |last=Alexander |first=Edward |date=10 January 2003 |title=Evil educators defend the indefensible |work=Jerusalem Post |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/276661721.html?dids=276661721:276661721&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+10%2C+2003&author=EDWARD+ALEXANDER&pub=Jerusalem+Post&edition=&startpage=09.A&desc=Evil+educators+defend+the+indefensible |access-date=6 July 2017 |archive-date=5 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005231731/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/276661721.html?dids=276661721:276661721&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+10,+2003&author=EDWARD+ALEXANDER&pub=Jerusalem+Post&edition=&startpage=09.A&desc=Evil+educators+defend+the+indefensible |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, Spivak stated in the same speech that "single coerced yet willed suicidal 'terror' is in excess of the destruction of dynastic temples and the violation of women, tenacious and powerfully residual. It has not the banality of evil. It is informed by the stupidity of belief taken to extreme."<ref name="terror" />

Apart from Derrida, Spivak has also translated the fiction of the Bengali author, [[Mahasweta Devi]], the poetry of the 18-century Bengali poet [[Ramprasad Sen]], and ''A Season in the Congo'' by [[Aimé Césaire]], a poet, essayist, and statesman from [[Martinique]]. In 1997, she received a prize for translation into English from the [[Sahitya Akademi|Sahitya Akadami]] from the National Academy of Literature in India.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak Awards |url=https://www.mla.org/content/download/71150/2133498/NL_49-4_web.pdf |access-date=25 May 2019 |archive-date=25 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525084302/https://www.mla.org/content/download/71150/2133498/NL_49-4_web.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

In a letter to the faculty, he wrote:

{{blockquote|Not only does her world-renowned scholarship—grounded in deconstructivist literary theory—range widely from critiques of post-colonial discourse to feminism, Marxism, and globalization; her lifelong search for fresh insights and understanding has transcended the traditional boundaries of discipline while retaining the fire for new knowledge that is the hallmark of a great intellect.}}

==Criticism==

{{criticism section|date=March 2022}}
Spivak has often been criticized for her cryptic prose.<ref>[http://newpartisan.squarespace.com/home/clarity-is-king-eric-adler-on-postmodernists-limpid-bursts.html Clarity Is King&nbsp;– Eric Adler on Postmodernists' Limpid Bursts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822033538/http://newpartisan.squarespace.com/home/clarity-is-king-eric-adler-on-postmodernists-limpid-bursts.html |date=22 August 2019 }}.

New Statesman. Retrieved on 22 August 2019.</ref> [[Terry Eagleton]] laments that
{{blockquote|If colonial societies endure what Spivak calls 'a series of interruptions, a repeated tearing of time that cannot be sutured', much the same is true of her own overstuffed, excessively elliptical prose. She herself, unsurprisingly, reads the book's broken-backed structure in just this way, as an iconoclastic departure from 'accepted scholarly or critical practice'. But the ellipses, the heavy-handed jargon, the cavalier assumption that you know what she means, or that if you don't she doesn't much care, are as much the overcodings of an academic coterie as a smack in the face for conventional scholarship.<ref>Terry Eagleton, "[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n10/eagl01_.html In the Gaudy Supermarket] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210174722/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n10/eagl01_.html |date=10 December 2006 }}," ''London Review of Books'' (13 May 1999).</ref>}}
Writing for the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Stephen Howe complained that "Spivak is so bewilderingly eclectic, so prone to juxtapose diverse notions without synthesis, that ascribing a coherent position to her on any question is extremely difficult."<ref name=":0" />

Judith Butler, in a response critical of Eagleton's position, cited Adorno's comment on the lesser value of the work of theorists who "recirculate received opinion", and opined that Spivak "gives us the political landscape of culture in its obscurity and proximity", and that Spivak's supposedly "complex" language has resonated with and profoundly changed the thinking of "tens of thousands of activists and scholars", and continues to do so.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n13/letters.html|journal=London Review of Books|volume=21|issue=13|date=1 July 1999|title=letters|access-date=24 April 2006|archive-date=8 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008113559/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n13/letters.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2024, Spivak was involved in a controversy where she repeatedly corrected the pronunciation of a dalit graduate student Anshul Kumar who asked her a question as part of a discussion at an event in [[Jawaharlal Nehru University|Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi]]. Anshul Kumar shared in a dalit blog about feeling humiliated and insulted during the incident.<ref>{{Cite web |last=rti_admin |date=2024-05-28 |title=Can Spivak listen?

== Avital Ronell controversy ==
In May 2018, Spivak signed a collective letter to [[New York University]] to defend [[Avital Ronell]], a colleague of Spivak, against the charge of sexual abuse from NYU graduate student Nimrod Reitman. Spivak and the other signatories called the case a "legal nightmare" for Ronell and charged Reitman with conducting a "malicious campaign" against her. More specifically, the letter suggested that Ronell should be excused on the basis of the significance of her academic contributions. Many signatories were also concerned of the utilisation of feminist tools, like [[Title IX]], to take down feminists.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/nyregion/sexual-harassment-nyu-female-professor.html | title=What Happens to #MeToo when a Feminist is the Accused? | work=The New York Times | date=13 August 2018 | last1=Greenberg | first1=Zoe }}</ref> [[Judith Butler]], the chief signatory, subsequently apologized for certain aspects of the letter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jezebel.com/what-are-we-to-make-of-the-case-of-scholar-avital-ronel-1828366966|title=What Are We to Make of the Case of Scholar Avital Ronell?|first=Esther|last=Wang|website=Jezebel|date=17 August 2018 |access-date=31 August 2018|archive-date=31 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831042146/https://jezebel.com/what-are-we-to-make-of-the-case-of-scholar-avital-ronel-1828366966|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/letters/judith-butler-explains-letter-in-support-of-avital-ronell/|title=Judith Butler Explains Letter in Support of Avital Ronell|date=20 August 2018|access-date=31 August 2018|archive-date=30 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830140614/https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/letters/judith-butler-explains-letter-in-support-of-avital-ronell/|url-status=live}}</ref> NYU ultimately found Ronell guilty of sexual harassment and suspended her for a year.
