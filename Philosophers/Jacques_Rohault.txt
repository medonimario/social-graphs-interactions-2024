==Life==
Rohault was born in [[Amiens]], the son of a wealthy wine merchant, and educated in [[Paris]]. Having grown up with the conventional scholastic philosophy of his day, he adopted and popularised the new [[Cartesian physics]]. His Wednesday lectures in Paris became celebrated; they began in the 1650s, and attracted in particular [[Pierre-Sylvain Régis]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Tad M.

Rohault died on December 27, 1672, in Paris.

Rohault held to the [[mechanical philosophy]], and gave qualified support to its "corpuscular" or atomic form of explanation, assuming that "small figured bodies" were the underlying physical reality. His ''Traité de physique'' (Paris, 1671) became a standard textbook for half a century.<ref name="Applebaum2000">{{cite book|author=Wilbur Applebaum|title=Encyclopedia of the Scientific Revolution: From Copernicus to Newton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k43Q9RHuGXgC&pg=PT796|access-date=29 May 2013|date=13 June 2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-58255-5|page=796}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Richard A.
