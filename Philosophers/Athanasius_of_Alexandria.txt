His intermittent episcopacy spanned 45 years ({{c.|lk=no|8 June 328}} – 2 May 373), of which over 17 encompassed five exiles, when he was replaced on the order of four different [[Roman emperor]]s. Athanasius was a [[Church Father]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Laos|first=Nicolas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Os2DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA217|title=Methexiology: Philosophical Theology and Theological Philosophy for the Deification of Humanity|year=2016|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-4982-3385-9|page=217|language=en}}</ref> the chief [[Tomus ad Antiochenos|proponent]] of [[Trinity|Trinitarianism]] against [[Arianism]], and a noted [[Roman Egypt|Egyptian]] Christian leader of the fourth century.

Conflict with [[Arius]] and Arianism, as well as with successive Roman emperors, shaped Athanasius' career. In 325, at age 27, Athanasius began his leading role against the Arians as a deacon and assistant to Bishop [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]] during the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] had convened the council in May–August 325 to address the Arian position that the [[Son of God]], [[Jesus of Nazareth]], is of a distinct substance from the [[God in Christianity|Father]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/First-Council-of-Nicaea-325 |title=First Council of Nicaea |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> Three years after that council, Athanasius succeeded his mentor as Patriarch of Alexandria. In addition to the conflict with the Arians (including powerful and influential Arian churchmen led by [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]]), he struggled against the Emperors Constantine, [[Constantius II]], [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] and [[Valens]]. He was known as '''''Athanasius Contra Mundum''''' (Latin for 'Athanasius Against the World').

Nonetheless, within a few years of his death, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] called him the "Pillar of the Church". His writings were well regarded by subsequent Church fathers in the West and the East, who noted their devotion to the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word-become-man]], pastoral concern and interest in [[monasticism]].

== Biography ==
[[File:2896 - Catania - Cattedrale - G. Nicoli - S. Atanasio, nella ''Floretta'' (giardino) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 4-July-2008.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of Athanasius in [[Catania]], [[Sicily]]|alt=]]

Athanasius was born to a Christian family in [[Alexandria]],<ref name="oca">{{Cite web|url=http://oca.org/saints/lives/2014/05/02/101269-st-athanasius-the-great-the-patriarch-of-alexandria|title=St. Athanasius the Great the Patriarch of Alexandria|website=oca.org|language=en|access-date=14 March 2018}}</ref> or possibly the nearby [[Nile Delta]] town of [[Damanhur]], sometime between 293 and 298. The earlier date is sometimes assigned because of the maturity revealed in his two earliest treatises ''Contra Gentes'' (''Against the Heathens'') and ''De Incarnatione'' (''On the Incarnation''), which were likely written circa 318 before Arianism had begun to make itself felt, as those writings do not show an awareness of Arianism.<ref name="Clifford1907"/>

However, Cornelius Clifford places his birth no earlier than 296 and no later than 298, based on the fact that Athanasius indicates no first-hand recollection of the [[Diocletianic Persecution|Maximian persecution]] of 303, which he suggests Athanasius would have remembered if he had been ten years old at the time. Secondly, the ''Festal Epistles'' state that the Arians had accused Athanasius, among other charges, of not having yet attained the canonical age (35) and thus could not have been properly ordained as patriarch of Alexandria in 328. The accusation must have seemed plausible.<ref name="Clifford1907"/> The Orthodox Church places his year of birth around 297.<ref name=oca/>

=== Education ===
His parents were wealthy enough to give him a fine secular education.<ref name="Clifford1907">{{Catholic |last=Clifford |first=Cornelius |wstitle=St. Athanasius |volume=2 |inline=1 |prescript=}}</ref> He was, nevertheless, clearly not a member of the Egyptian aristocracy.<ref name="Barnes 2001">{{cite book | title=Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Barnes, Timothy David | year=2001 | url=https://archive.org/details/TimothyD.BarnesAthanasiusAndConstantius1993HarvardUniversity | page=[https://archive.org/details/TimothyD.BarnesAthanasiusAndConstantius1993HarvardUniversity/page/n34 13]}}</ref> Some Western scholars consider his command of [[Greek language|Greek]], in which he wrote most (if not all) of his surviving works, evidence that he may have been a [[Greeks|Greek]] born in [[Alexandria]]. Historical evidence, however, indicates that he was fluent in [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as well, given the regions of Egypt where he preached.<ref name="Barnes 2001"/> Some surviving copies of his writings are in fact in Coptic, though scholars differ as to whether he wrote them in Coptic originally (which would make him the first patriarch to do so) or whether these were translations of writings originally in Greek.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/><ref name="Barnes 2001"/>

[[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] relates a story that as Bishop [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander]] stood by a window, he watched boys playing on the seashore below, imitating the ritual of Christian baptism. He sent for the children and discovered that one of the boys (Athanasius) had acted as bishop. After questioning Athanasius, Bishop Alexander informed him that the baptisms were genuine, as both the [[Sacramental matter and form|form and matter of the sacrament]] had been performed through the recitation of the correct words and the administration of water, and that he must not continue to do this as those baptized had not been properly [[Catechesis|catechized]]. He invited Athanasius and his playfellows to prepare for clerical careers.<ref name="Clifford1930"/>

Alexandria was the most important trade centre in the empire during Athanasius's boyhood. Intellectually, morally, and politically—it epitomized the ethnically diverse Graeco-Roman world, even more than Rome or Constantinople, Antioch or Marseilles.<ref name="Clifford1930">Clifford, Cornelius, ''Catholic Encyclopedia 1930'', Volume 2, pp. 35–40 "Athanasius".</ref> Its famous catechetical school, while sacrificing none of its famous passion for orthodoxy since the days of [[Pantaenus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionysius]] and [[Theognostus of Alexandria|Theognostus]], had begun to take on an almost secular character in the comprehensiveness of its interests and had counted influential pagans among its serious auditors.<ref>[[Eusebius]], Hist. Eccl., VI, xix</ref>

[[Peter I of Alexandria|Peter of Alexandria]], the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of the [[Diocletianic Persecution|Great Persecution]] and may have been one of Athanasius's teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria was [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]]. According to [[Sozomen]]; "the Bishop Alexander 'invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen' ".(Soz., II, xvii)<ref name="Clifford1907"/>

Athanasius' earliest work, ''Against the Heathen – On the Incarnation'' (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought but in an orthodox way.<ref name="Clifford1907"/> Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools and in particular with the developments of [[neoplatonism]]. Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria|School of Alexandria]] away from the Origenist principles such as the "entirely allegorical interpretation of the text". Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes [[Homer]] more than once (''Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29'').

[[File:Athanasius Frederikskirken.JPG|thumb|upright|''St. Athanasius'' (1883–84), by [[Carl Rohl-Smith]], [[Frederik's Church]], [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]|alt=]]
Athanasius knew Greek and admitted not knowing [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [see, e.g., the 39th Festal Letter of St. Athan]. The Old Testament passages he quotes frequently come from the [[Septuagint]] Greek translation. Only rarely did he use other Greek versions (to [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]] once in the ''Ecthesis'', to other versions once or twice on the Psalms), and his knowledge of the Old Testament was limited to the Septuagint.<ref name="GK">Ἀλεξανδρεὺς τῷ γένει, ἀνὴρ λόγιος, δυνατὸς ὢν ἐν ταῖς γραφαῖς</ref>{{full citation needed|date=May 2021}} 

Bishop (or Patriarch, the highest ecclesial rank in the Centre of the Church, in Alexandria) Alexander ordained Athanasius a deacon in 319.<ref name="EA">''Encyclopedia Americana'', vol. 2 [[Danbury, Connecticut]]: Grolier Incorporated, 1997. {{ISBN|0-7172-0129-5}}.{{page needed|date=May 2022}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2021}} In 325, Athanasius served as Alexander's secretary at the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. Already a recognized theologian and [[Asceticism|ascetic]], he was the obvious choice to replace his ageing mentor Alexander as the [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria]],<ref name="EB">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Athanasius |title=Saint Athanasius |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |first=Edward R. |last=Hardy}}</ref> despite the opposition of the followers of [[Arius]] and [[Melitius of Lycopolis|Meletius of Lycopolis]].<ref name="EA"/>

At length, in the Council of Nicaea, the term "consubstantial" ([[homoousion]]) was adopted, and a formulary of faith embodying it was drawn up by [[Hosius of Corduba|Hosius of Córdoba]]. From this time to the end of the Arian controversies, the word "consubstantial" continued to be the test of orthodoxy. The formulary of faith drawn up by Hosius is known as the [[Nicene Creed]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/>{{rp|232}} However, "he was not the originator of the famous 'homoousion' (<small>[[Accusative case|ACC]]</small> of ''homoousios''). The term had been proposed in a non-obvious and illegitimate sense by [[Paul of Samosata]] to the Fathers at Antioch, and had been rejected by them as savouring of materialistic conceptions of the Godhead."<ref name="Clifford1907"/>

While still a deacon under Alexander's care (or early in his patriarchate as discussed below) Athanasius may have also become acquainted with some of the solitaries of the Egyptian desert, and in particular [[Anthony the Great]], whose life he is said to have written.<ref name="Clifford1930"/>

=== Opposition to Arianism ===
{{Further|Arian controversy}}
In about 319, when Athanasius was a deacon, a [[presbyter]] named Arius came into a direct conflict with Alexander of Alexandria. It appears that Arius reproached Alexander for what he felt were misguided or heretical teachings being taught by the bishop.<ref>Kannengiesser, Charles, "Alexander and Arius of Alexandria: The last Ante-Nicene theologians", Miscelanea En Homenaje Al P. Antonio Orbe Compostellanum Vol. XXXV, no. 1–2. (Santiago de Compostela, 1990), 398</ref> Arius embraced a subordinationist [[Christology]] which taught that Christ was the divine Son ([[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]) of God, made, not begotten. Arius had support from a powerful bishop named [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]] (not to be confused with [[Eusebius]] of Caesarea),<ref>Alexander of Alexandria's Catholic Epistle</ref> illustrating how Arius's subordinationist Christology was shared by other Christians in the empire. Arius was subsequently excommunicated by Alexander, and Arius began to elicit the support of many bishops who agreed with his position.<ref name="EA" />{{rp|297}}

Frances A. M. Forbes writes that when Patriarch Alexander was on his death-bed he called Athanasius, who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made bishop. "When the Bishops of the Church assembled to elect their new Patriarch, the whole Catholic population surrounded the church, holding up their hands to Heaven and crying; "Give us Athanasius!" The Bishops had nothing better. Athanasius was thus elected, as Gregory tells us..."

In consequence of his recommendation, the bishops of all Egypt assembled at Alexandria, and finding the people and clergy unanimous in their choice of Athanasius for patriarch, they confirmed the election about the middle of year 326. He seems, then, to have been about thirty years of age."<ref name="Butler1860" />

T. Gilmartin (Professor of History, [[Maynooth]], 1890) writes: "On the death of Alexander, five months after the termination of the Council of Nicaea, Athanasius was unanimously elected to fill the vacant see. He was most unwilling to accept the dignity, for he clearly foresaw the difficulties in which it would involve him. The clergy and people were determined to have him as their bishop, Patriarch of Alexandria, and refused to accept any excuses. He at length consented to accept a responsibility that he sought in vain to escape, and was consecrated in 326, when he was about thirty years of age."<ref name="ReferenceB">T. Gilmartin, ''Manual of Church History'', Vol. 1. Ch XVII, 1890.</ref>{{rp|244–248}}

Athanasius' episcopate began on 9 May 328 as the [[Councils of Alexandria|Alexandrian Council]] elected Athanasius to succeed after the death of Alexander.<ref name="ReferenceB" />{{rp|245}} Patriarch Athanasius spent over 17 years in five exiles ordered by four different Roman Emperors, not counting approximately six more incidents in which Athanasius fled Alexandria to escape people seeking to take his life.<ref name="EB"/> During his first years as bishop, Athanasius visited the churches of his territory, which at that time included all of [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Libya in the Roman era|Libya]]. He established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including [[Pachomius the Great|Pachomius]], which proved very valuable to him over the years.<ref name="EB" />

"During the forty-eight years of his episcopate, his history is told in the history of the controversies in which he was constantly engaged with the Arians, and of the sufferings he had to endure in defence of the Nicene faith. 
We have seen that when Arius was allowed to return from exile in 328, Athanasius refused to remove the sentence of excommunication."<ref name="ReferenceB" />{{Rp|page=245}}

====First exile====
Athanasius' first problem lay with Meletius of Lycopolis and his followers, who had failed to abide by the First Council of Nicaea. That council also [[anathema]]tized Arius. Accused of mistreating Arians and Meletians, Athanasius answered those charges at a gathering of bishops at the [[First Synod of Tyre]] in 335. There, Eusebius of Nicomedia and other supporters of Arius deposed Athanasius.<ref name="EA"/>{{page needed|date=May 2022}} On 6 November, both sides of the dispute met with Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] in [[Constantinople]].<ref>Barnes, Timothy D., ''Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1993), 23</ref> At that meeting, the Arians claimed Athanasius would try to cut off essential Egyptian grain supplies to Constantinople. He was found guilty and sent into exile to Augusta Treverorum in Gaul (now [[Trier]] in Germany).<ref name="EA"/>{{page needed|date=May 2022}}<ref name="EB"/><ref name="Christianity, Daily Telegraph 1999">Christianity, ''Daily Telegraph'' 1999{{full citation needed|date=May 2022}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=May 2022}}

When Athanasius reached his destination in exile in 336, [[Maximin of Trier]] received him, but not as a disgraced person. Athanasius stayed with him for two years.<ref name="Butler1860">{{Cite book |last=Butler |first=Alban |url=https://archive.org/details/livesofsaintswit00butl/page/164/mode/2up |title=Lives of the Saints |date=1894 |publisher= Benziger Bros., Inc. |pages=164–165}}</ref> Constantine died in 337 and was succeeded by his three sons, [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], [[Constantius II|Constantius]], and [[Constans]].

====Second exile====

[[File:Athanasius of Alexandria.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of the saint in St Athanasius's [[Catholic Church]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]]|alt=]]

When Emperor Constantine I died, Athanasius was allowed to return to his [[Episcopal see|See]] of Alexandria. Shortly thereafter, however, Constantius II renewed the order for Athanasius's banishment in 338. "Within a few weeks he set out for Rome to lay his case before the Church at large. He had made his appeal to [[Pope Julius I|Pope Julius]], who took up his cause with whole-heartedness that never wavered down to the day of that holy pontiff's death. The pope summoned a synod of bishops to meet in Rome. After a careful and detailed examination of the entire case, the primate's innocence was proclaimed to the Christian world."<ref name="Clifford1907"/> During this time, [[Gregory of Cappadocia]], an Arian bishop, was installed as the patriarch of Alexandria, usurping the absent Athanasius. Athanasius did, however, remain in contact with his people through his annual ''Festal Letters'', in which he also announced on which date [[Easter]] would be celebrated that year.<ref name="EB"/>

In 339 or 340, nearly one hundred bishops met at Alexandria, declared in favour of Athanasius,<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_VJAwAAQBAJ&q=339+or+340&pg=RA1-PA47 | title=A History of the Councils of the Church: from the Original Documents, to the close of the Second Council of Nicaea A.D. 787 | publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers | author=Clark, William R. | year=2007 | page=47 | isbn=9781556352478}}</ref> and vigorously rejected the criticisms of the Eusebian faction at Tyre. Plus, Pope Julius wrote to the supporters of Arius strongly urging Athanasius's reinstatement, but that effort proved in vain. Julius called a [[synod]] in Rome in 340 to address the matter, which proclaimed Athanasius the rightful bishop of Alexandria.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMhzlnY0P0QC&q=340+Julius+called&pg=PA82 | title=The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325–787): Their History and Theology | publisher=Liturgical Press | author=Davis, Leo Donald | year=1983 | page=82| isbn=9780814656167 }}</ref>

Early in 343 Athanasius met with Hosius of Córdoba, and together they set out for [[Sofia|Serdica]]. A full council of the Church was summoned there in deference to the Roman pontiff's wishes. At this great gathering of prelates, leaders of the Church, the case of Athanasius was taken up once more, that is, Athanasius was formally questioned over misdemeanours and even murder, (a bishop in Egypt named Arsenius had turned up missing, and they blamed his death on Athanasius, even supposedly producing Arsenius' severed hand.)<ref>{{Cite book |last=Milman |first=Henry Hart |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OYAZAAAAYAAJ&dq=athanasius+Arsenius+severed+hand&pg=PA382 |title=The History of Christianity, from the Birth of Christ to the Abolition of Paganism in the Roman Empire |date=1881 |publisher=T. Y. Crowell |pages=382 |language=en}}</ref>

The council was convoked for the purpose of inquiring into the charges against Athanasius and other bishops, on account of which they were deposed from their sees by the semi-Arian Synod of Antioch in 341 and went into exile. Eusebian bishops objected to the admission of Athanasius and other deposed bishops to the council, except as accused persons to answer the charges brought against them. Their objections were overridden by the orthodox bishops. The Eusebians, seeing they had no chance of having their views carried, retired to [[Philippopolis (Thrace)|Philippopolis]] in Thrace where they held an opposition council under the presidency of the Patriarch of Antioch and confirmed the decrees of the [[Synods of Antioch|Synod of Antioch]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/>{{Rp|pages=233–234}}

Athanasius' innocence was reaffirmed at the [[Council of Serdica]]. Two conciliar letters were prepared, one to the clergy and faithful of Alexandria, the other to the bishops of Egypt and Libya, in which the will of the council was made known. Meanwhile, the Eusebians issued an anathema against Athanasius and his supporters. The persecution against the orthodox party broke out with renewed vigour, and Constantius was induced to prepare drastic measures against Athanasius and the priests who were devoted to him. Orders were given that if Athanasius attempted to re-enter his see, he should be put to death. Athanasius, accordingly, withdrew from Serdica to [[Niš|Naissus]] in [[Mysia]], where he celebrated the Easter festival of the year 344.<ref name="Clifford1907"/> Hosius presided over the Council of Serdica, as he did for the First Council of Nicaea, which like the 341 synod found Athanasius innocent.<ref name="EB1878">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/a/athanasius|title=St. Athanasius – Christian Classics Ethereal Library |website=www.ccel.org|language=en|access-date=14 March 2018}}</ref> He celebrated his last Easter in exile in [[Aquileia]] in April 345, received by Bishop [[Fortunatianus of Aquileia|Fortunatianus]].<ref>Barnes, Timothy David, ''Athanasius and Constantius'', Harvard 2001, p. 66</ref>

The Council of Serdica sent an emissary to report their finding to Constantius. Constantius reconsidered his decision, owing to a threatening letter from his brother Constans and the uncertain conditions of affairs on the Persian border, and he accordingly made up his mind to yield. But three separate letters were needed to overcome the natural hesitation of Athanasius. When he finally acquiesced to meet with Constantius, he was accorded a gracious interview by the emperor and sent back to his see in triumph and began ten years of peace.<ref name="Clifford1907"/>

Pope Julius died in April 352 and was succeeded by [[Pope Liberius|Liberius]]. For two years Liberius had been favourable to the cause of Athanasius; but driven at last into exile, he was induced to sign an ambiguous formula, from which the great Nicene text, the "homoousion", had been studiously omitted. In 355 a [[Synod of Milan|council was held at Milan]], where in spite of the vigorous opposition of a handful of loyal prelates among the Western bishops, a fourth condemnation of Athanasius was announced to the world. With his friends scattered, Hosius in exile, and Pope Liberius denounced as acquiescing in Arian formularies, Athanasius could hardly hope to escape. On the night of 8 February 356, while engaged in services in the Church of St. Thomas, a band of armed men burst in to secure his arrest. It was the beginning of his third exile.<ref name="Clifford1907"/>

Gilmartin writes: "By Constantius' order, the sole ruler of The Roman Empire at the death of his brother Constans, the [[Synod of Arles|Council of Arles in 353]], was held, which was presided over by Vincent, Bishop of [[Capua]], in the name of Pope Liberius. The fathers terrified of the threats of the Emperor, an avowed Arian, they consented to the condemnation of Athanasius. The Pope refused to accept their decision, and requested the Emperor to hold another Council, in which the charges against Athanasius could be freely investigated. To this Constantius consented, for he felt able to control the Council in Milan."<ref name="ReferenceB"/>{{rp|234}}

In 355, three hundred bishops assembled in Milan, most from the West and only a few from the East. They met in the Church of Milan. Shortly, the emperor ordered them to a hall in the Imperial Palace, thus ending any free debate. He presented an Arian formula of faith for their acceptance. He threatened any who refused with exile and death. All, with the exception of [[Dionysius (bishop of Milan)]], and the two Papal Legates, viz., [[Eusebius of Vercelli]] and [[Lucifer of Cagliari]], consented to the [[Arian creeds|Arian Creed]] and the condemnation of Athanasius. Those who refused were sent into exile. The decrees were forwarded to the pope for approval but were rejected because of the violence to which the bishops were subjected.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>{{rp|235}}

====Third exile====
[[File:Saint Athanasius.jpg|thumb|Athanasius at the Council of Nicea, [[William of Tyre]] manuscripts|alt=]]
Through the influence of the Eusebian faction at Constantinople, an Arian bishop, [[George of Cappadocia]], was appointed to rule the see of Alexandria in 356. Athanasius, after remaining some days in the neighbourhood of the city, finally withdrew into the desert of [[Upper Egypt]] where he remained for a period of six years, living the life of the monks and devoting himself to the composition of a group of writings, such as his ''Letter to the Monks'' and ''Four Orations against the Arians''.<ref name="Clifford1907"/> He also defended his own recent conduct in the ''Apology to Constantius'' and ''Apology for His Flight''. Constantius' persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the Arian bishop [[George of Laodicea]], prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional ''History of the Arians'', in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the [[Antichrist]].<ref name="EB" />

<!-- This section has nothing to do with subject...
Constantius ordered Liberius into exile in 356, giving him three days to comply. He was ordered into banishment to [[Stara Zagora|Beroea]], Thrace. Constantius sent expensive presents if he were to accept the Arian position, which Liberius refused. He sent him five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" which Liberius refused, saying he might bestow them on his flatterers; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where in a conference recorded by Theodore, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Serdica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment.<ref name="ReferenceB" />{{rp|235–236}}

Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at [[Sirmium]]. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the [[Nicene Creed|Creed of Niceae]], as Theodoret testifies. ([[Theodoret]], Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.).<ref name="Butler1860" /> The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed.<ref name="Christianity, Daily Telegraph 1999"/> Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>{{rp|236}}

T. Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII:
<blockquote>The Arians sought the approval of an Ecumenical Council. They sought to hold two councils. Constantius, summoned the bishops of the East to meet at [[Seleucia in Isauria]], and those of the West to [[Rimini]] in Italy. A preliminary conference was held by the Arians at [[Sirmium]], to agree a formula of faith. A "Homoeon" creed was adopted, declaring The Son to be "like the Father". The two met in autumn of 359. At Seleucia, one hundred and fifty bishops, of which one hundred and five were semi-Arian. The semi-Arians refused to accept anything less than the "Homoiousion", (see: [[Homoiousian]]), formulary of faith. The Imperial Prefect was obliged to disband, without agreeing on any creed.<ref name="ReferenceB"/></blockquote>

Acacius, the leader of the "Homoean" party went to Constantinople, where the Sirmian formulary of faith was approved by the "Home Synod", (consisted of those bishops who happened to be present at the Court for the time), and a decree of deposition issued against the leaders of the semi-Arians. At Rimini were over four hundred of which eighty were Arian, the rest were orthodox. The orthodox fathers refused to accept any creed but the Nicene, while the others were equally in favour of the Sirmian. Each party sent a deputation to the Emperor to say there was no probability to agreement, and asked for the bishops to return to their dioceses. For the purpose of wearing-down the orthodox bishops; (Sulpitius Severius says), Constantius delayed his answer for several months, and finally prevailed on them to accept the Sirmian creed. It was after this Council that [[Jerome]] said: " ...the whole world groaned in astonishment to find itself Arian."<ref name="ReferenceB"/>{{rp|239}}

The Arians no longer presented an unbroken front to their orthodox opponents.-->Constantius died on 4 November 361 and was succeeded by [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]. The proclamation of the new prince's accession was the signal for a pagan outbreak against the still dominant Arian faction in Alexandria. George, the usurping bishop, was imprisoned and murdered. An obscure presbyter named Pistus was chosen by the Arians to succeed him, when news arrived that filled the orthodox party with hope. An edict had been put forth by Julian permitting the exiled bishops of the "Galileans" to return to their "towns and provinces". Athanasius accordingly returned to Alexandria on 22 February 362.<ref name="Clifford1907"/>

In 362 Athanasius convened a council at Alexandria and presided over it with [[Eusebius of Vercelli]]. Athanasius appealed for unity among all those who had faith in Christianity, even if they differed on matters of terminology. This prepared the groundwork for his definition of the orthodox doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. However, the council also was directed against those who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit, the human soul of Christ, and Christ's divinity. Mild measures were agreed on for those heretic bishops who repented, but severe penance was decreed for the chief leaders of the major heresies.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Councils of Alexandria}}</ref>

With characteristic energy he set to work to re-establish the somewhat shattered fortunes of the orthodox party and to purge the theological atmosphere of uncertainty. To clear up the misunderstandings that had arisen in the course of the previous years, an attempt was made to determine still further the significance of the Nicene formularies. In the meanwhile, Julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Athanasius was exercising at Alexandria, addressed an order to Ecdicius, the Prefect of Egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate on the ground that he had not been included in the imperial act of clemency. The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico, who, though described in the "Chronicon Athanasianum" (XXXV) as a "philosopher", seems to have behaved with brutal insolence. On 23 October the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor's decree; but Athanasius urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration.<ref name="Clifford1907"/>

====Fourth exile====

In 362 Julian, noted for his opposition to Christianity, ordered Athanasius to leave Alexandria once again. Athanasius left for Upper Egypt, remaining there with the [[Desert Fathers]] until Julian's death on 26 June 363. Athanasius returned in secret to Alexandria, where he received a document from the new emperor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], reinstating him once more in his episcopal functions. 
His first act was to convene a council which reaffirmed the terms of the Nicene Creed. Early in September 363 he set out for [[Antioch on the Orontes]], bearing a synodal letter, in which the pronouncements of this council had been embodied. At Antioch he had an interview with Jovian, who received him graciously and even asked him to prepare an exposition of the orthodox faith. In February 364 Jovian died.<ref name="Clifford1907"/>

====Fifth exile====

The accession of Emperor [[Valens]] gave a fresh lease of life to the Arian party. He issued a decree banishing the bishops who had been deposed by Constantius but who had been permitted by Jovian to return to their sees. The news created the greatest consternation in Alexandria, and the prefect, in order to prevent a serious outbreak, gave public assurance that the very special case of Athanasius would be laid before the emperor. But Athanasius seems to have divined what was preparing in secret against him. He quietly withdrew from Alexandria in October 364 and took up his abode in a country house outside the city. Valens, who seems to have sincerely dreaded the possible consequences of another popular outbreak, within a few weeks issued orders allowing Athanasius to return to his [[episcopal see]].<ref name="EB"/> Some early reports state that Athanasius spent this period of exile at his family's ancestral tomb<ref name="EA"/> in a Christian cemetery.

====Final years and death====
After returning to Alexandria, Athanasius spent his final years repairing all the damage done during the earlier years of violence, dissent, and exile. He resumed writing and preaching undisturbed, and characteristically re-emphasized the view of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] which had been defined at Nicaea. On 2 May 373, having consecrated [[Pope Peter II of Alexandria|Peter II]], one of his presbyters as his successor, Athanasius died peacefully in his own bed, surrounded by his clergy and faithful supporters.<ref name="Clifford1930" />

== Works ==
In [[Coptic literature]], Athanasius is the first patriarch of Alexandria to use [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as well as Greek in his writings.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Coptic literature |url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026215/Coptic-literature |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=9 May 2017}}</ref>

=== Polemical and theological works ===
Athanasius was not a speculative theologian. As he states in his ''First Letters to [[Serapion of Nitria|Serapion]]'', he held on to "the tradition, teaching, and faith proclaimed by the apostles and guarded by the fathers."<ref name="EA"/> He held that both the Son of God and the Holy Spirit are [[consubstantiality|consubstantial]] with the Father, which had a great deal of influence in the development of later doctrines regarding the Trinity.<ref name="EA"/> Athanasius' ''"Letter Concerning the Decrees of the Council of Nicaea"'' (''De Decretis''), is an important historical as well as theological account of the proceedings of that council.

Examples of Athanasius' polemical writings against his theological opponents include ''Orations Against the Arians'', his defence of the divinity of the Holy Spirit (''Letters to Serapion'' in the 360s, and ''On the Holy Spirit''), against [[Pneumatomachi|Macedonianism]] and ''On the Incarnation''.<ref name="EB" /> Athanasius also authored a two-part work, ''Against the Heathen'' and ''The Incarnation of the Word of God''. Completed probably early in his life, before the Arian controversy,<ref>Justo L. Gonzalez in ''A History of Christian Thought'' notes (p. 292) that E. Schwartz places this work later, around 335, but "his arguments have not been generally accepted". The introduction to the CSMV translation of ''On the Incarnation'' places the work in 318, around the time Athanasius was ordained to the diaconate (''St Athanasius On the Incarnation'', Mowbray, England 1953)</ref> they constitute the first classic work of developed Orthodox theology. In the first part, Athanasius attacks several pagan practices and beliefs. The second part presents teachings on the redemption.<ref name="EA" /> Also in these books, Athanasius put forward the belief, referencing {{bibleref2|John|1:1–4}}, that the Son of God, the eternal Word (Logos) through whom God created the world, entered that world in human form to lead men back into the harmony from which they had earlier fallen away.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Church Fathers: On the Incarnation of the Word (Athanasius)|url=https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2802.htm|access-date=8 July 2021|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref>

His other important works include his ''Letters to Serapion'', which defends the [[divinity]] of the Holy Spirit. In a letter to Epictetus of Corinth, Athanasius anticipates future controversies in his defence of the humanity of Christ. In a letter addressed to the monk Dracontius, Athanasius urges him to leave the desert for the more active duties of a bishop.<ref name="EB" /> Athanasius also wrote several works of [[Biblical criticism|Biblical exegesis]], primarily on [[Old Testament]] materials. The most important of these is his ''Epistle to Marcellinus'' (PG 27:12–45) on how to incorporate psalm-saying into one's spiritual practice. 

Perhaps his most notable letter was his Festal Letter, written to his Church in Alexandria when he was in exile, as he could not be in their presence. This letter clearly shows his stand that accepting Jesus as the Divine Son of God is not optional but necessary: {{blockquote|I know moreover that not only this thing saddens you, but also the fact that while others have obtained the churches by violence, you are meanwhile cast out from your places. For they hold the places, but you the Apostolic Faith. They are, it is true, in the places, but outside of the true Faith; while you are outside the places indeed, but the Faith, within you. Let us consider whether is the greater, the place or the Faith. Clearly the true Faith. Who then has lost more, or who possesses more? He who holds the place, or he who holds the Faith?<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-92.htm| title = fragment conjectured to belong to a festal letter}}</ref>}}

=== Biographical and ascetic works ===

=== Misattributed works ===
{{see also|Apocalypse of Pseudo-Athanasius}}
There are several other works ascribed to him, although not necessarily generally accepted as being his own. These include the so-called [[Athanasian Creed]] (which is today generally seen as being of 5th-century Galician origin), and a complete ''Expositions on the Psalms''.<ref name="EA"/>

==Eschatology==
Based on his understanding of the prophecies of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and the [[Book of Revelation]], Athanasius described Jesus’ [[Second Coming]] in the clouds of heaven and pleads with his readers to be ready for that day, at which time Jesus would [[Last Judgment|judge the earth]], [[Universal resurrection|raise the dead]], cast out the wicked, and [[Millennialism|establish his kingdom]]. Athanasius also argued that the date of Jesus’ earthly sojourn was divinely foretold beyond refutation by the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks|seventy weeks prophecy]] of Daniel 9.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=393}}

== Veneration ==
Athanasius was originally buried in Alexandria, but his remains were later transferred to the [[San Zaccaria, Venice|Chiesa di San Zaccaria]] in [[Venice]], Italy. During [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Pope Shenouda III]]'s visit to Rome (4–10 May 1973), [[Pope Paul VI]] gave the Coptic Patriarch a [[relic]] of Athanasius,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metroplit-bishoy.org/files/Dialogues/Catholics/ICTD.doc |title=Metropolitan Bishoy of Damiette |access-date=25 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220124827/http://metroplit-bishoy.org/files/Dialogues/Catholics/ICTD.doc |archive-date=20 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which he brought back to Egypt on 15 May.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avarewase.org/en/map/athanas.htm |title=Saint Athanasius |publisher=Avarewase.org |access-date=25 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625064046/http://www.avarewase.org/en/map/athanas.htm |archive-date=25 June 2013 |url-status=dead  }}{{self-published source|date=May 2022}}</ref>{{self-published source|date=May 2022}} The relic is currently preserved under the new [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral]] in [[Cairo]].

All major Christian denominations which officially recognize saints venerate Athanasius. Western Christians observe his [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] on 2 May, the anniversary of his death. The [[Catholic Church]] considers Athanasius a [[Doctor of the Church]].<ref name="Doctors" /> For Coptic Christians, his feast day is Pashons 7 (now circa 15 May).

Historian Cornelius Clifford says in his account: "Athanasius was the greatest champion of Catholic belief on the subject of the Incarnation that the Church has ever known and in his lifetime earned the characteristic title of 'Father of Orthodoxy', by which he has been distinguished ever since."<ref name="Clifford1907"/> Clifford also says: "His career almost personifies a crisis in the history of Christianity; and he may be said rather to have shaped the events in which he took part than to have been shaped by them."<ref name="Clifford1907" /> St. [[John Henry Newman]] describes him as a "principal instrument, after the Apostles, by which the sacred truths of Christianity have been conveyed and secured to the world".<ref>{{Cite web |date=5 November 2014 |title=Letter of St. Athanasius |url=https://sspx.org/en/letter-st-athanasius |access-date=8 May 2022 |website=Society of Saint Pius X |language=en}}</ref>

The greater majority of Church leaders and the emperors fell into support for Arianism, so much so that [[Jerome]] (340–420) wrote of the period: "The whole world groaned and was amazed to find itself Arian".<ref name="ReferenceB" /> He, Athanasius, even suffered an unjust excommunication from [[Pope Liberius]] who was exiled and leant towards compromise, until he was allowed back to the See of Rome. Athanasius stood virtually alone against the world.<ref name="Butler1860" />

== Historical significance and controversies ==

=== New Testament canon ===
{{See also|Biblical canon}}

It was the custom of the bishops of Alexandria to circulate a letter after [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] each year confirming the date of Easter and therefore other moveable feasts. They also took the occasion to discuss other matters. Athanasius wrote forty-five festal letters.<ref name="Thiede">{{Cite news|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1990/issue28/2812.html|title=367 Athanasius Defines the New Testament|work=Christian History |access-date=14 March 2018|language=en}}</ref> Athanasius' ''39th Festal Letter'', written in 367, is widely regarded as a milestone in the evolution of the [[Biblical canon#Christian canons|canon of New Testament books]].<ref name=Gwynn>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaLW95rdeQoC&dq=Athanasius+of+Alexandria+++the+new+testament+canon&pg=PA152|title=Athanasius of Alexandria: Bishop, Theologian, Ascetic, Father|first=David M.|last=Gwynn|date=16 February 2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-921095-4 |via=Google Books}}</ref> Some claim that Athanasius is the first person to identify the same 27 books of the [[New Testament]] that are in use today. Up until then, various similar lists of works to be read in churches were in use. Others argue that [[Origen]] of Alexandria was the first to list the twenty-seven books of the New Testament in his Homilies on Joshua (only there is a textual variant as to whether or not he included Revelation).<ref name="Gallagher, Edmon L 2016"/><ref name="Michael J. Kruger"/> Athanasius includes the [[Book of Baruch]] and the [[Letter of Jeremiah]] and places the [[Book of Esther]] among the "7 books not in the canon but to be read" along with the [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]], [[Book of Sirach]], [[Book of Judith]], [[Book of Tobit]], the ''[[Didache]]'', and ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]''.<ref name="Robt">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEloBgAAQBAJ&dq=Athanasius+of+Alexandria+++the+new+testament+canon&pg=PA280|title=Seeing New Facets of the Diamond: Christianity as a Universal Faith - Essays in Honor of Kwame Bediako|first1=Gillian Mary|last1=Bediako|first2=Bernhardt|last2=Quarshie|first3=J.

Athanasius' list is similar to the [[Codex Vaticanus]] in the Vatican Library. The establishment of the canon was not a unilateral decision by a bishop in Alexandria but the result of a process of careful investigation and deliberation, as documented in a codex of the Greek Bible and, twenty-seven years later, in his festal letter.<ref name="Thiede" /> [[Pope Damasus I]], the bishop of Rome in 382, promulgated a list of books which contained a New Testament canon identical to that of Athanasius. A [[Synod of Hippo|synod in Hippo]] in 393 repeated Athanasius' and Damasus' New Testament list, and the [[Council of Carthage (397)]] repeated Athanasius' and Damasus' complete New Testament list.<ref>Von Dehsen, Christian.

Scholars debate whether Athanasius' list in 367 formed the basis for later lists. Because Athanasius' canon is the closest canon of any of the Church Fathers to the one used by Protestant churches today, many Protestants point to Athanasius as the Father of the Canon.<ref name="Robt" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.xxv.iii.iii.xxv.html|title=Excerpt from Letter 39 |publisher=Ccel.org |date=13 July 2005 |access-date=25 September 2012}}</ref>

=== Supporters ===
[[File:Athanasius_and_Cyril.jpg|left|thumb|Athanasius (left) and his supporter [[Cyril of Alexandria]]. 17th-century depiction.]]

Christian denominations worldwide revere Athanasius as a saint and teacher. They cite his defence of the Christology described in the first chapter of the Gospel of St. John<ref>{{bibleverse|John|1:1–4||1:1–4}}</ref> and his significant theological works ([[C. S. Lewis]] calls ''On the Incarnation of the Word of God'' a "masterpiece")<ref>Introduction to St. Athanasius on the Incarnation. Translated and edited by Sister Penelope Lawson, published by Mowbray 1944. p. 9</ref> as evidence of his righteousness. They also emphasize his close relationship with Anthony the Great, the ancient monk who was one of the founders of the Christian monastic movement.

The Gospel of St. John, and particularly the first chapter, demonstrates the Divinity of Jesus. This Gospel is the greatest support of Athanasius' stand. The Gospel of St. John's first chapter began to be said at the end of Mass, we believe as a result of Athanasius and his life's stand.<ref>{{bibleverse|John|1:1–14||1:1–14}}</ref> The beginning of John's Gospel was much used as an object of special devotion throughout the [[Middle Ages]]; the practice of saying it at the altar grew, and eventually [[Pope Pius V]] made this practice universal for the [[Roman Rite]] in his 1570 edition of the [[Missal]].<ref name="Fortescue1907">Fortescue, Adrian, Catholic Encyclopedia 1907, Volume 6, pp. 662–663 "Gospel"</ref> It became a firm custom with exceptions in using another Gospel in use from 1920.<ref name="Pope Benedict XV">Pope Benedict XV, Missale Romanum, IX Additions & Variations of the Rubrics of The Missal</ref><ref name="Jungmann">See also: Jungmann, El Sacrificio de la Misa, No. 659, 660</ref> [[Cyril of Alexandria]] (370–444) in the first letter says: "Athanasius is one who can be trusted: he would not say anything that is not in accord with sacred scripture." (Ep 1).

Throughout most of his career, Athanasius had many detractors. Classics scholar [[Timothy Barnes (classicist)|Timothy Barnes]] recounts ancient allegations against Athanasius: from defiling an altar, to selling Church grain that had been meant to feed the poor for his own personal gain, and even violence and murder to suppress dissent.<ref name = "wxdxek">Barnes, Timothy D., ''Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1993), 37</ref> According to [[Sir Isaac Newton]], Athanasius lied about the death of [[Arius]], feigned other men's letters and denied his own, murdered the bishop Arsenius, broke a communion cup, overthrew an altar, was made bishop by violence and sedition against the canons of his own church, and was seditious and immoral.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Paradoxical Questions Concerning the Morals and Actions of Athanasius and His Followers |author=Sir Isaac Newton |website=The Newton Project |url=https://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00010}}</ref> Athanasius used "Arian" to describe both followers of Arius and as a derogatory polemical term for Christians who disagreed with his formulation of the Trinity.<ref>Barnes, Timothy D., ''Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1993), 14, 128</ref> Athanasius called many of his opponents "Arian", except for [[Meletius of Antioch|Meletius]].<ref>Barnes "Athanasius and Constantius", 135</ref>

Scholars now believe that the Arian party was not monolithic<ref>Haas, Christopher, "The Arians of Alexandria", Vigiliae Christianae Vol. 47, no. 3 (1993), 239</ref> but held drastically different theological views that spanned the early Christian theological spectrum.<ref>Chadwick, Henry, "Faith and Order at the Council of Nicaea", ''Harvard Theological Review'' LIII (Cambridge Mass: 1960), 173</ref><ref>Williams, 63</ref><ref>Kannengiesser "Alexander and Arius", 403</ref> They supported the tenets of [[Origenism|Origenist]] thought and [[subordinationism|subordinationist]] theology<ref>Kannengiesser, "Athanasius of Alexandria vs. Arius: The Alexandrian Crisis", in The Roots of Egyptian Christianity (Studies in Antiquity and Christianity), ed. Birger A. Pearson and James E. Goehring (1986), 208</ref> but had little else in common. Moreover, many labelled "Arian" did not consider themselves followers of Arius.<ref>Williams, 82</ref> In addition, non-homoousian bishops disagreed with being labeled as followers of Arius, since Arius was merely a presbyter, while they were fully ordained bishops.<ref>Rubinstein, Richard, ''When Jesus Became God, The Struggle to Define Christianity during the Last Days of Rome'', 1999{{page needed|date=May 2022}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2022}}

The old allegations continue to be made against Athanasius, however, many centuries later. For example, [[Richard E. Rubenstein]] suggests that Athanasius ascended to the rank of bishop in Alexandria under questionable circumstances because some questioned whether he had reached the minimum age of 30 years, and further that Athanasius employed force when it suited his cause or personal interests. Thus, he argues that a small number of bishops who supported Athanasius held a private consecration to make him bishop.<ref>Rubenstein, Richard E., ''When Jesus Became God: The Epic Fight over Christ's Divinity in the Last Days of Rome'' (New York: Harcourt Brace & Company, 1999), 105–106</ref>
