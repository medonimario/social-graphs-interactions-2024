'''Madeleine de Scudéry''' (15 November 1607 – 2 June 1701), often known simply as '''Mademoiselle de Scudéry''', was a French writer. 

Her works also demonstrate such comprehensive knowledge of [[ancient history]] that it is suspected she had received instruction in Greek and Latin.<ref name="Donawerth_p3" /> In 1637, following the death of her uncle, Scudéry established herself in Paris with her brother, Georges de Scudéry, who became a playwright.<ref name="Donawerth_p3" /> Madeleine often used her older brother's name, [[Georges de Scudéry|George]], to publish her works.<ref name="Donawerth_p3" /> She was at once admitted to the [[Hôtel de Rambouillet]] coterie of [[précieuses|préciosité]], and afterwards established a [[salon (gathering)|salon]] of her own under the title of the ''Société du samedi'' (''Saturday Society''). For the last half of the 17th century, under the pseudonym of '''Sapho''' or her own name, she was acknowledged as the first [[bluestocking]] of France and of the world. She formed a close romantic relationship with [[Paul Pellisson]] which was only ended by his death in 1693.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} She never married.

==Biography==
Born at [[Le Havre]], Normandy, in northern France, she was without fortune, but she was exceedingly well-educated. Her father, captain of the port in Le Havre, died in 1613 with her mother following shortly after.<ref name="Donawerth_p3">{{cite book |last=Donawerth|first=Jane|title=Selected letters, orations, and rhetorical dialogues|url=https://archive.org/details/selectedletterso00scud|url-access=limited|year=2004|publisher=The University of Chicago Press, Ltd., London|location=United States|isbn=0-226-14403-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/selectedletterso00scud/page/n35 3]}}</ref> Madeleine and her brother Georges de Scudéry were placed in the care of an uncle who cared for them very well.<ref name="Donawerth_p3"/> He gave Madeleine an abnormally well-rounded education: she studied writing, spelling, drawing, dancing, painting, and [[needlework]].<ref name="Donawerth_p3"/> In addition, on her own, Madeleine studied agriculture, medicine, cooking, Spanish, and Italian.<ref name="Donawerth_p3"/> 

==Works==
{{French literature sidebar}}
Her lengthy novels, such as ''[[Artamène|Artamène, ou le Grand Cyrus]]'' (10 vols., 1648–53), ''Clélie'' (10 vols., 1654–61), ''Ibrahim, ou l'illustre Bassa'' (4 vols., 1641), ''Almahide, ou l'esclave reine'' (8 vols., 1661–63) were the delight of Europe, commended by other literary figures such as [[Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de Sévigné|Madame de Sévigné]]. ''Artamène'', which contains about 2.1 million words, ranks among the longest novels ever published. Her novels derive their length from endless conversations and, as far as incidents go, successive abductions of the heroines, conceived and told decorously.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Contemporary readers also enjoyed these novels because they gave a glimpse into the life of important society figures.<ref name="Donawerth_pp181-199">{{cite journal |last=Donawerth|first=Jane|title=Conversation and the Boundaries of Public Discourse in Rhetorical Theory by Renaissance Women|journal=[[Rhetorica]]|date=Spring 1992|volume=16|issue=2|pages=181–199|doi=10.1525/rh.1998.16.2.181|jstor=10.1525/rh.1998.16.2.181|s2cid=144427935 }}</ref> These figures were often disguised as Persian, Greek, and Roman warriors and maidens.<ref name="Donawerth_pp181-199"/> In fact, Scudéry created the [[roman à clef]] to provide a forum for her thinly veiled fiction featuring political and public figures.<ref name="ro.uow.edu.au">{{Cite web |date=2009 |title=The Modernist roman à clef and Cultural Secrets, or I Know That You Know That I Know That You Know |url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1226&context=artspapers}}</ref>

''Les Femmes Illustres'' (1642) addresses itself to women and defends education, rather than the beauty or cosmetic, as a means of social mobility for women.<ref name="Donawerth_pp181-199"/> This text was a means to justify women's participation in rhetoric and literary culture.<ref name="Donawerth_pp181-199"/> It uses women speakers as models for the speeches, including [[Cleopatra]] of Egypt.<ref name="Donawerth_pp181-199"/> In ''Les Femmes Illustres'' (1642), ''Conversations Sur Divers Sujets'' (1680), and ''Conversations Nouvelles sur Divers Sujets, Dediees Au Roy'' (1684), Madeleine de Scudéry adapted classical rhetorical theory from [[Cicero]], [[Quintilian]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[sophists]] to a theory of salon conversation and letter writing.<ref name="Donawerth_pp181-199"/> Scudéry's Conversations Sur Divers Sujets, included [[dialogue]]s covering "Conversation," "The Art of Speaking," "Raillery," "Invention," and "The Manner of Writing Letters."<ref name="Donawerth_pp181-199"/> This text offers the rhetoric of salon conversation and model scenarios where women take intellectual control of the conversation.<ref name="Donawerth_pp181-199"/> Other works devoted to conversations, pertaining to the education of women include: "The Slave Queen" (1660), "Mathilda of Aguilar, a Spanish Tale," (1667), and "The Versailles Promenade, or the Tale of Celanire" (1669).<ref name="Donawerth_pp181-199"/> These covered the art of speaking, [[invention]], the manner of writing letters, and scenarios where women had control of the intellectual conversation.<ref name="Donawerth_pp181-199"/>

Scudéry's novels are usually set in the classical world or "the Orient", but their language and action reflect fashionable ideas of the 17th century, and the [[Roman à clef|characters can be identified]] with Mademoiselle de Scudéry's contemporaries. In ''Clélie'', Herminius represents Paul Pellisson; Scaurus and Lyriane were [[Paul Scarron]] and his wife (who became [[Françoise d'Aubigné, marquise de Maintenon|Mme de Maintenon]]); and in the description of Sapho in vol. 10 of ''Le Grand Cyrus'' the author paints herself.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In ''Clélie'', Scudéry invented the famous ''[[Carte de Tendre]]'', a map of an [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] where the geography is all based around the theme of love: the river of Inclination flows past the villages of "Billet Doux" ([[love letter]]), "Petits Soins" (Little Trinkets) and so forth.<ref>JS Munor, ''Mademoiselle de Scudéry and the Carte de Tendre'' 1986</ref>
Scudéry was a skilled conversationalist; several volumes purporting to report her conversations upon various topics were published during her lifetime. She had a distinct vocation as a pedagogue.
[[File:Scudery, Le Pays de Tendre, 1800, Cornell, CUL PJM 1029 01.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Carte de Tendre was "conceived as a social game during the Winter of 1653–1654" by Madeleine de Scudery, and a printed copy was "later incorporated into the first volume of her coded novel, ''Clelie''." (Reitinger 1999, 109).]]

==Later years==
Madeleine survived her brother by more than thirty years, and in her later days published numerous volumes of conversations, to a great extent extracted from her novels, thus forming a kind of anthology of her work. Scudéry was deaf for the last 40 years of her life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Donawerth|first=Jane|title=Rhetorical Theory by Women before 1900|year=2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=United States|isbn=0-7425-1716-0|pages=82}}</ref> She outlived her vogue to some extent, but retained a circle of friends, like [[Marie Dupré]], to whom she was always the "incomparable Sapho."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Her ''Life and Correspondence'' was published at Paris by MM. Rathery and Boutron in 1873.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Legacy==

Madeleine de Scudéry was part of a movement in the late Renaissance in England and France where women used classical rhetorical theory for their own.<ref name="Donawerth_pp181-199"/> She revised discourse to be modeled on conversation rather than public speaking, favoring that as a means of [[rhetoric]], the speaker in the salon built on the ideas of the speaker before them, opting for consensus rather than argument.<ref name="Donawerth_pp181-199"/> She is one of the central figures associated with the "[[salon (gathering)|salon]]" conversation and letter writing.

==Cultural references==
Controversial in her own era, Mademoiselle de Scudéry was satirized by [[Molière]] in his plays ''[[Les Précieuses ridicules]]'' (1659) and ''[[Les Femmes savantes]]'' (1672) and by [[Antoine Furetière]] in his ''[[Roman Bourgeois]]'' (1666).

The 19th century German writer [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] wrote what is usually referred to as the first German-language [[Detective fiction|detective story]], featuring Scudéry as the central figure. "[[Mademoiselle de Scuderi|Das Fräulein von Scuderi]]" (Mademoiselle de Scudery) is still widely read today, and is the origin of the "Cardillac syndrome" in psychology.{{Clarification needed|date=January 2019}}

Mademoiselle de Scudéry is also featured prominently in ''Madeleine: One of Love's Jansenists'', a novel published in 1919 by modernist writer [[Hope Mirrlees]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://hopemirrlees.com/texts/madeleine.html |title=Madeleine: One of Love's Jansenists |first=Hope |last=Mirrlees |publisher=Collins Sons & Co. |year=1919}}</ref> The novel is set in and around the literary circles of the 17th Century [[Précieuses]]. The protagonist, a young woman named Madeleine Troqueville, becomes enamored of Mademoiselle de Scudéry, who snubs young Madeleine. It has been suggested that the novel is a [[roman à clef]] with [[Natalie Clifford Barney]] portrayed as Mademoiselle de Scudéry.<ref>Briggs, Julia. ''Reading Virginia Woolf''.
