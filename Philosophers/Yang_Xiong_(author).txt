'''Yang Xiong''' ({{zh|t=揚雄}}; 53 BCE{{snd}}18 CE) was a Chinese philosopher, poet, and politician of the [[Western Han dynasty]] known for his philosophical writings and [[fu (poetry)|''fu'' poetry]] compositions.

== Life and career ==

Like a number of the other well-known writers of the Han dynasty, Yang was from [[Shu (state)|Shu]] (modern [[Sichuan]] province), specifically the area of Pi (modern [[Pi County]], Sichuan). Yang claimed that his family had moved south from the [[Jin (Chinese state)|state of Jin]] during its civil infighting in the 6th century BCE.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=1837}}  As a youth Yang was an admirer and imitator of his elder Shu compatriot [[Sima Xiangru]] and the "grand ''fu''" style of the early Han period.  His ability and success in ''fu'' composition earned him a summons to the imperial capital at [[Chang'an]] to serve as an "Expectant Official", responsible for composing poems and ''fu'' for the emperor.<ref name="ho912">Ho (1986): 912.</ref>

Yang's position required him to praise the virtue and glory of [[Emperor Cheng of Han]] and the grandeur of imperial outings, but he was disturbed by the wasteful extravagance of the imperial court.<ref name="ho912" /> Yang attempted to return the ''fu'' genre to a focus of "suasive admonition" ({{zhi|c=諷|p=fèng}}), which he believed was the original purpose of the earliest ''fu''-type writings of [[Qu Yuan]], but his couched admonitions against extravagance went unnoticed and unheeded by Emperor Cheng.

Yang's most famous work is the ''[[Fayan (book)|Fayan]]'', a philosophical work modeled on the ''[[Analects]]'', in which Yang criticizes ''fu'' writers for focusing on ornate, esoteric language while ignoring more important issues of morality. Yang's other works include the ''[[Taixuanjing]]'', a divination text based on the ''[[I Ching]]'', "Justification Against Ridicule" ({{zhi|c=解嘲|p=Jiě cháo}}), one of the best known examples of the "''fu'' of frustration" subgenre, and the ''[[Fangyan (book)|Fangyan]]'', a dictionary documenting regional vocabulary from throughout China at the time.

Together with [[Sima Xiangru]], Yang was one of the most famous and illustrious figures of the entire Han dynasty. The ''[[Book of Han]]'' devotes a full two-part chapter to both Yang and Sima, an honor surpassing that of even the most famous generals and ministers.<ref>Knechtges (1982): 1.</ref>

== Philosophy ==
Yang did not believe human nature was inherently good as [[Mencius]] ({{fl.|4th century BCE}}) had written, nor inherently bad as [[Xunzi (philosopher)|Xunzi]] ({{circa|300&ndash;230 BCE}}) had written, but came into existence as a mixture of both.  He was a close associate of the official and philosopher [[Huan Tan]] (d. 28 CE), an [[Old Texts]] realist who may have heavily influenced the works of [[Wang Chong]] (27&ndash;c. 100 CE). Yang is also known for his protest against the verbosity of the ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]''. He was hailed by Huan Tan as the "Confucius from the western parts".
