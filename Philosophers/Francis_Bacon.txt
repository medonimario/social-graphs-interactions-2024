'''Francis Bacon''', '''1st Viscount St Alban,'''{{Efn|name=title|There is confusion over the spelling of Bacon's title.

Bacon argued the importance of [[natural philosophy]], guided by [[scientific method]], and his works remained influential throughout the [[Scientific Revolution]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Klein |first=Jürgen |title=Francis Bacon |date=2012 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/francis-bacon/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Winter 2016 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=17 January 2020}}</ref>

Bacon has been called the father of [[empiricism]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Partner |editor1-first=Nancy |editor2-last=Foot |editor2-first=Sarah |title=SAGE Handbook of Historical Theory |chapter=Empiricism and its configurations in the history of epistemology |date=31 January 2013 |quote=The first philosopher who developed an empiricist programme of scholarly knowledge was Francis Bacon (1561–1626), whose arguments were systematised by his followers. |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|SAGE]] |isbn=9781412931144}}</ref> He argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon [[inductive reasoning]] and careful observation of events in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]]. He believed that science could be achieved by the use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. Although his most specific proposals about such a method, the [[Baconian method]], did not have long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon one of the later founders of the scientific method. His portion of the method based in scepticism was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, whose practical details are still central to debates on science and [[methodology]]. He is famous for his role in the scientific revolution, promoting scientific experimentation as a way of glorifying God and fulfilling scripture.

Bacon was a patron of libraries and developed a system for cataloguing books under three categories&nbsp;– [[history]], [[poetry]], and [[philosophy]]&nbsp;– <ref>{{cite web |title=The classification of Harris: Influences of Bacon and Hegel in the universe of library classification |url= https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/download/15230/12688 |publisher=University of Washington |date=2017}}</ref> which could further be divided into specific subjects and subheadings.

Bacon was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he rigorously followed the medieval curriculum, which was presented largely in [[Latin]]. He was the first recipient of the [[Queen's counsel]] designation, conferred in 1597 when [[Elizabeth&nbsp;I]] reserved him as her legal advisor. After the accession of [[James VI and I|James&nbsp;I]] in 1603, Bacon was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]], then created [[Baron Verulam]] in 1618{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=200}} and Viscount St Alban in 1621.{{sfn|Peltonen|2007}}{{efn|Contemporary spelling, used by Bacon himself in his letter of thanks to the king for his elevation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Birch |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Birch |title=Letters, Speeches, Charges, Advices, &c of Lord Chancellor Bacon |volume=6 |year=1763 |publisher=Andrew Millar |location=London |pages=271–272 |oclc=228676038}}</ref>}} He had no heirs, and so both titles became extinct on his death of pneumonia in 1626 at the age of 65.

Francis Bacon was born on 22 January 1561<ref>{{Cite ODNB |last=Peltonen |first=Markku |date=23 September 2004 |title=Bacon, Francis, Viscount St Alban (1561–1626) |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/990 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/990 }}</ref> at [[York House, Strand|York House]] near [[Strand, London|Strand]] in [[London]], the son of [[Nicholas Bacon (Lord Keeper)|Sir Nicholas Bacon]] ([[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal]]) by his second wife, [[Anne Bacon|Anne (Cooke) Bacon]], the daughter of the noted [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] [[Anthony Cooke]]. His mother's sister was married to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], making Burghley Bacon's uncle.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=816}}

Biographers believe that Bacon was educated at home in his early years owing to poor health, which would plague him throughout his life. He received tuition from John Walsall, a graduate of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] with a strong leaning toward [[Puritans|Puritanism]]. He attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] on 5 April 1573 at the age of 12,<ref>{{acad|id=BCN573F|name=Bacon, Francis }}</ref> living there for three years along with his older brother [[Anthony Bacon (1558–1601)]] under the personal tutelage of [[John Whitgift]], future [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Bacon's education was conducted largely in Latin and followed the medieval curriculum. It was at [[Cambridge]] that Bacon first met [[Queen Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]], who was impressed by his precocious intellect, and was accustomed to calling him "The young lord keeper".<ref>{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Arthur |title=The English Baronetage: Containing a Genealogical and Historical Account of All the English Baronets, Now Existing: Their Descents, Marriages, and Issues; Memorable Actions, Both in War, and Peace; Religious and Charitable Donations; Deaths, Places of Burial and Monumental Inscriptions |publisher=Printed for Tho. Wotton at the Three Daggers and Queen's Head |year=1741 |page=5 }}</ref>

His studies brought him to the belief that the methods and results of science as then practised were erroneous. His reverence for [[Aristotle]] conflicted with his rejection of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]], which seemed to him barren, argumentative and wrong in its objectives.<ref>Crosbie, Christopher. “Francis Bacon and Aristotelian Afterlives,” in A Companion to British Literature, ed. Robert DeMaria Jr., Heesok Chang, and Samantha Zacher, vol 2. (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2014), 231-248.  https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:58062/datastreams/CONTENT/content</ref>

On 27 June 1576, he and Anthony entered ''de societate magistrorum'' at [[Gray's Inn]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=de Montmorency |first=J.E.G |date=1905 |title=Francis Bacon |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/752041 |journal=Journal of the Society of Comparative Legislation |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=264 |jstor=752041 |via=JSTOR}}</ref> A few months later, Francis went abroad with Sir [[Amias Paulet]], the English ambassador at Paris, while Anthony continued his studies at home. The state of government and society in France under [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] afforded him valuable political instruction.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} For the next three years he visited [[Blois]], [[Poitiers]], [[Tours]], Italy, and Spain.<ref name="travels">[[Stephen Gaukroger]] (2001). ''Francis Bacon and the Transformation of Early-Modern Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, p. 46.</ref> There is no evidence that he studied at the [[University of Poitiers]].<ref>Francis Bacon, ''The Advancement of Learning'', Clarendon Press, 1876, p. ix.</ref> During his travels, Bacon studied language, statecraft, and civil law while performing routine diplomatic tasks. On at least one occasion he delivered diplomatic letters to England for [[Francis Walsingham|Walsingham]], Burghley, [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Leicester]], and for the queen.<ref name="travels" />

The sudden death of his father in February 1579 prompted Bacon to return to England. Sir Nicholas had laid up a considerable sum of money to purchase an estate for his youngest son, but he died before doing so, and Francis was left with only a fifth of that money.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} Having borrowed money, Bacon got into debt. To support himself, he took up his residence in law at Gray's Inn in 1579,{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} his income being supplemented by a grant from his mother Lady Anne of the manor of [[Marks (manor house)|Marks]] near [[Romford]] in Essex, which generated a rent of £46.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Spall |first = JEH |title = Francis Bacon's connections with Marks Manor House |journal = Romford Record |volume = 4 |pages = 32–37 |publisher = Romford and District Historical Society |location = Romford |date = 1971}}</ref>

===Parliamentarian===
[[File:Statue of Francis Bacon (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1|Bacon's statue at [[Gray's Inn]] in London's South Square]]
Bacon stated that he had three goals: to uncover truth, to serve his country, and to serve his church. He sought to achieve these goals by seeking a prestigious post. In 1580, through his uncle, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], he applied for a post at court that might enable him to pursue a life of learning, but his application failed. For two years he worked quietly at [[Gray's Inn]], until he was admitted as an [[outer barrister]] in 1582.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Robert. P.|title=Francis Bacon: The Double-Edged Life of the Philosopher and Statesman|year=2015|publisher=McFarland|page=28}}</ref>

His parliamentary career began when he was elected [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for [[Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency)|Bossiney, Cornwall]], in a [[by-election]] in 1581. In 1584 he took his seat in [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] for [[Melcombe Regis (UK Parliament constituency)|Melcombe]] in Dorset, and in 1586 for [[Taunton (UK Parliament constituency)|Taunton]]. At this time, he began to write on the condition of parties in the church, as well as on the topic of philosophical reform in the lost tract ''Temporis Partus Maximus''. Yet he failed to gain a position that he thought would lead him to success.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} He showed signs of sympathy to Puritanism, attending the sermons of the Puritan chaplain of Gray's Inn and accompanying his mother to the [[Temple Church]] to hear [[Walter Travers]]. This led to the publication of his earliest surviving tract, which criticized the English church's suppression of the Puritan clergy. In the Parliament of 1586, he openly urged execution for the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].<ref>Jardine, L. (1986), ''Francis Bacon: Discovery and the Art of Discourse'', Cambridge University Press.</ref>

About this time, he again approached his powerful uncle for help; this move was followed by his rapid progress at the bar. He became a [[bencher]] in 1586 and was elected a [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Reader]] in 1587, delivering his first set of lectures in Lent the following year. In 1589, he received the valuable appointment of [[Reversion (law)|reversion]] to the Clerkship of the [[Star Chamber]], although he did not formally take office until 1608; the post was worth £1,600 a year.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}}{{sfn|Peltonen|2007}}

In 1588 he became MP for [[Liverpool (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool]] and then for [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]] in 1593. He later sat three times for [[Ipswich (UK Parliament constituency)|Ipswich]] (1597, 1601, 1604) and once for [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] (1614).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/bacon-francis-1561-1626 |title=History of Parliament |access-date=2 October 2011}}

He became known as a liberal-minded reformer, eager to amend and simplify the law. Though a friend of the crown, he opposed feudal privileges and dictatorial powers. He spoke against religious persecution. He struck at the House of Lords in its usurpation of the Money Bills. He advocated for the union of England and Scotland, which made him a significant influence toward the consolidation of the United Kingdom; and he later would advocate for the integration of Ireland into the Union. Closer constitutional ties, he believed, would bring greater peace and strength to these countries.<ref name="letters">{{cite journal |last=Spedding |first=James |title=The letters and life of Francis Bacon |year=1861 }}</ref><ref name="ecc.015">{{cite web |url=http://publish.ucc.ie/celt/docs/E600001-015 |title=Sir Francis Bacon's Letters, Tracts and Speech relating to Ireland |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807142316/http://publish.ucc.ie/celt/docs/E600001-015 |access-date=24 January 2013 }}</ref>

===Final years of Elizabeth's reign===
[[File:StatueOfFrancisBacon.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Memorial to Bacon in the chapel of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]
Bacon soon became acquainted with [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Robert Devereux, the 2nd Earl of Essex]], Queen Elizabeth's favourite.<ref name="Hammer" /> By 1591 he acted as the earl's confidential adviser.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}}<ref name="Hammer">Paul E. J. Hammer (1999). "The Polarisation of Elizabethan Politics: The Political Career of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, 1585–1597". p. 141. Cambridge University Press</ref> In 1592, he was commissioned to write a tract in response to the [[Jesuit]] [[Robert Parsons (Jesuit)|Robert Parson]]'s anti-government polemic, which he titled ''Certain Observations Made upon a Libel'', identifying England with the ideals of democratic [[History of Athens|Athens]] against the belligerence of Spain.<ref>Gustav Ungerer (1974). "A Spaniard in Elizabethan England: The Correspondence of Antonio Pérez's Exile, Volume 1". p. 207. Tamesis Books</ref> Bacon took his third parliamentary seat for [[Middlesex]] when in February 1593 Elizabeth summoned Parliament to investigate a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] plot against her. Bacon's opposition to a bill that would levy triple subsidies in half the usual time offended the Queen: opponents accused him of seeking popularity, and for a time the Court excluded him from favour.<ref>Weir, Alison ''Elizabeth the Queen'' Pimlico 1999 p. 414</ref>

When the office of [[Attorney-General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] fell vacant in 1594, Lord Essex's influence was not enough to secure the position for Bacon and it was given to Sir [[Edward Coke]]. Likewise, Bacon failed to secure the lesser office of [[Solicitor-General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] in 1595, the Queen pointedly snubbing him by appointing Sir [[Thomas Fleming (judge)|Thomas Fleming]] instead.{{sfn|Peltonen|2007}} To console him for these disappointments, Essex presented him with a property at [[Twickenham]], which Bacon subsequently sold for £1,800.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bunten|first1=Alice Chambers|title=Twickenham Park and Old Richmond Palace and Francis Bacon: Lord Verulam's Connection with The, 1580–1608|publisher=R. Banks|page=19}}</ref>

In 1597 Bacon became the first [[Queen's Counsel]] designate, when Queen Elizabeth reserved him as her legal counsel.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of English Law|last=Holdsworth|first=W. S.|year=1938|pages=vi 473–474}}</ref> In 1597, he was also given a patent, giving him precedence at the Bar.<ref>''[[Patent Rolls]]'', 2 Jac I p. 12 m 10.</ref> Despite his designations, he was unable to gain the status and notoriety of others. In a plan to revive his position he unsuccessfully courted the wealthy young widow Lady [[Elizabeth Hatton]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Curious Case of Lady Purbeck; A Scandal of the XVIIth Century|last=Longueville|first=Thomas|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|year=1909|location=London|page=4}}</ref> His courtship failed after she broke off their relationship upon accepting marriage to Sir Edward Coke, a further spark of enmity between the men.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aughterson|first=Kate|title=Hatton, Elizabeth, Lady Hatton [nee Lady Elizabeth Cecil] (1578–1646)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|via=Oxford University Press}}</ref> In 1598 Bacon was arrested for debt. Afterward, however, his standing in the Queen's eyes improved. Gradually, Bacon earned the standing of one of the learned counsels.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=137}} His relationship with the Queen further improved when he severed ties with Essex—a shrewd move, as Essex would be executed for treason in 1601.<ref>{{cite book|title=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia|date= 2008|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=636}}</ref>

With others, Bacon was appointed to investigate the charges against Essex. A number of Essex's followers confessed that Essex had planned a rebellion against the Queen.<ref name="Character Assassination">Nieves Matthews, ''Francis Bacon: The History of a Character Assassination'' (Yale University Press, 1996)</ref> Bacon was subsequently a part of the legal team headed by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] Sir Edward Coke at Essex's treason trial.<ref name="Character Assassination" /> After the execution, the Queen ordered Bacon to write the official government account of the trial, which was later published as ''A DECLARATION of the Practices and Treasons attempted and committed by Robert late Earle of Essex and his Complices, against her Majestie and her Kingdoms ...'' after Bacon's first draft was heavily edited by the Queen and her ministers.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=138}}<ref>Matthews (1996: 56–57)</ref>

According to his personal secretary and chaplain, [[William Rawley]], as a judge Bacon was always tender-hearted, "looking upon the examples with the eye of severity, but upon the person with the eye of pity and compassion". And also that "he was free from malice", "no revenger of injuries", and "no defamer of any man".<ref name="Rawley">{{cite book |last=Rawley |first=William |title=The Life of the Right Honorable Francis Bacon Baron of Verulam, Viscount St. Alban |year=1670 |publisher=Thomas Johns |location=London |url=http://hiwaay.net/~paul/bacon/biographies/rawley.html |access-date=4 February 2012 |archive-date=5 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190805052919/http://hiwaay.net/~paul/bacon/biographies/rawley.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===James I comes to the throne===
[[File:Francis Bacon, Viscount St Alban from NPG (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1|alt=Portrait of Sir Francis Bacon|Bacon, {{circa}} 1618]]
The succession of [[James I of England|James I]] brought Bacon into greater favour. He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1603. In another shrewd move, Bacon wrote his ''Apologies'' in defence of his proceedings in the case of Essex, as Essex had favoured James to succeed to the throne. The following year, during the course of the uneventful first parliamentary session, Bacon married [[Alice Barnham]].{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=139}} In June 1607, he was at last rewarded with the office of Solicitor General{{sfn|Peltonen|2007}} and in 1608 he began working as the Clerkship of the [[Star Chamber]]. Despite a generous income, old debts still could not be paid. He sought further promotion and wealth by supporting King James and his arbitrary policies. In 1610 the fourth session of James's first [[James I of England and the English Parliament|Parliament]] met. Despite Bacon's advice to him, James and the Commons found themselves at odds over royal prerogatives and the King's embarrassing extravagance. The House was finally dissolved in February 1611. Throughout this period Bacon managed to stay in favour with the King while retaining the confidence of the Commons.

In 1613 Bacon was finally appointed [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], after advising the King to shuffle judicial appointments. As Attorney General, Bacon, by his zealous efforts—which included torture—to obtain the conviction of [[Edmund Peacham]] for treason, raised legal controversies of high constitutional importance.<ref>{{cite DNB |wstitle= Peacham, Edmond |volume= 44 |last= Lee |first= Sidney |author-link= Sidney Lee |pages= 131-133 |short= 1}}</ref> Bacon and [[Gray's Inn]] produced ''[[The Masque of Flowers]]'' to celebrate the wedding of [[Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset]] and his wife, [[Frances Howard, Countess of Somerset]],<ref>Christine Adams, 'Francis Bacon's Wedding Gift of A Garden of a Glorious and Strange Beauty for the Earl and Countess of Somerset', ''Garden History'', 36:1 (Spring 2008), p. 45.</ref> and he successfully prosecuted them for murder in 1616.

The so-called Prince's Parliament of April 1614 objected to Bacon's presence in the seat for [[University of Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] and to the various royal plans that Bacon had supported. Although he was allowed to stay, Parliament passed a law that forbade the Attorney General to sit in Parliament. His influence over the King had evidently inspired resentment or apprehension in many of his peers. Bacon, however, continued to receive the King's favour, which led to his appointment in March 1617 as temporary Regent of England (for a period of a month), and in 1618 as [[Lord Chancellor]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Principe |first=Lawrence M. |title=The Scientific Revolution: A Very Short Introduction |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0199567416 |edition=1st |pages=128}}</ref> On 12 July 1618 the King created Bacon [[Baron Verulam]] of [[Verulamium|Verulam]] in the [[Peerage of England]]; he then became known as Francis, Lord Verulam.{{sfn|Peltonen|2007}}

Bacon continued to use his influence with the King to mediate between the throne and Parliament, and in this capacity he was further elevated in the same peerage as [[Viscount St Alban]] on 27 January 1621.<ref>{{cite book|title=CSPD James I, 1619-1623|page=116}}</ref>

Bacon's public career ended in disgrace in 1621. After he fell into debt, a parliamentary committee on the administration of the law charged him with 23 separate counts of corruption. His lifelong enemy, Sir [[Edward Coke]], who had instigated these accusations,<ref>{{citation |first=Ian |last=Ousby |year=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43oBE1nJXaMC |title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Literature in English |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=22 |postscript=. |isbn=978-0-521-43627-4 }}</ref> was one of those appointed to prepare the charges against the chancellor.<ref>{{citation |first=Perez |last=Zagorin |year=1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoKwR_8FBYcC |title=Francis Bacon |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=22 |postscript=. |isbn=978-0-691-00966-7 }}</ref> To the lords, who sent a committee to enquire whether a confession was really his, he replied, "My lords, it is my act, my hand, and my heart; I beseech your lordships to be merciful to a broken reed." He was sentenced to a fine of £40,000 and committed to the [[Tower of London]] at the king's pleasure; the imprisonment lasted only a few days and the fine was remitted by the king.<ref name="mpkm">{{cite book |last1=Parris |first1=Matthew |author1-link=Matthew Parris |author2-link=Kevin Maguire (journalist) |last2=Maguire |first2=Kevin |title=Great Parliamentary Scandals |publisher=Chrysalis |location=London |year=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/greatparliamenta0000parr/page/8 8–9] |chapter=Francis Bacon – 1621 |isbn=978-1-86105-736-5 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/greatparliamenta0000parr/page/8 }}</ref> More seriously, parliament declared Bacon incapable of holding future office or sitting in parliament. He narrowly escaped undergoing [[Cashiering|degradation]], which would have stripped him of his titles of nobility. Subsequently, the disgraced viscount devoted himself to study and writing.

There seems little doubt that Bacon had accepted gifts from litigants, but this was an accepted custom of the time and not necessarily evidence of deeply corrupt behaviour.<ref name="pz">{{cite book |last=Zagorin |first=Perez |author-link=Perez Zagorin |title=Francis Bacon |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |year=1999 |pages=22–23 |isbn=978-0-691-00966-7 }}</ref> While acknowledging that his conduct had been lax, he countered that he had never [[bribery|allowed gifts to influence his judgement]] and, indeed, he had on occasion given a verdict against those who had paid him. He even had an interview with King James in which he assured:
{{Blockquote |The law of nature teaches me to speak in my own defence: With respect to this charge of bribery I am as innocent as any man born on St. Innocents Day. I never had a bribe or reward in my eye or thought when pronouncing judgment or order... I am ready to make an oblation of myself to the King|17 April 1621<ref>Campbell, John; Baron Campbell (1818), J. Murray. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=8GMoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA404 The Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of England]"</ref>}}

He also wrote the following to [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]]:
{{Blockquote |My mind is calm, for my fortune is not my felicity. I know I have clean hands and a clean heart, and I hope a clean house for friends or servants; but Job himself, or whoever was the justest judge, by such hunting for matters against him as hath been used against me, may for a time seem foul, especially in a time when greatness is the mark and accusation is the game.{{sfn|Fowler|1885|p=347}} }}

As the conduct of accepting gifts was ubiquitous and common practice, and the Commons was zealously inquiring into judicial corruption and malfeasance, it has been suggested that Bacon served as a scapegoat to divert attention from Buckingham's own ill practice and alleged corruption.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Express |first=Britain |title=The Duke of Buckingham and Sir Francis Bacon |url=https://www.britainexpress.com/History/Buckingham-Bacon.htm |access-date=31 October 2022 |website=Britain Express |language=en}}</ref>

The true reason for his acknowledgement of guilt is the subject of debate, but some authors speculate that it may have been prompted by his sickness, or by a view that through his fame and the greatness of his office he would be spared harsh punishment. He may even have been blackmailed, with a threat to charge him with [[sodomy]], into confession.<ref name="pz" /><ref>[[A. L. Rowse]], quoted in Parris; Maguire (2004: 8): "a charge of sodomy was... to be brought against the sixty-year-old Lord Chancellor".</ref>

The British jurist [[Basil Montagu]] wrote in Bacon's defense, concerning the episode of his public disgrace:
{{Blockquote |Bacon has been accused of servility, of dissimulation, of various base motives, and their filthy brood of base actions, all unworthy of his high birth, and incompatible with his great wisdom, and the estimation in which he was held by the noblest spirits of the age. It is true that there were men in his own time, and will be men in all times, who are better pleased to count spots in the sun than to rejoice in its glorious brightness. Such men have openly libelled him, like Dewes and Weldon, whose falsehoods were detected as soon as uttered, or have fastened upon certain ceremonious compliments and dedications, the fashion of his day, as a sample of his servility, passing over his noble letters to the Queen, his lofty contempt for the Lord Keeper Puckering, his open dealing with Sir Robert Cecil, and with others, who, powerful when he was nothing, might have blighted his opening fortunes for ever, forgetting his advocacy of the rights of the people in the face of the court, and the true and honest counsels, always given by him, in times of great difficulty, both to Elizabeth and her successor. When was a "base sycophant" loved and honoured by piety such as that of Herbert, Tennison, and Rawley, by noble spirits like Hobbes, Ben Jonson, and Selden, or followed to the grave, and beyond it, with devoted affection such as that of Sir Thomas Meautys.<ref>{{cite book |last=Montagu |first=Basil |title=Essays and Selections |year=1837 |isbn=978-1-4368-3777-4 |pages=325–326 |publisher=Kessinger }}</ref>}}

===Personal life===
====Religious beliefs====
Bacon was a devout [[Anglican]]. He believed that philosophy and the natural world must be studied inductively, but argued that we can only study arguments for the existence of God. Information about God's attributes (such as nature, action, and purposes) can only come from [[special revelation]]. Bacon also held that knowledge was cumulative, that study encompassed more than a simple preservation of the past. "Knowledge is the rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator and the relief of man's estate," he wrote. In his Essays, he affirms that "a little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion."<ref name="EssayesOrCovnsels">{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Francis |title=The Essayes Or Covnsels, Civill and Morall, of Francis Lo. Vervlam, Viscovnt St. Alban |date=1625 |location=London |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdsAYAAACAAJ |access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref>

Bacon's idea of [[Novum Organum#The Idols (Idola)|idols of the mind]] may have self-consciously represented an attempt to Christianize science at the same time as developing a new, reliable scientific method; Bacon gave worship of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] as an example of the [[idola tribus]] fallacy, hinting at the religious dimensions of his critique of the idols.{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|pp=48–49}}

Bacon was against the splintering within Christianity, believing that it would ultimately lead to the creation of atheism as a dominant worldview, as indicated with his quote that "The causes of atheism are: divisions in religion, if they be many; for any one main division, addeth zeal to both sides; but many divisions introduce atheism. Another is, scandal of priests; when it is come to that which St. Bernard saith "One cannot now say the priest is as the people, for the truth is that the people are not so bad as the priest". A third is, custom of profane scoffing in holy matters; which doth by little and little deface the reverence of religion. And lastly, learned times, specially with peace and prosperity; for troubles and adversities do more bow men's minds to religion."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Francis |title=Essays, Civil and Moral.

====Architectural projects====

====Marriage to Alice Barnham====
{{see also|Alice Barnham}}
[[File:Alice Barnham.gif|thumb|upright=1|Engraving of [[Alice Barnham]]]]
When he was 36, Bacon courted [[Elizabeth Hatton]], a young widow of 20. Reportedly, she broke off their relationship upon accepting marriage to a wealthier man, Bacon's rival, Sir [[Edward Coke]]. Years later, Bacon still wrote of his regret that the marriage to Hatton had not taken place.<ref name="Dodd-Life-Story">Alfred Dodd, ''Francis Bacon's Personal Life Story', Volume 2 – The Age of James'', England: Rider & Co., 1949, 1986. pp. 157–158, 425, 502–503, 518–532</ref>

At the age of 45, Bacon married [[Alice Barnham]], the 13-year-old daughter of a well-connected London [[alderman]] and MP. Bacon wrote two sonnets proclaiming his love for Alice. The first was written during his courtship and the second on his wedding day, 10 May 1606. When Bacon was appointed lord chancellor, "by special Warrant of the King", Lady Bacon was given precedence over all other Court ladies. Bacon's personal secretary and chaplain, William Rawley, wrote in his biography of Bacon that his marriage was one of "much conjugal love and respect", mentioning a robe of honour that he gave to Alice and which "she wore unto her dying day, being twenty years and more after his death".<ref name="Rawley" />

However, an increasing number of reports circulated about friction in the marriage, with speculation that this may have been due to Alice's making do with less money than she had once been accustomed to. It was said that she was strongly interested in fame and fortune, and when household finances dwindled, she complained bitterly. Bunten wrote in her ''Life of Alice Barnham''&nbsp;<ref>Alice Chambers Bunten, ''Life of Alice Barnham, Wife of Sir Francis Bacon'', London: Oliphants Ltd. 1928.</ref> that, upon their descent into debt, she went on trips to ask for financial favours and assistance from their circle of friends. Bacon disinherited her upon discovering her secret romantic relationship with [[John Underhill (courtier)|Sir John Underhill]], rewriting his will (which had generously planned to leave her lands, goods, and income) and revoking her entirely as a beneficiary.

====Sexuality====
Several authors believe that, despite his marriage,{{efn|In ''[[New Atlantis]]'', Bacon's Joabin writes of men who "marry late, when the prime of strength and their years is past". "[W]hat is marriage to them but a very bargain; wherein is sought alliance, or portion, or reputation", he argues, since they continue to visit "dissolute places" for "meretricious embracements (where sin is turned into art)", a custom "no more punished ... than in bachelors".{{sfn|Cady|1992|loc=17–18, quoting ''New Atlantis'' 281–283}} Literature and sexuality scholar Joseph Cady noted that Bacon may have written this from a personal perspective, as his own marriage was "'late', childless, and {{lang|lt|pro forma}}".{{sfn|Cady|1992|loc=18}}}} Bacon was primarily attracted to men.<ref>A.

Rowse, ''Homosexuals in History'', New York: Carroll & Garf, 1977. p. 44</ref><ref>Jardine, Lisa; Stewart, Alan ''Hostage To Fortune: The Troubled Life of Francis Bacon'' Hill & Wang, 1999. p. 148</ref> Forker,<ref>Charles R. Forker, "'Masculine Love', Renaissance Writing, and the 'New Invention' of Homosexuality: An Addendum" in the ''Journal of Homosexuality'' (1996), Indiana University</ref> for example, has explored the "historically documentable sexual preferences" of both Francis Bacon and [[James VI and I|King James I]] and concluded they were both oriented to "masculine love", a contemporary term that "seems to have been used exclusively to refer to the sexual preference of men for members of their own gender."<ref>''Journal of Homosexuality'', Volume: 31 Issue: 3, 1996, pp. 85–93, {{ISSN|0091-8369}}</ref> Bacon's sexuality has been disputed by others, who point to lack of consistent evidence and consider the sources to be more open to interpretation.<ref name="Character Assassination" /><ref>Ross Jackson, ''The Companion to Shaker of the Speare: The Francis Bacon Story'', England: Book Guild Publishing, 2005. pp. 45–46</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">Bryan Bevan, ''The Real Francis Bacon'', England: Centaur Press, 1960</ref><ref>Helen Veale, ''Son of England'', India: Indo Polish Library, 1950</ref><ref>Peter Dawkins, ''Dedication to the Light'', England: Francis Bacon Research Trust, 1984</ref>

The Jacobean antiquary and Bacon's fellow parliament member Sir [[Simonds D'Ewes]] implied there had been a question of bringing Bacon to trial for buggery,<ref>Fulton Anderson, ''Francis Bacon: His career and his thought'', Los Angeles, 1962</ref> with which his brother Anthony Bacon had also been charged.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Golden Lads: A Study of Anthony Bacon, Francis and Their Friends|last = du Maurier|first = Daphne|publisher = Gollancz|year = 1975|isbn = 978-1-84408-073-1|location = London}}</ref> (Bacon's brother "apparently also was homosexual", according to literature and sexuality scholar Joseph Cady.){{sfn|Cady|1992|loc=14}} In his ''Autobiography and Correspondence'' diary entry for 3 May 1621, the date of Bacon's censure by Parliament, D'Ewes describes Bacon's love for his Welsh serving-men, in particular his servant Mr. Henry Godrick or Goodrick,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Robert.

In his ''[[Brief Lives]]'' sketches (likely composed during 1665–1690 and published as a book in 1813), the antiquary [[John Aubrey]] wrote that Bacon was a [[pederast]]{{sfn|Cady|1992|loc=14, 35n9}} "whose Ganimeds and Favourites tooke Bribes".<ref>Oliver Lawson Dick, ed. ''Aubrey's Brief Lives. Edited from the Original Manuscripts'', 1949, ''s.v.'' "Francis Bacon, Viscount of St. Albans" p. 11.</ref> While pederast strictly denoted "boy-lover" in earlier times, Cady wrote that Aubrey deployed the term discreetly in the original Greek to signify "male homosexual".{{sfn|Cady|1992|loc=14, 35n9}} The figure of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], he continued, was another of many common ways of referring obliquely to homosexuality.{{sfn|Cady|1992|loc=35n13}}

In ''[[New Atlantis]]'', Bacon described his [[utopian]] island as being "the chastest nation under heaven", with "no touch" of "masculine love".<ref name="Atlantis1627">Bacon, Francis. ''The New Atlantis''. 1627</ref> Cady argued that Bacon's reference to male homosexuality in the ''New Atlantis'' deliberately gave the appearance of coming from "outside the phenomenon" due to prevalent opposition.{{sfn|Cady|1992|loc=15}} It contrasted deliberately with "veiled" praise of the topic elsewhere in Bacon's work, he asserted.{{sfn|Cady|1992|loc=15}} Cady offered several examples, including that Bacon discussed only male beauty in his short essay "Of Beauty".{{sfn|Cady|1992|loc=15}} He also noted that Bacon ended his monologue ''The Masculine Birth of Time'' with an older man asking a younger one (from his "inmost heart") to "give yourself to me so that I may restore you to yourself" and "secure [you] an increase beyond all hopes and prayers of ordinary marriages".{{sfn|Cady|1992|loc=15}}

===Death===
[[File:20040912-001-francis-bacon.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Monument to Bacon at his burial place in [[St Michael's Church, St Albans|St Michael's Church]] in [[St Albans]]]]
On 9 April 1626, Bacon died of [[pneumonia]] at [[Highgate]] outside London, specifically at Arundel House, a country residence of his friend the [[Thomas Howard, 14th Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]],{{efn|Not to be confused with [[Arundel House|his central London residence of the same name]].}} though Arundel was then imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].<ref name="death">{{cite book|title=The Broadview Anthology of Seventeenth-Century Prose|year=2001|publisher=Broadview Press|page=18}}</ref> An influential account of the circumstances of his death was given by John Aubrey's ''Brief Lives''.<ref name="death" /> Aubrey's vivid account, which portrays Bacon as a martyr to experimental scientific method, has him journeying to High-gate through the snow with the King's physician when he is suddenly inspired by the possibility of using the snow to preserve meat:{{blockquote|They were resolved they would try the experiment presently. They alighted out of the coach and went into a poor woman's house at the bottom of Highgate hill, and bought a fowl, and made the woman [[wikt:exenterate|exenterate]] it.}}

After stuffing the fowl with snow, Bacon contracted a fatal case of pneumonia. Some people, including Aubrey, consider these two contiguous, possibly coincidental events as related and causative of his death:{{blockquote|The Snow so chilled him that he immediately fell so extremely ill, that he could not return to his Lodging ... but went to the Earle of Arundel's house at Highgate, where they put him into ... a damp bed that had not been layn-in ... which gave him such a cold that in 2 or 3 days as I remember Mr Hobbes told me, he died of Suffocation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowen|first1=Catherine|title=Francis Bacon: The Temper of a Man|url=https://archive.org/details/francisbacontem000bowe|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=Fordham University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/francisbacontem000bowe/page/225 225]}}</ref>}}Aubrey has been criticized for his evident credulousness in this and other works; on the other hand, he knew [[Thomas Hobbes]], Bacon's fellow-philosopher and friend.

Being unwittingly on his deathbed, the philosopher dictated his last letter to the Earl:{{blockquote|My very good Lord,—I was likely to have had the fortune of [[Pliny the Elder|Caius Plinius the elder]], who lost his life by trying an experiment about the burning of [[Mount Vesuvius]]; for I was also desirous to try an experiment or two touching the conservation and in-duration of bodies. As for the experiment itself, it succeeded excellently well; but in the journey between London and High-gate, I was taken with such a fit of [[Cough|casting]] as I know not whether it were the Stone, or some surfeit or cold, or indeed a touch of them all three. But when I came to your Lordship's House, I was not able to go back, and therefore was forced to take up my lodging here, where your housekeeper is very careful and diligent about me, which I assure myself your Lordship will not only pardon towards him, but think the better of him for it. For indeed your Lordship's House was happy to me, and I kiss your noble hands for the welcome which I am sure you give me to it.

Bacon's seminal work the ''[[Novum Organum]]'' was highly influential in the 17th century among scholars, in particular Sir [[Thomas Browne]], who in his encyclopedia ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' (1646–72) frequently adheres to a Baconian approach to his scientific enquiries. This book entails the basis of the scientific method as a means of observation and induction.  Also [[Robert Hooke]] was highly influenced by Bacon, using Baconian language and ideas in his book, "[[Micrographia]]."

According to Bacon, learning and knowledge all derive from inductive reasoning. Through his belief in experimentally-derived data, he theorised that all the knowledge that was necessary to fully understand a concept could be attained using induction.  "Induction" in this context can be thought of as "reasoning from evidence," as opposed to "deduction," or "top-down reasoning," which can be thought of as "reasoning from a pre-existing premise, or hypothesis." In order to get to the point of an inductive conclusion, one must consider the importance of observing the particulars (specific parts of nature). "Once these particulars have been gathered together, the interpretation of Nature proceeds by sorting them into a formal arrangement so that they may be presented to the understanding."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Henry S.|date=2013|title=Francis Bacon's Common Notion|journal=Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies|volume=13|issue=3|pages=7–32|doi=10.1353/jem.2013.0023|s2cid=153693271|issn=1553-3786}}</ref> Experimentation is essential to discovering the truths of Nature. When an experiment happens, the data is used to form a result and conclusion. Note that this process does not involve a pre-existing hypothesis. On the contrary, inductive reasoning starts with data, not a prior premise or hypothesis. Through this conclusion of particulars, an understanding of Nature can be formed. Now that an understanding of Nature has been arrived at, an inductive conclusion can be drawn. "There are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from these principles, the truth of which it takes for settled and immovable, proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms. And this way is now in fashion. The other derives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all. This is the true way, but as yet untried." (Bacon's axiom XIX from the Novum Organum) <ref>{{Cite book|last=Bacon|first=Francis|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/17510|title=Novum Organum|editor-last=Devey|editor-first=Joseph|date=1902|publisher=Collier|location=New York|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.17510}}</ref>

Bacon explains how we come to this understanding and knowledge because of this process in comprehending the complexities of nature. "Bacon sees nature as an extremely subtle complexity, which affords all the energy of the natural philosopher to disclose her secrets."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Christopher|date=1993|title=Daniel R.

"It is nothing less than a revival of Bacon's supremely confident belief that inductive methods can provide us with ultimate and infallible answers concerning the laws and nature of the universe."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nisbet|first=H.

Because of this, Bacon concludes that all learning and knowledge must be drawn from inductive reasoning.

During the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Bacon was commonly invoked as a guiding spirit of the [[Royal Society]] founded under Charles II in 1660.<ref>{{cite book |first=Julian |last=Martin |title=Francis Bacon: The State and the Reform of Natural Philosophy |year=1992 |place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-38249-6 }}{{Page needed|date=January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Byron |last=Steel |title=Sir Francis Bacon: The First Modern Mind |place=Garden City, NY |publisher=Doubleday, Doran & Co |year=1930 }}</ref> During the 18th-century [[French Enlightenment]], Bacon's non-metaphysical approach to science became more influential than the dualism of his French contemporary [[René Descartes|Descartes]], and was associated with criticism of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''.

One of his biographers, the historian [[William Hepworth Dixon]], states: "Bacon's influence in the modern world is so great that every man who rides in a train, sends a telegram, follows a [[steam plough]], sits in an easy chair, crosses the channel or the Atlantic, eats a good dinner, enjoys a beautiful garden, or undergoes a painless surgical operation, owes him something."<ref>{{cite book |last=Hepworth Dixon |first=William |title="The story of Lord Bacon's Life" (1862) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zd05AAAAcAAJ&pg=PP1|year=1862}}</ref>

In 1902 [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] published a fictional letter, known as ''[[The Lord Chandos Letter]]'', addressed to Bacon and dated 1603, about a writer who is experiencing a crisis of language.

===North America===
[[File:Lord Bacon - the guiding spirit of colonization scheme.jpg|thumb|upright=1|A [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] stamp, which reads: "Lord Bacon – the guiding spirit in colonization scheme"]]
Bacon played a leading role in establishing the [[British colonies in North America]], especially in [[Virginia]], [[the Carolinas]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in northeastern Canada. His government report on "The Virginia Colony" was submitted in 1609. In 1610 Bacon and his associates received a charter from the king to form ''the Tresurer and the Companye of Adventurers and planter of the Cittye of London and Bristoll for the Collonye or plantacon in Newfoundland'', and sent [[John Guy (governor)|John Guy]] to found a colony there.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/lab4/labvol4_1701.html |year=1701 |volume=4 |place=NF, [[Canada|CA]] |publisher=Heritage |title=Lab |type=law |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021163440/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/lab4/labvol4_1701.html |archive-date=21 October 2013 }}</ref> [[Thomas Jefferson]], the third President of the United States, wrote: "Bacon, [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].

In 1910, Newfoundland issued a postage stamp to commemorate Bacon's role in establishing the colony. The stamp describes Bacon as "the guiding spirit in Colonization Schemes in 1610".<ref name="Dodd-Life-Story" /> Moreover, some scholars believe he was largely responsible for the drafting, in 1609 and 1612, of two charters of government for the Virginia Colony.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-fb-life.html |type=essay |title=FB life |publisher=FBRT |place=UK |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131131208/http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-fb-life.html |archive-date=31 January 2012 }}</ref> William Hepworth Dixon considered that Bacon's name could be included in the list of Founders of the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hepworth Dixon |first=William |title=Personal History of Lord Bacon from Unpublished Papers |page=200 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BE4dalMQX-cC&pg=PA200 |isbn=978-0-7661-2798-2 |year= 2003 |publisher=Kessinger }}</ref>

===Law===
Although few of his proposals for law reform were adopted during his lifetime, Bacon's legal legacy was considered by the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in 1961 as having influenced the drafting of the [[Napoleonic Code]] as well as the law reforms introduced by 19th-century British Prime Minister [[Sir Robert Peel]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Crowther |first=J.

[[Harvey Wheeler]] attributed to Bacon, in ''Francis Bacon's Verulamium—the Common Law Template of The Modern in English Science and Culture'', the creation of these distinguishing features of the modern [[common law]] system:
* using cases as repositories of evidence about the "unwritten law";
* determining the relevance of precedents by exclusionary principles of evidence and logic;
* treating opposing legal briefs as adversarial hypotheses about the application of the "unwritten law" to a new set of facts.

As late as the 18th century, some juries still declared the law rather than the facts, but already before the end of the 17th century [[Sir Matthew Hale]] explained modern common law adjudication procedure and acknowledged Bacon as the inventor of the process of discovering unwritten laws from the evidences of their applications. The method combined empiricism and inductivism in a new way that was to imprint its signature on many of the distinctive features of modern [[English society]].<ref>Wheeler, Harvey. ''Francis Bacon's 'Verulamium': the Common Law Template of The Modern in English Science and Culture''</ref> [[Paul H. Kocher]] writes that Bacon is considered by some jurists to be the father of modern [[Jurisprudence]].<ref name="Jurisprudence">{{cite journal |last=Kocher |first=Paul |author-link=Paul H.

Bacon is commemorated with a statue in [[Gray's Inn]], South Square in London where he received his legal training, and where he was elected Treasurer of the Inn in 1608.<ref>[https://www.graysinn.org.uk/history/timeline/sir-francis-bacon "Sir Francis Bacon"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402172004/https://www.graysinn.org.uk/history/timeline/sir-francis-bacon |date=2 April 2016 }}. GraysInn.org. Retrieved 21 August 2015</ref>

More recent scholarship on Bacon's jurisprudence has focused on his advocating torture as a legal recourse for the crown.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hanson |first=Elizabeth |title=Torture and Truth in Renaissance England |journal=Representations |date=Spring 1991 |volume=34 |pages=53–84 |doi=10.1525/rep.1991.34.1.99p0046u |doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 }}</ref> Bacon himself was not a stranger to the torture chamber; in his various legal capacities in both Elizabeth I's and James I's reigns, Bacon was listed as a commissioner on five torture warrants. In 1613(?), in a letter addressed to King James I on the question of torture's place within English law, Bacon identifies the scope of torture as a means to further the investigation of threats to the state: "In the cases of treasons, torture is used for discovery, and not for evidence."<ref>{{cite book |last=Langbein |first=John H. |title=Torture and the Law of Proof |year=1976 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |page=90 }}</ref> For Bacon, torture was not a punitive measure, an intended form of state repression, but instead offered a modus operandi for the government agent tasked with uncovering acts of treason.

===Organization of knowledge===
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2023}}
Francis Bacon developed the idea that a classification of knowledge must be universal while handling all possible resources. In his progressive view, humanity would be better if access to educational resources were provided to the public, hence the need to organise it. His approach to learning reshaped the Western view of knowledge theory from an individual to a social interest.

The original classification proposed by Bacon organised all types of knowledge into three general groups: history, poetry, and philosophy. He did that based on his understanding of how information is processed: memory, imagination, and reason, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Simpson |first1=David |title=Francis Bacon (1561—1626) |url=https://iep.utm.edu/francis-bacon/ |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=22 December 2023 |quote=Bacon outlines his scheme for a new division of human knowledge into three primary categories: History, Poesy, and Philosophy (which he associates respectively with the three fundamental “faculties” of mind – memory, imagination, and reason).}}</ref> His methodical approach to the categorization of knowledge goes hand-in-hand with his principles of scientific methods. Bacon's writings were the starting point for [[William Torrey Harris]]'s [[Library classification system|classification system for libraries]] in the United States by the second half of the 1800s.

The phrase "{{lang|la|scientia potentia est}}" (or "{{lang|la|scientia est potentia}}"), meaning "[[knowledge is power]]", is commonly attributed to Bacon: the expression "{{lang|la|ipsa scientia potestas est}}" ("knowledge itself is power") occurs in his ''Meditationes Sacrae'' (1597).{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|pp=46–47}}

[[File:Bacon-Rose.jpg|thumb|upright=1|An old volume of Bacon and a rose]]
Francis Bacon often gathered with the men at Gray's Inn to discuss politics and philosophy, and to try out various theatrical scenes that he admitted writing.<ref>Frances Yates, ''Theatre of the World'', London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1969</ref> Bacon's alleged connection to the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]] and the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] has been widely discussed by authors and scholars in many books.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> However, others, including [[Daphne du Maurier]] in her biography of Bacon, have argued that there is no substantive evidence to support claims of involvement with the Rosicrucians.<ref>Daphne du Maurier, ''The Winding Stair, Biography of Bacon'' 1976.</ref> [[Frances Yates]]<ref>Frances Yates, ''The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age'', pp. 61–68, London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979</ref> does not make the claim that Bacon was a Rosicrucian, but presents evidence that he was nevertheless involved in some of the more closed intellectual movements of his day. She argues that Bacon's movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement, while Bacon's ''New Atlantis'' portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians. He apparently saw his own movement for the advancement of learning to be in conformity with Rosicrucian ideals.<ref name="Yates">Frances Yates, ''The Rosicrucian Enlightenment'', London and Boston: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1972</ref>

The link between Bacon's work and the Rosicrucians' ideals which Yates allegedly found was the conformity of the purposes expressed by the [[Rosicrucian Manifestos]] and Bacon's plan of a "[[Works by Francis Bacon#The Great Instauration|Great Instauration]]",<ref name="Yates" /> for the two were calling for a reformation of both "divine and human understanding",<ref group="lower-alpha">"Howbeit we know after a time there wil now be '''a general reformation, both of divine and humane things''', according to our desire, and the expectation of others: for it's fitting, that before the rising of the Sun, there should appear and break forth Aurora, or some clearness, or divine light in the sky" – ''[[Fama Fraternitatis]]'' ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/sro/rhr/rhr06.htm sacred-texts.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214062121/http://www.sacred-texts.com/sro/rhr/rhr06.htm |date=14 February 2012 }})</ref><ref>[[s:The Advancement of Learning|Bacon, Francis. Of the Proficience and Advancement of Learning, Divine and Human]]</ref> as well as both, had in view the purpose of mankind's return to the "state before the Fall".<ref group="lower-alpha">"Like good and faithful guardians, we may yield up their fortune to mankind upon the emancipation and majority of their understanding, from which must necessarily follow an improvement of their estate [...]. For man, by the fall, fell at the same time from his state of innocency and from his dominion over creation. Both of these losses however can even in this life be in some part repaired; the former by religion and faith, the latter by arts and sciences. – Francis Bacon, [[s:Novum Organum|Novum Organum]]</ref><ref group="lower-alpha">"We ought therefore here to observe well, and make it known unto everyone, that God hath certainly and most assuredly concluded to send and grant to the whole world before her end ... such a truth, light, life, and glory, as the first man Adam had, which he lost in Paradise, after which his successors were put and driven, with him, to misery. Wherefore there shall cease all servitude, falsehood, lies, and darkness, which by little and little, with the great world's revolution, was crept into all arts, works, and governments of men, and have darkened most part of them". – ''[[Confessio Fraternitatis]]''</ref>

Another major link is said to be the resemblance between Bacon's ''New Atlantis'' and the German Rosicrucian [[Johann Valentin Andreae]]'s ''Description of the Republic of Christianopolis'' (1619).{{sfn|Andreae|1619}} Andreae describes a utopic island in which Christian [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]] and applied science ruled, and in which the spiritual fulfilment and intellectual activity constituted the primary goals of each individual, the scientific pursuits being the highest intellectual calling—linked to the achievement of spiritual perfection. Andreae's island also depicts a great advancement in technology, with many industries separated in different zones which supplied the population's needs—which shows great resemblance to Bacon's scientific methods and purposes.<ref name="Farrington">{{cite book |last=Farrington |first=Benjamin |title=Francis Bacon, philosopher of industrial science |year=1951 |location = New York |isbn=978-0-374-92706-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Literary criticism of Johann Valentin Andreae |url=http://www.enotes.com/johann-valentin-andreae-criticism/andreae-johann-valentin |publisher=Enotes.com |access-date=21 October 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

While rejecting occult [[conspiracy theories]] surrounding Bacon and the claim Bacon personally identified as a Rosicrucian, intellectual historian Paolo Rossi has argued for an occult influence on Bacon's scientific and religious writing. He argues that Bacon was familiar with early modern [[Alchemy|alchemical]] texts and that Bacon's ideas about the application of science had roots in [[Renaissance magic]]al ideas about science and magic facilitating humanity's domination of nature.{{sfn|Rossi|1968|loc=Chapter 1}} Rossi further interprets Bacon's search for hidden meanings in myth and fables in such texts as ''The Wisdom of the Ancients'' as succeeding earlier occultist and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] attempts to locate hidden wisdom in pre-Christian myths.{{sfn|Rossi|1968|loc=Chapter 3}} As indicated by the title of his study, however, Rossi claims Bacon ultimately rejected the philosophical foundations of occultism as he came to develop a form of modern science.{{sfn|Rossi|1968|loc=Chapter 1}}

Rossi's analysis and claims have been extended by [[Jason Josephson-Storm]] in his study, ''The Myth of Disenchantment''. Josephson-Storm also rejects conspiracy theories surrounding Bacon and does not make the claim that Bacon was an active Rosicrucian. However, he argues that Bacon's "rejection" of magic actually constituted an attempt to purify magic of Catholic, demonic, and esoteric influences and to establish magic as a field of study and application paralleling Bacon's vision of science. Furthermore, Josephson-Storm argues that Bacon drew on magical ideas when developing his experimental method.{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=46}} Josephson-Storm finds evidence that Bacon considered nature a living entity, populated by spirits, and argues Bacon's views on the human domination and application of nature actually depend on his spiritualism and personification of nature.{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|pp=50–51}}

Bacon's influence can also be seen on a variety of religious and spiritual authors, and on groups that have utilized his writings in their own belief systems.<ref>Saint Germain Foundation.
