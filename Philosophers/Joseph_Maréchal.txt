'''Joseph Maréchal''', [[Society of Jesus|SJ]] ({{IPA|fr|maʁeʃal|lang}}; 1 July 1878 – 11 December 1944) was a Belgian [[Jesuit]] priest, philosopher, theologian and psychologist. He taught at the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy]] of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Leuven]] and was the founder of the school of thought called [[transcendental Thomism]], which attempted to merge the theological and philosophical thought of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] with that of [[Immanuel Kant]].

==Life and thought==
Maréchal joined the Jesuits in 1895 and after a doctorate in [[biology]] at Leuven (1905) he first specialized in [[experimental psychology]], spending some time in [[Munich]] with [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1911). Until the end of his life Maréchal would say that his real interest was more in psychology than in philosophy.

Prompted by the call of [[Pope Leo XIII]] to revitalize Thomist theology, he started studying in depth the works of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] in order to understand the inner coherence of his system, along with the works of other [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] thinkers, modern philosophers and scientists of the day. From this, and in particular from Kant's [[transcendental idealism]], emerged a new and more dynamic Thomism, recapturing the union of 'act and power' in Aquinas. The development of his thought can be grasped in the five ''cahiers'' (see bibliography) in which, after exposing the weaknesses of traditional Thomism, he evaluated Kant's philosophy (3rd cahier) with whose help he proposes a modernized Thomism in the 4th and 5th cahier. The work of Maréchal had a great influence on such contemporary theologians and philosophers as Andre Marc, Gaston Isaye, [[:fr:Joseph de Finance|Joseph de Finance]], [[Karl Rahner]], [[Bernard Lonergan]], [[:de:Johannes Baptist Lotz|Johannes Baptist Lotz]], [[Bernard O'Brien (Jesuit)|Bernard O'Brien]] and [[Richard De Smet]].

In the same way, he proceeded to study the psychology of the mystics. Until his death on 11 December 1944 he taught philosophy and experimental psychology at the Jesuit House of Studies in Leuven (St Albert of Leuven's Philosophical and Theological College). He was a great friend of [[Pierre Scheuer]], the Belgian Jesuit who has been described as a metaphysician and mystic.
