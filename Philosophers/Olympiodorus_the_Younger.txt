'''Olympiodorus the Younger''' ({{langx|el|Ὀλυμπιόδωρος ὁ Νεώτερος}}; born {{circa|495–505}}, died after 565)<ref>Dates in {{harvnb|Jackson|Lycos|Tarrant|1998|p=3}} and {{harvnb|Westerink|2011|p=xiii}}.</ref> was a [[Neoplatonist]] [[philosopher]], [[astrologer]] and teacher who lived in the early years of the [[Byzantine Empire]], after [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Justinian#Suppression of religions|Decree of 529 AD]] which closed Plato's [[Academy]] in Athens and other pagan schools.  Olympiodorus was the last [[Ancient Greek religion|pagan]] to maintain the [[Platonist]] tradition in [[Alexandria]] (see [[Alexandrian school|Alexandrian School]]); after his death the School passed into the hands of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Aristotelian view of God|Aristotelians]], and was eventually moved to [[Constantinople]]. He is not to be confused with [[Olympiodorus the Deacon]], a contemporary Alexandrian writer of Bible commentaries.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grillmeier |first1=Aloys |last2=Hainthaler |first2=Theresia |date=1996 |title=Christ in Christian Tradition: The Church in Alexandria, with Nubia and Ethiopia after 451 AD, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6FJGHacPKcC |location=London |publisher=[[A & C Black]] |page=105 |isbn=0264660188}}</ref>

==Life==
Olympiodorus was the disciple of [[Ammonius Hermiae]] at the philosophy school in Alexandria, and succeeded him as its leader when Ammonius died c. 520. He was still teaching and writing in 565, because in his commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s ''Meteorology'', he mentions a [[comet]] that appeared that year. Olympiodorus himself was able to survive the persecution experienced by many of his peers (see, for example, [[Hierocles of Alexandria]]), possibly because the Alexandrian School was less involved in politics (for example, the attempts by the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] to re-establish [[Mithraic]] cults) and also possibly because it was more scholastic and less religious than the Athenian Academy.

He is called "Olympiodorus the Younger" or "The Younger Olympiodorus" in contemporary references because there was an earlier (5th century) [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher also called Olympiodorus ([[Olympiodorus the Elder]]) who also taught in Alexandria.

==Writings==
Among the extant writings of Olympiodorus the Younger are a [[biography]] of [[Plato]], commentaries on several dialogues of Plato and on [[Aristotle]], and an introduction to Aristotelian philosophy.  Olympiodorus also provides information on the work of the earlier Neoplatonist [[Iamblichus]] which is not found elsewhere. The surviving works are:

*Commentary on Plato's ''Alcibiades'' (Σχόλια εἰς τὸν Πλάτωνος Ἀλκιβιάδην)
*Commentary on Plato's ''Gorgias'' (Σχόλια σὺν θεῷ εἰς τὸν Γοργίαν)<ref>Translated by {{harvnb|Jackson|Lycos|Tarrant|1998}}.</ref>
*Commentary on Plato's ''Phaedo'' (Σχόλια εἰς τὸν Πλάτωνος Φαίδωνα)
*Life of Plato (Βίος Πλάτωνος)
*Introduction (''Prolegomena'') to Aristotle's Logic (Εἰς τὰ προλεγόμενα τῆς Λογικῆς)
*Commentary on Aristotle's ''Meteorology'' (Εἰς τὸ πρῶτον τῶν Μετεωρολογικῶν Ἀριστοτέλους σχόλια)
*Commentary on Aristotle's ''Categories'' (Σχόλια εἰς τὰς Ἀριστοτέλους Κατηγορίας)
*Commentary on Aristotle's ''On Interpretation'' (Σχόλια εἰς τὸ Ἀριστοτέλους Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας)
*A polemical work against Strato.<ref name="CP Mason - a fellow of University College, London">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gx0QAAAAYAAJ&q=William+Smith+-++A+Dictionary+of+Greek+and+Roman+Biography+and+Mythology%2C+Volume+3|author=CP Mason - a fellow of University College, London|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, Volume 3|year=1873|publisher=J. Murray, 1873| access-date=2015-04-11}}</ref>

In addition, a ''Commentary'' by Olympiodorus is extant on [[Paulus Alexandrinus]]' ''Introduction'' to astrology (which was written in 378 AD).  Although the manuscript of the ''Commentary'' is credited in two later versions to a [[Heliodorus (philosopher)|Heliodorus]], L. G. Westerink argues that it is actually the outline of a series of lectures given by Olympiodorus in Alexandria between May and July 564 AD. The ''Commentary'' is an informative expatiation of Paulus' tersely written text, elaborating on practices and sources. The ''Commentary'' also illuminates the developments in astrological theory in the 200 years after Paulus.

In addition there are three works ascribed to Olympiodorus, but which are now believed to be by other authors:
* An [[alchemical]] treatise concerning [[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimus]]' ''On the Action'', called ''On the Book Kat'energian (On the action or According to the Action) by Zosimus and on the Sayings of Hermes and the Philosophers'' (Εἰς τὸ κατ' ἐνέργειαν Ζωσίμου, ὅσα ἀπὸ Ἑρμοῦ καὶ τῶν φιλοσόφων ἦσαν εἰρημένα)
* ''On the Divine and Sacred Art of the Philosophical Stone'' (Περί τῆς ἱερᾶς τέχνης τῆς φιλοσοφικῆς λίθου; [[Latin]]: ''De arte sacra lapidis philosophorum'')
* A commentary on Plato's ''[[Philebus]]'' — now thought to be the work of [[Damascius]]
