'''Karl Heim ''' (20 January 1874 – 30 August 1958) was a professor of [[dogmatics]] at [[Münster]] and [[Tübingen]]. He retired in 1939.<ref name=Saunders>{{cite book |author=Saunders, Nicholas |title=Divine action and modern science |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2002 |pages=101 |isbn=0-521-52416-4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xLJL_MBmUkQC&pg=PA94|access-date=2008-11-13}}</ref> His idea of [[God]] controlling [[quantum mechanics|quantum events]] that do and would seem otherwise random has been seen as the precursor to much of the current studies on divine action.<ref name=Saunders/>  His current influence upon religion and science theology has been compared in degree to that of the physicist and theologian [[Ian Barbour]] and of the scientist and theological organizer [[Ralph Wendell Burhoe]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Schwarz, Hans |title=Theology in a global context: the last two hundred years |publisher=W.B.

==Place amongst German scholars==
Until the late 1960s Karl Heim's call for a [[religion and science]] dialogue was a lone voice amongst German theologians. Within the realm of German scientists who were also Christian laity or religious proponents, Heim's views did however have contemporary company. So while German theologians [[Karl Barth]] and [[Rudolph Bultmann]] discouraged all types of [[interdisciplinary]] religious dialogue with science or any other intellectual discipline, scientists such as [[Max Planck]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Gunther Howe]], and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsacker]] readily participated in religion and science dialogues from the 1930s onward.<ref>[http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1990/PSCF3-90Haas.html "Science & Christian Faith in Western Europe: Personal View"]. J.W. Haas, Jr. ''[[PSCF]]''. 42 (March 1990): 39-44.</ref> In the 1960s Anglo-American [[Creationism]]-type  religion and science dialogues (in particular young earth) began to be promoted by [[A.E. Wilder-Smith]] and others involved in the Karl-Heim-[[Gesellschaft]] (i.e., the Karl Heim Society).<ref>[http://www.icr.org/article/german-creationist-movement/  "The German Creationist Movement"].

==Concept of spaces==
Heim's analog of spaces has been subject to some criticism.  He appeared to use a scientific concept to create a new natural-supernatural relationship using a [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]], which, in modern physics, cannot be visualized, and relates to mathematical and physical measurements and is always expressed as a mathematical equation.<ref name="Barbour"/> He proposed a "suprapolar" space which was experiential, interpersonal and non-objectifiable and would exist alongside conventional space-time within an "archetypal" space.  This space would be the abode of God, but also the experiencing subject connecting to God and other beings.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Heim, Karl (1874–1958) {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/heim-karl-1874-1958|access-date=2021-11-25|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref>
