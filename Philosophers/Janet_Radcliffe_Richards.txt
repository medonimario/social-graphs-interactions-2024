Her identification with feminism and her focus on bioethics both occurred "by accident"<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Stangroom |first=Jeremy |url=https://books.google.fr/books/about/What_Philosophers_Think.html?id=IElsQgAACAAJ |title=What Philosophers Think |date=2003-06-06 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-6180-3 |language=en}}</ref> during the writing of her first book, ''The Sceptical Feminist: A Philosophical Enquiry'' (Routledge, 1980; Penguin, 1982) – bioethics being central to the abortion debate.<ref name=":1" /> The book proved to be controversial within and without feminism, e.g. in regard to standards of rationality,<ref>[[Christine Battersby]], ''Recent work in feminist philosophy'', Philosophical Books 1991, 32:4, p. 200</ref> fashion and style, and her liberal stance.<ref>Imelda Whelehan, ''Modern feminist thought: from the second wave to "post-feminism"'', 1995, Edinburgh University Press, pp. 39–40</ref>

Her second book, ''Human Nature After Darwin: A Philosophical Introduction'' (Routledge, 2001) explores the so-called Darwin Wars, including what implications Darwinism raises for philosophy and the application of critical thinking to various arguments put forward in the debate.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2003 |title=Human Nature After Darwin by Janet Radcliffe Richards |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/40/Human_Nature_After_Darwin_by_Janet_Radcliffe_Richards |access-date=2021-03-16 |website=Philosophy Now}}</ref> It was originally written as an introduction to philosophical techniques for Open University students using the controversies relating to Darwinian thinking and human nature.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Macaro |first=Antonia |date=July 2001 |title=Book Reviews {{!}} Human Nature after Darwin |url=http://www.practical-philosophy.org.uk/Volume4Reviews/AfterDarwin.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815144216/http://www.practical-philosophy.org.uk/Volume4Reviews/AfterDarwin.htm |archive-date=2007-08-15 |website=Practical Philosophy}}</ref>
