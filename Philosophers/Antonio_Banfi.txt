'''Antonio Banfi''' (Vimercate, 30 September 1886 – Milano, 22 July 1957) was an Italian philosopher and [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|senator]]. He is also noted for founding the Italian philosophical school called [[critical rationalism]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Minazzi |first=Fabio |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXJnEAAAQBAJ&dq=antonio+banfi+dino+formaggio&pg=PA323 |title=Historical Epistemology and European Philosophy of Science: Rethinking Critical Rationalism and Transcendentalism |publisher=Springer Nature |year=2022 |isbn=978-3-030-96331-6 |location=Cham |pages=323 |language=en}}</ref>

Although influenced by the [[neo-Kantians]] in [[Marburg]] and [[Edmund Husserl]], whom he knew personally, Banfi moved away from [[idealism]] and instead focused on [[Marxism]], in particular [[historical materialism]]. Banfi joined the [[Italian Communist Party]] in 1947. He was elected to the Italian Senate in 1948 and again in 1953.

Banfi was a chair of the [[University of Milan]]'s History of Philosophy department.<ref name=":0">{{cite book | last=Di Giovanni | first=Piero | title=Le avanguardie della filosofia italiana nel XX. secolo | publisher=FrancoAngeli | publication-place=Milano | date=2002 | isbn=88-464-3693-8 | oclc=50261366 | language=it | page = 157}}</ref> Among his students were [[Dino Formaggio]] and [[Mario Dal Pra]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Tymieniecka |first=Anna-Teresa |title=Phenomenology World-Wide: Foundations — Expanding Dynamics — Life-Engagements A Guide for Research and Study |publisher=Springer |year=2014 |isbn=978-94-007-0472-5 |location=Dordrecht |pages=482 |language=en}}</ref>
