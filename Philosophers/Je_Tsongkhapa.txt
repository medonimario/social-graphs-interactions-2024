'''Tsongkhapa''' ([[Tibetan script|Tibetan]]: ཙོང་ཁ་པ་, {{IPA-bo|tsoŋˈkʰapa|}}'','' meaning: "the man from [[Xining|Tsongkha]]" or "the Man from Onion Valley",<ref name=vanSchaik>{{cite web|last1=van Schaik|first1=Sam|title=Amdo Notes III: Gold and turquoise temples|url=http://earlytibet.com/2010/08/25/amdo-notes-iii//|website=early Tibet|date=25 August 2010|access-date=11 November 2014}}</ref> c. 1357–1419) was an influential [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] Buddhist [[Buddhist monasticism|monk]], [[philosopher]] and [[Tantra|tantric]] [[yogi]], whose activities led to the formation of the [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]<ref name="TK2006">Tsong khapa (2006), pp. ix-x.</ref> as a synthesis of the earlier [[Kadampa]] school lineages. He was the teacher of the [[1st Dalai Lama]].

His philosophical works are a grand synthesis of the [[Buddhist logico-epistemology|Buddhist epistemological]] tradition of [[Dignāga]] and [[Dharmakirti|Dharmakīrti]], the [[Cittamatra]] philosophy of the mind, and the [[madhyamaka]] philosophy of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] and [[Chandrakirti|Candrakīrti]].<ref name="TK2">Tsong khapa (2006), pp. ix-xii.</ref><ref name=":3">Sparham, Gareth, [https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/tsongkhapa/ "Tsongkhapa"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).</ref>

Central to his philosophical and soteriological teachings is "a radical view of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]]" which sees all phenomena as devoid of [[Svabhava|intrinsic nature]].<ref name="Newland 2009, p. 8">Newland 2009, p. 8.</ref> This view of emptiness is not a kind of [[nihilism]] or a total denial of existence. Instead, it sees phenomena as existing "[[Pratītyasamutpāda|interdependently]], [[Relationalism|relationally]], non-[[Essentialism|essentially]], [[Conventionalism|conventionally]]" (which Tsongkhapa terms "mere existence").<ref>Garfield, Jay (2014), “Madhyamaka is Not Nihilism”, in Jeeloo Liu and Douglas L. Berger (eds.), ''Nothingness in Asian Philosophy'' (New York: Routledge), 44-54.</ref>

Tsongkhapa emphasized the importance of philosophical reasoning in the path to liberation. According to Tsongkhapa, meditation must be paired with rigorous reasoning in order "to push the mind and precipitate a breakthrough in cognitive fluency and insight."<ref name="PatrickJennings" />

==Biography==
[[File:Tsongkapa - Google Art Project (CgHazyKs8STBow).jpg|thumb|250px|Painting depicting the life of Tsongkhapa, the largest image on the left showing the dream he had of the great Indian scholars like [[Buddhapalita]]]]

=== Early years and studies ===
With a [[Mongols|Mongolian]] father and a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] mother, Tsongkhapa was born into a [[nomad]]ic family in the walled city of Tsongkha in [[Amdo]], [[Tibet]] (present-day [[Haidong]] and [[Xining]], [[Qinghai]]) in 1357.<ref name="TK2" /><ref name=":3" /> Tsongkhapa was educated in Buddhism from an early age by his first teacher, the [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] monk Choje Dondrub Rinchen. Tsongkhapa became a [[Samanera|novice monk]] at the age of six.<ref>Jinpa 2019, pp. 23-25.</ref>

When he was sixteen, Tsongkhapa traveled to [[Ü-Tsang|Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang)]], where he studied at the scholastic institutions of the Sangphu monastery, the [[Drikung Kagyu]] and the [[Sakya (Tibetan Buddhist school)|Sakya]] tradition of [[Sakya Pandita|Sakya paṇḍita]] (1182–1251).<ref name=":3" /><ref>Jinpa 2019, pp. 27-32.</ref> At the Drikung Thil Monastery he studied under Chenga Chokyi Gyalpo, the great patriarch of [[Drikung Kagyu]], and received teachings on numerous topics like [[Mahamudra]] and the [[Six Dharmas of Naropa]].<ref name="CM6" /><ref>Jinpa 2019, p. 32.</ref> Tsongkhapa also studied [[Traditional Tibetan medicine|Tibetan medicine]], followed by all major Buddhist scholastic subjects including [[abhidharma]], ethics, epistemology (Sk. ''[[Pramana|pramāṇa]]''), [[Vajrayana]] and various lineages of [[Vajrayana|Buddhist tantra]].<ref name="TK2" />

Tsongkhapa studied widely under numerous teachers from various Tibetan Buddhist traditions.<ref name="CM6">Crystal Mirror VI : 1971, Dharma Publishing, page 464, 0-913546-59-3</ref> His main teachers include: the Sakya masters Rendawa and Rinchen Dorje, the Kagyu master Chenga Rinpoche and the [[Jonang]] masters Bodong Chakleh Namgyal, Khyungpo Hlehpa and Chokyi Pelpa.<ref name="TK2006" /> Tsongkhapa also received the three main Kadampa lineages. He received the Lam-Rim lineage, the oral guideline lineage from the Nyingma Lama, Lhodrag Namka-gyeltsen, and lineage of textual transmission from Lama Umapa.<ref name="Berzin1">{{Cite web|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|author-link=Alexander Berzin (scholar)|date=December 2003|title=The Life of Tsongkhapa|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/spiritual-teachers/tsongkhapa/the-life-of-tsongkhapa|access-date=2016-06-06|website=Study Buddhism}}</ref>

Rendawa Zhönnu Lodrö was Tsongkhapa's most important teacher.<ref>Jinpa 2019, p. 41.</ref> Under Rendawa, Tsongkhapa studied various classic works, including the ''[[Pramanavarttika]]'', the ''[[Abhidharmakosha]]'', the ''[[Abhidharma-samuccaya|Abhidharmasamuccaya]]'' and the ''[[Madhyamakāvatāra|Madhyamakavatara]]''.<ref name="CM6" /><ref>Jinpa 2019, pp. 41-45.</ref> Tsongkhapa also studied with a [[Nyingma]] teacher, Drupchen Lekyi Dorje ({{bo|w=grub chen las kyi rdo je}}), also known as Namkha Gyaltsen ({{bo|w=nam mkha' rgyal mtshan}}, 1326–1401).<ref>''The Life of Shabkar: The Autobiography of a Tibetan yogin'' by Źabs-dkar Tshogs-drug-raṅ-grol, Matthieu Ricard.

During his early years, Tsongkhapa also composed a few original works, including the ''Golden Garland'' ({{bo|w=legs bshad gser phreng}}), a commentary on the ''[[Abhisamayalankara|Abhisamayālaṃkāra]]'' from the perspective of the Yogācāra-svātantrika-madhyamaka tradition of [[Śāntarakṣita]] which also attempts to refute the [[Rangtong-Shentong|shentong]] views of [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|Dolpopa]] (1292–1361).<ref name=":3" /><ref name="Ngawang_Samten">Ngawang Samten/Garfield.

=== Retreats and visions of Mañjuśrī ===
[[file:MET_31_128_1_86148.jpg|thumb|250px|A depiction of Tsongkhapa communing with [[Manjushri|Mañjuśrī]] bodhisattva]]
From 1390 to 1398, Tsongkhapa engaged in extended meditation retreats with a small group of attendants in various locations, the most well known of which is in the Wölkha Valley.<ref name=":4">Tsong khapa (2006), p. xi.</ref><ref>Jinpa 2019, pp. 117-137.</ref> He also developed a close relationship with a mystic and hermit named Umapa Pawo Dorje, known for his connection to [[Manjushri|Mañjuśrī]] bodhisattva and his frequent visions of black Mañjuśrī, with whom he would communicate. Umapa acted as a [[Mediumship|medium]] for Tsongkhapa, who eventually began having his own visions of Mañjuśrī.<ref>Jinpa 2019, pp. 77, 87, 103-107.</ref>

During this period of extensive meditation retreat, Tsongkhapa had numerous visions of guru Mañjuśrī (''Jamyang Lama''). During these visions he would receive teachings from the bodhisattva and ask questions about the right view of emptiness and Buddhist practice. An important instruction Tsongkhapa is said to have received about the view from Mañjuśrī is: <blockquote>"It is inappropriate to be partial either to emptiness or to appearance. In particular, you need to take the appearance aspect seriously."<ref name=":8">Jinpa 2019, pp. 103-107.</ref> </blockquote>Tsongkhapa would also discuss these visions and instructions with his teacher Rendawa (and some record of this correspondence has survived). During this period, Tsongkhapa is also said to have received a series of oral transmissions from Mañjuśrī. These later came to be called the Mañjuśrī cycle of teachings.<ref name=":8" />

In 1397, while in intensive meditation retreat at Wölkha Valley, Tsongkhapa writes that he had a “major insight” (''ngeshé chenpo'') into the view of emptiness.<ref name=":9">Jinpa 2019, pp. 157-187</ref> Initially, Tsongkhapa had a dream of the great madhyamaka masters: Nagarjuna, [[Buddhapālita|Buddhapalita]], [[Aryadeva]], and [[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]]. In this dream, Buddhapālita placed a wrapped text on the top of Tsongkhapa's head. After waking from this dream, Tsongkhapa began to study Buddhapālita's commentary to Nagarjuna's Middle Way Verses. As he was reading chapter 18, his understanding became crystal clear and all his doubts vanished.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":9" /> According to Thupten Jinpa, "at the heart of Tsongkhapa’s breakthrough experience was a profound realization of the equation of emptiness and dependent origination." He then spent the next spring and summer in deep meditation, experiencing great bliss, devotion, and gratitude to the Buddha.<ref name=":9" />

=== Mature Period ===
[[file:Ganden.jpg|thumb|250px|Ganden Monastery, Tibet]]
In the later period of Tsongkhapa's life, he composed a series of works on Buddhist philosophy and practice. His most famous work is the ''Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path'' (''Lam rim chen mo,'' c. 1402).<ref name=":3" /> This ''[[lamrim]]'' ('stages of the path') text outlines the Mahayana path to enlightenment and also presents Tsongkhapa's view of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and the [[Middle Way|middle way]] view (Madhyamaka). In 1405, he finished his ''Great Exposition of Tantra'' (''Sngags rim chen mo'').<ref name=":3" />

Tsongkhapa also wrote other major works during this period, including ''Essence of Eloquence'' (''Legs bshad snying po''), ''Ocean of Reasoning'' (''Rigs pa'i rgya mtsho,'' a commentary on Nagarjuna's classic ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''), the ''Medium-Length Lamrim'', and ''Elucidation of the Intent'' (''dGongs pa rab gsal''), his last major writing.<ref name=":3" />

According to Garfield:<ref name=":4" /><blockquote>the major philosophical texts composed in the remaining twenty years of his life develop with great precision and sophistication the view he developed during this long retreat period and reflect his realization that while Madhyamaka philosophy involves a relentlessly negative dialectic — a sustained critique both of reification and of nihilism and a rejection of all concepts of essence—the other side of that dialectic is an affirmation of conventional reality, of dependent origination, and of the identity of the two truths, suggesting a positive view of the nature of reality as well.</blockquote>

In 1409, Tsongkhapa worked on a project to renovate the [[Jokhang]] Temple, the main temple in [[Lhasa]]. He also established a 15-day prayer festival, known as the Great Prayer Festival, at Jokhang to celebrate [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni Buddha]].<ref name=":3" /><ref>Jinpa 2019, pp. 237-257.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=IUM, Michael |date=2022 |title=Tsongkhapa as a mahāsiddha |url=https://doi.org/10.2143/JIABS.45.0.3291577 |journal=Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies |volume=45  |pages=73–117 |doi=10.2143/JIABS.45.0.3291577 |issn=2507-0347}}</ref> In 1409, Tsongkhapa also worked to found [[Ganden Monastery|Ganden monastery]], located 25 miles north of [[Lhasa]].<ref>Dowman, Keith (1988). ''The Power-places of Central Tibet: The Pilgrim's Guide'', p. 103. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul; ISBN 0-7102-1370-0</ref> Two of his students, Tashi Palden (1379–1449) and Shakya Yeshey (1354–1435) respectively founded [[Drepung Monastery|Drepung monastery]] (1416), and [[Sera Monastery]] (1419). Together with Ganden, these three would later become the most influential ''Gelug'' monasteries in Tibet and also the largest monasteries in the world. These institutions became the center of a new growing school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Ganden or Gelug sect.<ref name=":3" />

=== Death and legacy ===
[[Image:Beijing-Lamakloster Yonghe-78-Halle des Dharmarads-Tsongkhapa-gje.jpg|thumb|250px|Statue of Tsongkhapa at [[Yonghe Temple]], [[Beijing]]]]
In 1419, Tsongkhapa died at the age of 62 in [[Ganden Monastery]]. At the time of his death, he was a well-known figure in Tibet with a large following.<ref name=":22">Jinpa 2019, pp. 329-365.</ref> Jinpa notes that various sources from other Tibetan Buddhist schools, like Pawo Tsuklak Trengwa and [[Sakya Chokden|Shākya Chokden]], both write about how large numbers of Tibetans flocked to Tsongkhapa's new Gelug tradition during the 15th century.<ref name=":22"/> Tsongkhapa's three principal disciples were [[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama|Khedrup Gelek Palsang]], [[Gyaltsab Je|Gyaltsap Darma Rinchen]], and Dülzin Drakpa Gyaltsen.<ref name=":11">Jinpa 2019, p 365.</ref> According to Jinpa, other important students of Tsongkhapa were "Tokden Jampel Gyatso; Jamyang Chöjé and Jamchen Chöjé, the founders of Drepung and Sera monasteries, respectively; and the [[1st Dalai Lama|First Dalai Lama]], Gendün Drup."<ref name=":11" />

After Tsongkhapa's death, his disciples worked to spread his teachings and the Gelug school grew rapidly across the [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibetan plateau]], founding or converting numerous monasteries.<ref name=":22"/> The new Gelug tradition saw itself as a descendant of the Kadam school and emphasized monastic discipline and rigorous study of the Buddhist classics.<ref name=":19">Jamgon Mipham, Padmakara Translation Group (2017). ''The Wisdom Chapter: Jamgön Mipham's Commentary on the Ninth Chapter of The Way of the Bodhisattva.'' p. 30. Shambhala Publications.</ref> According to Jinpa, by the end of the fifteenth century, the "new Ganden tradition had spread through the entire [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibetan cultural area]], with monasteries upholding the tradition located in [[western Tibet]], in [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]], in central and southern Tibet, and in [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]] in the east."<ref name=":22"/>

After his death, Tsongkhapa's works were also published in woodblock prints, making them much more accessible.<ref name=":22"/> Several biographies and [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] of Tsongkhapa were also written by Lamas of different traditions.<ref name="rth">{{harvnb|Thurman|2009|p=34}}</ref> Tsongkhapa was also held in high regard by key figures of other Tibetan Buddhist traditions. [[Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama|Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa]], in a poem called ''In Praise of the Incomparable Tsong Khapa,'' calls Tsongkhapa "the reformer of Buddha’s doctrine", "the great charioteer of Madhyamaka philosophy in Tibet", "supreme among those who propound emptiness", and "one who had helped spread robe-wearing monastics across Tibet and from China to Kashmir".{{sfn|Thurman|2009|p=243}}<ref name=":22"/> [[Wangchuk Dorje, 9th Karmapa Lama]], praised Tsongkhapa as one "who swept away wrong views with the correct and perfect ones".<ref name="rth" />

Tsongkhapa's works and teachings became central for the Ganden or [[Gelug]] school, where he is seen as a major authoritative figure.<ref>Cozort/Preston : 2003, Buddhist Philosophy, page VIII-IX</ref> Their interpretation and exegesis became a major focus of Gelug scholasticism. They were also very influential on later Tibetan philosophers, who would either defend or criticize Tsongkhapa's views on numerous points.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":22"/>

Tsongkhapa's madhyamaka thought has become widely influential in the western scholarly understanding of madhyamaka, with the majority of books and articles (beginning in the 1980s) initially being based on Gelug explanations.<ref>{{harvnb|Brunnhölzl|2004|p=17}}</ref><ref name=":20">Jamgon Mipham, Padmakara Translation Group (2017). ''The Wisdom Chapter: Jamgön Mipham's Commentary on the Ninth Chapter of The Way of the Bodhisattva.'' p. 31. Shambhala Publications.</ref>

=== Hagiography ===
After his death, Tsongkhapa came to be seen as a second Buddha in the Gelug tradition. Numerous [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] were written by Gelug figures such as Khedrup Je and Tokden Jampel Gyatso. These texts developed the great myths of Tsongkhapa, included stories of his previous births. Over time, an extensive collection of myths and stories about Tsongkhapa accumulated.<ref name=":102">Jinpa, Thupten (2019). ''Tsongkhapa: A Buddha in the Land of Snows''. Boulder, CO: Shambhala Publications. pp. 329-365;  ISBN 9781611806465</ref>

According to these myths, Tsongkhapa had been a student of Mañjuśrī for numerous past lives. In a former life, he aspired to spread Vajrayāna and the perfect view of emptiness in front of the Buddha Indraketu. Tsongkhapa then received a prophecy from numerous Buddhas which said that he would become the tathāgata Siṁhasvara (Lion's Roar). Another story recounts that during Śākyamuni's life, Tsongkhapa, in the form of a Brahmin boy, offered the Buddha a crystal rosary and generated [[bodhicitta]]. The Buddha prophesied that the boy would one day be the reviver of the Buddha's doctrine. Hagiographies such as Khedrup Je's also depict how Tsongkhapa achieved full Buddhahood after his death.<ref name=":102" /> Some hagiographical sources also claim that Tsongkhapa was an emanation of Mañjuśrī as well as a reincarnation of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]], [[Atiśa]] and [[Padmasambhāva|Padmasambhava]].<ref name=":102" />

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Prasaṅgika according to Tsongkhapa|Prasangika}}
[[File:Tsongkapa, thangka from Tibet in the 15th-century, painting on cloth - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Tsongkapa, 15th-century painting, [[Rubin Museum of Art]] ]]

Tsongkhapa's philosophy is mainly based on that of Indian [[madhyamaka]] philosophers like [[Nagarjuna]], [[Buddhapālita|Buddhapalita]] and [[Chandrakirti]]. Tsongkhapa also draws on the epistemological tradition of [[Dharmakirti]] in his explanation of [[Two truths doctrine|conventional truth]]. According to [[Jay L. Garfield|Jay Garfield]], Tsongkhapa's philosophy is based on the idea that "a complete understanding of [[Buddhist philosophy]] requires a synthesis of the epistemology and logic of Dharmakirti with the metaphysics of Nagarjuna."<ref name="Ngawang_Samten" /> According to Thomas Doctor, Tsongkhapa's madhyamaka views were also influenced by the 12th-century [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] school madhyamaka [[Mabja Changchub Tsöndrü]] (d. 1185).<ref name="Doctor2">[http://about.tbrc.org/rare-tibetan-texts-05-new-sources-for-madhyamaka/ Thomas Doctor, ''Exploring the Stuff that Madhyamaka Hermeneutics are Made of: A Note on a Clear Predecessor to Tsongkhapa's Prasangika/Svatantrika Distinction''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324104523/http://about.tbrc.org/rare-tibetan-texts-05-new-sources-for-madhyamaka/|date=2015-03-24}}</ref>

Tsongkhapa is also known for his emphasis on the importance of philosophical reasoning on the path to liberation. According to Tsongkhapa, meditation must be paired with rigorous reasoning in order "to push the mind and precipitate a breakthrough in cognitive fluency and insight."<ref name="PatrickJennings" />

According to [[Thupten Jinpa]], Tsongkhapa's thought was concerned with three main misinterpretations of madhyamaka philosophy in Tibet:<ref>Thupten Jinpa. ''Tsongkhapa's Qualms about Early Tibetan Interpretations of Madhyamaka Philosophy.'' Vol. 24, No. 2 (Summer 1999), pp. 3-28.</ref>

* a [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] or overly [[Scepticism (philosophy)|skeptical]] reading of the prasangika-madhyamaka which denigrates or undermines the everyday world of experience and the validity of [[epistemology]] ([[Patsab Nyima Drakpa|Patsab]] is one figure who Tsongkhapa sees as associated with this view).
* the so-called "[[shentong]] madhyamaka" view of the [[Jonang]] school and its founder [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|Dolpopa]], which Tsongkhapa sees as absolutist and essentialist.
* a view which held that conceptual analysis and correct views were unnecessary and that what mattered was to get rid of all thought or to get rid of all concepts or to just remain in single pointed concentration (as thoughts arise and pass). Tsongkhapa saw these ideas as being associated with the [[Chan Buddhism|Chinese Chan]] figure of [[Moheyan|Heshang]] and some Tibetan Buddhists. He held that these [[Quietism (philosophy)|quietist]] views (which reject study and conceptual analysis) were [[Soteriology|soteriological]] dead-ends and could have negative ethical consequences.

According to [[Thupten Jinpa]], one of Tsongkhapa's main concerns was "to delineate the parameters of Madhyamaka reasoning in such a way that Madhyamaka dialectics cannot be seen to negate the objects of everyday experience and, more importantly, ethics and religious activity" or as Tsongkhapa put it, one must "correctly identify the object of negation" (which is ''[[svabhava]]'').<ref name="Thupten37">[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way,'' pp. 37-38. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref>{{refn|group=note|According to Thupten Jinpa " the following elements appear to be key to his [Tsongkhapa's] strategy in delineating the parameters of negation."
* distinguishing between the domains of conventional and ultimate discourses
* distinguishing between the two senses of 'ultimate' in the context of Madhyamaka dialectics
* identifying the object of negation prior to the application of Madhyamaka dialectics
* distinguishing between that which is 'negated' and that which is 'not found'; and
* understanding correctly the logical form of the negation involved in these dialectics.<ref name="Thupten37" />}} Tsongkhapa held that if one did not properly understand what is to be negated in madhyamaka, one was at risk of either negating too much (nihilism) or negating too little (essentialism), and thus one would "miss the mark" of madhyamaka.<ref name="Self p. 49">[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way,'' p. 49. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref> According to Jinpa, the correct object of negation for Tsongkhapa is "our innate apprehension of self-existence" which refers to how even our normal ways of perceiving the world "are effected by a belief in some kind of intrinsic existence of things and events".<ref name="Self p. 49"/> Jinpa also writes that the second major aspect of Tsongkhapa's philosophical project "entails developing a systematic theory of reality in the aftermath of an absolute rejection of intrinsic existence".<ref name="Thupten37" />

=== View of ultimate truth and emptiness ===
Tsongkhapa follows Nagarjuna and Candrakirti in asserting that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence or essence (''[[svabhava]]'') because they are dependently originated.<!-- **START OF NOTE** -->{{refn|group=note|According to Jay Garfield, "[a] fundamental tenet of any Buddhist school is that all phenomena are dependently originated. In Madhyamaka Buddhist thought, following Candrakrti [...], this dependency is glossed in three ways":<ref>Jay Garfield (2013), ''Just Another Word for Nothing Left to Lose: Freedom, Agency and Ethics for Mādhyamikas'', pp. 9-10</ref>

Furthermore, according to Tsongkhapa, emptiness is itself empty of inherent existence and thus only exists nominally and conventionally as dependent arising.{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=191}}<ref name="Newland 2009, p. 58">Newland 2009, p. 58.</ref> There is thus no "transcendental ground," and "ultimate reality" that has an existence of its own.

In his works, Tsongkhapa takes pains to refute an alternative interpretation of emptiness which was promoted by the Tibetan philosopher [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]] (1292–1361). This view (called [[Rangtong-Shentong|''shentong'']], "empty of other") held that ultimate reality is not a non-affirming negation, and that it is only empty of conventional things and is not empty of itself. This view thus holds that ultimate reality has a kind of true existence as the ultimate and absolute ground of reality.<ref>Stearns, Cyrus (1999), ''The Buddha from Dolpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen'', p. 82.

=== The existence of the conventional ===
Tsongkhapa's prāsaṅgika madhyamaka affirms the "mere existence" of dependent phenomena on the conventional level. As such, Tsongkhapa argues that conventional truths are true because there is a sense in which they ''exist'' (Tib. ''yod pa'') in some real sense.<ref name=":7">Newland, Guy Martin. ''Weighing the Butter, Levels of Explanation, and Falsification: Models of the Conventional in Tsongkhapa's Account of Madhyamaka'' in Cowherds (2010).</ref> For Tsongkhapa, this conventional existence means that phenomena (i.e. dharmas) ''only'' come into existence in a dependent and contingent way, which includes the fact that they arise co-dependently with the minds that perceive them and conceptually impute their existence.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|Berzin|1997|p=101}} In this view, things ''do exist'' in a conventional and nominal sense as conceptual imputations (''rtog pas btags tsam'') which are dependent upon a relationship with a knowing and designating mind. However, all phenomena still lack existence in an independent, self-arising, or self-sustaining manner.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tsongkhapa|title=Lamrim Chenmo|pages=155-157, deeper reading 155-194}}</ref><ref name=":7" /> That is to say, when one searches for the ultimate nature of any thing, "what the thing really is", nothing can be found under this "ultimate analysis" and thus nothing can withstand ultimate analysis. Unlike other Tibetan madhyamikas, Tsongkhapa argues that this does not mean things do not exist at all or that ultimate analysis undermines conventional existence. Thus for Tsongkhapa, the conventional really is a kind of ''truth'', a way of being real.<ref>Newland 2009, p. 31.</ref><ref name=":1">Garfield, Jay L. ''Taking Conventional Truth Seriously: Authority regarding Deceptive Reality'' in Cowherds (2010).</ref>

Tsongkhapa cites numerous passages from Nagarjuna which show that [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] (the lack of intrinsic nature) and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]] (the fact that all dharmas arise based on causes and conditions) ultimately have the same intent and meaning and thus they are two ways of discussing one single reality.<ref>Newland 2009, p. 32.</ref> Tsongkhapa also cites various passages from Chandrakirti to show that even though phenomena do not arise intrinsically, they do arise conventionally. Chandrakirti is quoted by Tsongkhapa as stating "even though all things are empty, from those empty things effects are definitely produced", "because things are not produced causelessly, or from causes such as a divine creator, or from themselves, or from both self and other, they are produced dependently", and "we contend that dependently produced things are, like reflections, not produced intrinsically."<ref>Newland 2009, pp. 37, 53-54.</ref>

He also cites a passage from Chandrakirti's commentary to [[Aryadeva|Aryadeva's]] ''Four Hundred'' which states: <blockquote>"Our analysis focuses only on those who search for the intrinsically real referent. What we are refuting here is that things [and events] are established by means of their own-being. We do not [however] negate [the existence of] eyes and so on, which are [causally] conditioned and are dependently originated in that they are the fruits of karma."<ref>[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way,'' p. 45. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref> </blockquote>In this way, Tsongkhapa argues that the madhyamaka idea that dharmas do not arise or are not found is to be qualified as meaning that they do not arise intrinsically or essentially. He also cites the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' where the Buddha says, "Mahamati, thinking that they are not produced intrinsically, I said that all phenomena are not produced".<ref>Newland 2009, p. 54.</ref>

Because of this, Tsongkhapa holds that while conventional phenomena cannot withstand ultimate analysis (which searches for the true or ultimate nature of anything and is unable to find anything intrinsically), this does not mean that conventional phenomena are invalidated, undermined or negated by this ultimate analysis, since they still exist as dependent arisings.<ref>Newland 2009, p. 40.</ref> Indeed, for Tsongkhapa, it is ''because'' things are ultimately empty that they can be said to arise and exist at all. Some Tibetan madhyamikas hold that conventional truths are merely the relative conventions of simple everyday people, but that these conventions do not exist for advanced meditators or madhyamika philosophers. Tsongkhapa rejects this as "a great philosophical error" and affirms the pragmatic importance of conventional truths.<ref>Newland 2009, p. 43.</ref><ref name=":1" /> For Tsongkhapa, the rejection of the dependent reality of the conventional undermines the very possibility of truth and falsehood, and of any epistemic authority and thus, it undermines all Buddhist teachings regarding bondage and liberation as well as undermining itself as a cogent argument.<ref name=":1" /> However, like Candrakīrti, Tsonkghapa also accepts that while conventional truths are truths, they also can obscure or veil the ultimate (since for most people, these truths appear as intrinsically true). This is like how a [[mirage]] is a real phenomenon, but can also be deceptive (since it appears to be what it is not)<ref name=":1" />

Tsongkhapa also argues that ultimate analysis is not merely a philosophical or intellectual matter, instead it is supposed to negate a deep internal habit that sentient beings have which experiences the world in a false and distorted way. This superimposition is a "pervasive sense that things are real and solid and exist just as they appear" which we have become habituated and addicted to for countless lifetimes. This addiction is what is to be refuted and abandoned. It is ''not'' the idea of "intrinsic existence" as a philosophical concept (equivalent to a non-existent rabbit's horn and thus trivial).<ref>Newland 2009, p. 44, 57.</ref> Another way of saying this is that for Tsongkhapa, the most subtle object of negation is the perception that phenomena have "their own way of existing without being posited through the force of consciousness".<ref>Newland 2009, p. 70.</ref> It is an ongoing mental process of imputing objectively independent reality and intrinsic existence to what is perceived.<ref>Newland 2009, pp. 70-71.</ref>

Tsongkhapa's view that a dependent and conventional reality is not negated by madhyamaka (and that it is just intrinsic nature that is negated) was a subject of much debate among Tibetan madhyamaka philosophers and became a subject of critique for [[Sakya (Tibetan Buddhist school)|Sakya]] school figures like [[Gorampa|Gorampa Sonam Senge]] (1429-1489).<ref name=":13">Garfield, Jay L.; Thakchoe, Sonam. ''Identifying the Object of Negation and the Status of Conventional Truth: Why the dGag Bya Matters So Much to Tibetan Madhyamikas in'' Cowherds (2010).</ref> Sakya philosophers like Gorampa and his supporters held that madhyamaka analysis rejects ''all'' conventional phenomena (which he calls "false appearances" and sees as conceptually produced) and so, tables and persons are no more real than dreams or [[Santa Claus]].<ref name=":13" /> Thus, for Gorampa (contra Tsongkhapa), conventional truth is "entirely false", "unreal", "a kind of nonexistence" and "truth only from the perspective of fools."<ref name=":13" /> But for Tsongkhapa, the two truths (conventional and ultimate) are two facts about the same reality, or "two aspects of one and the same world" according to Thupten Jinpa.<ref name=":21">[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way,'' p. 158. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref> Thus for Tsongkhapa, to totally negate conventional truth (at the level of ultimate truth) would be to negate dependent origination (and so, it is to negate emptiness, the ultimate truth itself). Tsongkhapa sees this as a kind of nihilism.<ref name=":13" /><ref name=":21" />

=== Epistemology ===
Tsongkhapa held that a proper defense of madhyamaka required an understanding of [[Pramana|pramāṇa]] ([[epistemology]]) on the conventional level and that furthermore, one could make epistemic distinctions about the conventional and know what is conventionally true and what is a falsehood. For example, one can know that a rope on the ground is not a snake (even if one has initially been fooled by it).<ref name=":1" /> For Tsongkhapa, it was not enough to just argue for the emptiness of all phenomena (the ultimate truth), madhyamaka also needed proper epistemic instruments or sources of knowledge (Tib. ''tshad ma'', Skt. ''[[Pramana|pramāṇa]]'') to defend Buddhist views about conventional truths (such as [[Buddhist ethics]]) and to have a coherent sense of why something is true or false.<ref name=":1" />{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=274-275}}{{sfn|Brunnhölzl|2004|p=560}} As Jay Garfield notes, for Tsongkhapa "without an antecedent account of these instruments and their authority, there is no way to distinguish conventional truth from conventional falsity."<ref name=":1" /> Furthermore, Thupten Jinpa writes that Tsongkhapa "does not agree with those who claim that the use of the tetralemma in Madhyamaka implies a denial of fundamental logical principles such as the [[Law of excluded middle|law of the excluded middle]] and the [[Law of noncontradiction|principle of contradiction]]".<ref>[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way'', pp. 37-38. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref>

In order to explain how conventional reality is perceived in a valid way, Tsongkhapa draw on Buddhist pramāṇa philosophy in order to develop his own [[Buddhist logico-epistemology|Buddhist epistemological theory]].{{sfn|Brunnhölzl|2004|p=560}} From Tsongkhapa's perspective, in order for something to exist (conventionally, since nothing exists ultimately), it must be validly designated by a non-impaired functioning consciousness. To talk about an object that does not exist in relation to a subject is incoherent.<ref>Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, ''Understanding the Mind'' Pp 9</ref>{{refn|group=note|"Thus, [Chandrakirti] says that those are synonyms. 'Without depending on another' does not mean not depending on causes and conditions.

Every mental phenomenon includes something as object within itself, although they do not all do so in the same way. In presentation something is presented, in judgment, something is affirmed or denied, in love loved, in hate hated, in desire desired and so on. This intentional in-existence is characteristic exclusively of mental phenomena. No physical phenomenon exhibits anything like it.

McAlister (London: Routledge, 1995), pp. 88–89.}}}} According to  Tsongkhapa, something is validly designated (i.e. it exists conventionally and dependently) if it meets all of the following three conditions:{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=178}}<ref>Newland 2009, pp. 45-48.</ref>

# No other conventional cognition contradicts that which is known from being known in that way;
# Reason that accurately analyzes whether something intrinsically exists does not contradict that which is known.

Thus, according to Tsongkhapa, when Candrakīrti states that “the world is not valid in any way”, he is referring to how ordinary worldly consciousnesses are not valid sources of knowledge with regard to ultimate reality. However, Tsongkhapa argues that Candrakīrti does accept pramāṇas conventionally, since he also states "the world knows objects with four valid cognitions."<ref name=":6" /> As such, while Tsongkhapa reads Candrakīrti as not accepting that conventional sources of knowledge know the intrinsic nature of things (since there are none), he also argues that Candrakīrti affirms that pramāṇas can give us knowledge about conventional reality (even while our sense faculties are also deceptive, in that they also superimpose intrinsic nature).<ref name=":6">Newland 2009, pp. 49-50.</ref>

For Tsongkhapa, there are two valid ways of understanding the world, two levels of explanation: one way which understands conventional phenomena (which are real but also deceptive, like a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]]) and another way which sees the profound ultimate truth of things, which is the sheer fact that they lack intrinsic nature.<ref name=":7" /> As Newland explains, each one of these epistemic points of view provides a different lens or perspective on reality, which Tsongkhapa illustrates by discussing how "we do not see sounds no matter how carefully we look." In the same way, while conventional truths are not found by an ultimate analysis that searches for their intrinsic nature, they are still functional conventionally and this is not discredited by the ultimate truth of emptiness.<ref name=":7" /> Tsongkhapa thinks that if we only relied on the ultimate epistemological point of view, we would not be able to distinguish between [[virtue]] from non-virtue, or [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] from samsara (since ultimate analysis only tells us that they are equally empty). Instead, Tsongkhapa holds that the emptiness must complement, rather than undermine, conventional Buddhist truths.<ref name=":7" />

This is a different interpretation of Candrakīrti's epistemic theory than that adopted by Tibetan figures like [[Gorampa]] and Taktsang Lotsawa, who argue that Candrakīrti's prāsaṅgika mādhyamika rejects all epistemic sources of knowledge since all conventional cognitions are flawed.<ref>Thakchöe, Sonam.

Simon and Schuster.</ref> According to Tsongkhapa, the prāsaṅgika-approach (which is based mainly on using [[reductio ad absurdum]] arguments) is the superior approach to madhyamaka.<ref name="Doctor2"/>{{sfn|Newland|2008–2009|p=77–78}} This is a position which, according to José Cabezón, may be traced back to 11th century figures like the Kashmiri scholar Jayananda and the Tibetan [[Patsab Nyima Drakpa|Patsab]].<ref name="Doctor2"/><ref name=":12" />

Tsongkhapa held that the alternative [[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|svātantrika]] approach to madhyamaka (defended by figures like [[Śāntarakṣita]] or [[Bhāviveka]]) was inferior. Tsongkhapa argued that the svātantrika approach holds that one had to posit autonomous [[syllogism]]s (''svatantrānumāna'') in order to defend madhyamaka and that this insistence implies that phenomena (''[[Abhidharma|dharmas]]'') or at least [[logic]] itself, has intrinsic nature (''[[svabhava]]'') conventionally.<ref name="Doctor2"/><ref>Tsongkhapa, ''The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (Volume Three)''; {{ISBN|1-55939-166-9}}, pp 225–275 after a very lengthy and well-referenced debate, strongly relying upon [[Candrakirti]]'s (a Prasaṅgika) analysis of [[Bhāvaviveka]] (a Svātantrika) in the Prasanna-padā ('Clear Words' La Vallée Poussin (1970) 28.4–29; sDe dGe [[Kanjur]] (Kanakura 1956) 3796: Ha 9a7-b3)</ref>{{sfn|Shantarakshita|2005|p=131–141}}<ref>Newland 2009, p. 82.</ref><ref name=":17">[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002).

''Svatantrika-Prasangika Distinction: What Difference Does a Difference Make?'' pp. 187-188. Simon and Schuster.</ref>

Regarding autonomous syllogistic arguments, Tsongkhapa (like Candrakirti) argues that they are not always necessary and that ''prāsaṅga'' arguments (i.e. reductios) are often enough to prove the madhyamaka view of emptiness by "demonstrating the unwelcome consequences (in any given position that presupposes intrinsic existence)."<ref name=":3" /><ref name="Newland 2009, p. 22">Newland 2009, p. 22.</ref> Tsongkhapa does not reject that madhyamikas can make use of autonomous syllogisms, but he disagrees with Bhāviveka's insistence that they ''must'' use them.<ref>Newland 2009, p. 80.</ref> According to Jinpa, Tsongkhapa here is critiquing what contemporary philosophy would call "the autonomy of reason", "that is, that [[reason]], or [[logic]], possesses its own [[Ontology|ontological]] status as an independent, ultimate reality".<ref name=":17" />

For Tsongkhapa, these key differences reveal that the understanding of emptiness of the [[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|svātantrika]] philosophers is inferior to the [[Prasangika|prāsaṅgikas]], since the svātantrika insistence on the use of autonomous syllogisms implies that they accept intrinsic nature conventionally (and since they think their syllogisms are established on this basis, they hold that their conclusions are certain).<ref>Newland 2009, p. 81.</ref> Tsongkhapa strongly rejects that either phenomenon or reasoning have intrinsic natures or characteristics in any way. Instead, Tsongkhapa holds that all phenomena are dependent and "simply labeled by thought construction" (Tib. ''rtog pas btags tsam'') and thus they are empty of intrinsic nature ''even conventionally''.<ref name=":3" /><ref>Newland 2009, pp. 77-78.</ref>{{sfn|Newland|2008–2009|p=77}} While Tsongkhapa holds that the insistence on the use of syllogisms (and the idea that they provide certainty) reveals a shortcoming in the thought of svātantrika, nevertheless, he thinks that prāsaṅgikas may make use of syllogistic arguments, as long as they do not rely on (conventional) intrinsic characteristics when making use of these syllogisms.{{sfn|Newland|2008–2009|p=78}}<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Tsongkhapa|title=Lamrim Chenmo|pages=229}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|For example, if cause-effect relationships occur because the sprout itself produces the effect of being a sprout (self-arising), then this "would mean that something that already exists is being produced, [and] production would be purposeless and endless [... if] contradictions are assembled in this way, the only result is that the opponents understand them and abandon" wrong tenets.<ref name=":0" /><br />To clarify with a more modern rendition: if 500 people were shown 100,000 slides of a seed turning into a small plant, would we expect them all to agree that on slide number 1,008 the seed causes the sprout?

=== Prāsaṅgikas have a thesis ===
Tsongkhapa also argues that prāsaṅgikas do not just reject all theses or views. Instead, Tsongkhapa holds that while prāsaṅgikas focus on refuting those views which presuppose or posit intrinsic natures (''svabhava''), they ''do'' have a thesis (Skt. ''darśana,'' Tib. ''lta ba'') of their own. This is the view that all phenomena lack intrinsic nature (''niḥsvabhāvavāda''), which is not a dogmatic or false view (''[[View (Buddhism)|dṛṣṭi]]'') to be rejected, but is the rare and correct understanding of emptiness (''śūnyatā''-''darśana'') and dependent origination which allows us to be liberated.<ref name=":3" /><ref>Newland 2009, p. 59.</ref> Tsongkhapa thus affirms that prāsaṅgikas may use syllogisms, make positive assertions, hold positions (which they consider to be true) and argue for them.<ref>Newland 2009, p. 83.</ref> Tsongkhapa also distinguishes between two closely related (and overlapping) but also distinct senses of the term "ultimate" ([[Paramārtha-satya|Skt. ''paramārtha'']]): (1) a "substantially real mode of being" (i.e. intrinsic nature) and (2) the ultimate truth or fact about the world (as opposed to the conventional truths), which is emptiness.  It is due to this distinction that Tsongkhapa is able to state that even though nothing is ultimate in the first sense, madhyamakas do hold a thesis, mainly that emptiness (in the second sense) is a true fact about reality.<ref>[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way,'' pp. 46-47. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref>

While some Tibetan thinkers argued that Nagarjuna's refutation of existence, non-existence, both or neither (called the ''[[catuṣkoṭi]],'' "four corners") meant that he rejected all philosophical views (and all existence) completely, Tsongkhapa disagrees with this interpretation. Instead, Tsongkhapa understands Nagarjuna's negation of the ''catuṣkoṭi'' to refer to the lack of intrinsic existence, intrinsic non-existence etc. Thus, as Guy Newland explains, Tsongkhapa interprets the negation of the ''catuṣkoṭi'' to mean that "we refute the reifying view that things exist ultimately; we refute the nihilistic view that things do not exist even conventionally; we refute that there is any single sense in which things both exist and do not exist; we refute that there is any single sense in which things neither exist nor do not exist."<ref>Newland 2009, p. 61.</ref> As Thupten Jinpa notes, this interpretation of the negative ''catuṣkoṭi'' is based on Tsongkhapa's view that the Sanskrit term ''bhāva'' (existence) has a dual meaning in madhyamaka: one refers to a reified sense of intrinsic existence (which is to be negated) and a conventionally existent actuality, functional thing or event (which is not negated).<ref name=":16">[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way,'' p. 40. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref> Jinpa notes that Tsongkhapa interprets the madhyamaka argument called 'diamond splinters' (''rdo rje gzegs ma''), which refutes the intrinsic arising of dharmas, in a similar manner.<ref name=":16" />

This is also why Tsongkhapa holds that reasoning about means of knowledge or epistemological tools (Skt. ''[[Pramana|pramāṇa]]'') is central to the madhyamaka project, since he thinks that prāsaṅgika-madhyamikas make use of reasoning in order to establish their view of the lack of intrinsic nature conventionally. However, this reasoning derives its efficacy through dependent origination, not through some intrinsic nature or power (whether conventional or otherwise).<ref name=":3" />{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=274-275}}{{sfn|Brunnhölzl|2004|p=560}}

===Eight difficult points of Tsongkhapa's madhyamaka===
The unique aspects of Tsongkhapa's prāsaṅgika madhyamaka philosophy are also often outlined through the "eight difficult points" (''dka' gnad brgyad''), which were set by Tsongkhapa in a series of lecture notes which were later edited by his disciple [[Gyaltsab Je|Gyaltsap Je]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":15">Lobsang Dargyay. ''Tsong-Kha-pa's Understanding of Prasangika Thought.'' Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 10, 1987, Number 1.</ref>

According to Tsongkhapa and Gyaltsap, three of these main ideas relate to ontology and are:<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":15" />

* prāsaṅgika rejects intrinsic characteristics (''sva-lakṣaṇa'') or intrinsic nature (''[[Svabhava|svabhāva]]''), ultimately and conventionally.
* the rejection the [[Eight Consciousnesses|storehouse consciousness]] (''ālāyavijñāna''), ultimately and conventionally.
* the conventional acceptance of external objects (outside the mind), contra [[Yogachara|Yogacara]] [[idealism]].
Four other key points of Tsongkhapa's madhyamaka concern the path to enlightenment and are:<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":15" />
* the nonacceptance of autonomous syllogisms or independent proofs (''rang rgyud'', ''svatantra'') as being a means for developing arguments or establishing the truth. Instead, Tsongkhapa's madhyamaka uses a "presupposition or reason which is well known by opponents" (''gzhan grags'', ''paraprasiddha'') in order to illustrate the errors in the views of one's opponents.
* the rejection of [[Svasaṃvedana|self-awareness]] (Sk. ''sva-saṃvitti'', ''sva-saṃvedana''), even conventionally. Tsongkhapa thinks that to posit a consciousness that can operate on itself introduces a kind of essentialism. Like [[Shantideva]], he also argues that this idea is logically incoherent. Following Shantideva, Tsongkhapa cites the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra|Lankavatara]]'' which says "just as the blade of a sword cannot cut itself, and just as a fingernail cannot touch itself, so too is it true of one's mind."<ref>[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way,'' p. 127. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref>
* the way in which the two obscurations exist.
* the acceptance that the [[Śrāvaka|disciples]] and [[Pratyekabuddhayāna|solitary Buddhas]] realize the emptiness of phenomena. This means that for Tsongkhapa, [[Hinayana|hīnayāna]] [[arhat]]s also realize the same emptiness that Mahayanists realize, since both the emptiness of persons and the emptiness of phenomena are intertwined and one logically entails the other.<ref>Newland 2009, p. 25.</ref>

One final point concerns the result or fruit (of the path) i.e. Buddhahood. For Tsongkhapa, fully awakened Buddhas ''do'' perceive all of conventional reality in their fullest extent (even impure things).<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":15" />

Regarding the storehouse consciousness (''ālāyavijñāna''), Tsongkhapa holds that this theory is rejected by the ultimate view of prāsaṅgika madhyamaka. However, he agrees that this teaching may be of provisional use for some individuals (since it was taught by the Buddha in some sutras) who hold to a lower view, are not able to fully understand emptiness and have a "fear of annihilation".{{sfn|Hopkins|1994|p=245}}<ref>Cozort, Daniel (1998). ''Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School,'' p. 436, Snow Lion Publications.</ref><ref name="ReferenceC">Cozort, Daniel. "Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School" Pg 236-7</ref> Tsongkhapa relies on Chandrakirti's refutation of the storehouse consciousness, particularly in ''[[Madhyamakāvatāra]]'' VI, 39.<ref name=":15" />

Tsongkhapa also presents an alternative view of explaining [[personal identity]], [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]. These are explained through a "mere I" (''nga tsam'') that is dependently designated on the basis of the five aggregates.<ref>[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way,'' pp. 109-110. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref>{{sfn|Hopkins|1994|p=245}}{{refn|group=note|According to the [[Gelugpa]], the [[Yogachara|Chittamatra]] hold that the mind-basis-of-all consciousness is that which bears the karmic seeds and is findable upon analysis. That is, "if one sought the basis of the designation ''of the person'' one would discover the mind-basis-of-all."<ref>Cozort, Daniel. "Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School" Pg 235</ref> The Madhyamika-Prasangika posit that beings accumulate karma and experience their effects without the mind-basis-of-all? They posit that karma is carried on the mere "I" which is dependently designated on the basis of the [[Skandha|aggregates]], stating that "it is a sufficient basis with which to associate the factors of disintegratedness ([[karma]])."<ref>Cozort, Daniel. "Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School" Pg 236</ref> Daniel Cozant expands by saying that since phenomena are neither inherently created nor inherently destroyed according to Prasangika, that "therefore, the possibility of a later effect is not precluded."<ref name="ReferenceC">Cozort, Daniel. "Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School" Pg 236-7</ref>}} Tsongkhapa states that "we should maintain that the object of our innate I-consciousness is the mere person – i.e., the mere I - which is the focus of our natural sense of self".<ref>[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way,'' p. 117. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref> This conventional and dependent sense of self or I-consciousness is a pre-linguistic and pre-conceptual instinctive process.<ref>[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way,'' pp. 119-125. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref> When rebirth occurs, an individual's mental continuum (''rgyun'') moves from one life to another, just like a river or stream moves along. The continuum's "mere I" carries the past life karmic imprints to the next life and there is thus no need to posit a separate kind of "storehouse" consciousness for karmic imprints.<ref>[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way,'' pp. 135-138. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref>

Tsongkhapa also rejects Buddhist [[idealism]] (which was associated with the [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]] school and various Tibetan madhyamaka authors) and thus affirms the conventional existence of an external world (like [[Bhāviveka|Bhaviveka]]).<ref name=":3" /><ref>Newland 2009, p. 22</ref> As Newland writes, Tsongkhapa's madhyamaka "does assert that there is a fully functioning external world, a world that exists outside of our minds. However, in the same breath it emphasizes that this external world is utterly dependent upon consciousness."<ref>Newland 2009, p. 74.</ref> In his rejection of Yogācāra idealism, Tsongkhapa follows Chandrakirti's refutation of Yogacara in the ''[[Madhyamakāvatāra]]''.<ref>[[Richard Hayes (professor)|Hayes, Richard]] (2019), "[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2019/entries/madhyamaka/ Madhyamaka]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Edward N. Zalta (ed.).</ref>

=== Hermeneutics ===
Tsongkhapa also wrote on [[Buddhist hermeneutics]], which is a major subject of his ''Essence of Eloquence.'' Tsongkhapa held that it was important to have a proper understanding of [[hermeneutics]] in order to properly interpret the many seemingly contradictory statements found in the Buddhist [[sutra]]s and [[Shastra|scholastic treatises]].<ref name=":3" /> According to Tsongkhapa, the main criteria for interpreting the various statements attributed to the Buddha is human [[reason]] (Sk. ''yukti'', Tib. ''rigs pa''), particularly the kind of reasoning which analyzes phenomena to find their ultimate nature (which is emptiness, the lack of intrinsic nature itself).<ref name=":3" /> Furthermore, Tsongkhapa relies on the ''[[Akṣayamatinirdeśa Sūtra|Teachings of Akshayamati Sutra]]'' (Skt. ''Akṣayamatinirdeśa''; Wyl. ''blo gros mi zad pas bstan pa'') which states that the sutras of definitive meaning are those sutras which teach emptiness (such as the [[Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras|''Prajñāpāramitā'' sutras]]).<ref name="Newland 2009, p. 20">Newland 2009, p. 20.</ref>

Because of this, for Tsongkhapa, all statements and passages in the various sutras or treatises which do not express this lack of intrinsic nature are not definitive or ultimate statements (Skt. ''nitartha'') and are thus statements which "require further interpretation" or "need to be fully drawn out" (''neyartha'').<ref name=":3" /> This includes all texts belonging to the ''[[Śrāvakayāna|Śrāvaka]]'' schools, all [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]] works as well as non-prāsaṅgika madhyamaka philosophy (like Bhāviveka and Śāntarakṣita).<ref name=":3" /> This also includes all sutras and statements regarding the important concept of ''tathāgatagarbha'' (i.e. [[Buddha-nature]]) or the [[luminous mind]], which for Tsongkhapa, are just an expedient way of describing the emptiness of the mind and its defilements, as well as the potential for Buddhahood which all beings have.<ref name=":18" /><ref>[[Thupten Jinpa]] (2002). ''Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy - Tsongkhapa's quest for the middle way,'' pp. 139-140. RoutledgeCurzon.</ref> In this he follows Indian madhyamikas like [[Bhāviveka|Bhaviveka]] and [[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]] as well as Kadam scholars such as [[Ngok Loden Sherab|Ngog Loden Sherab]] and Chaba Chokyi Senge.<ref name=":18">Brunnholzl, Karl (2014). ''When the Clouds Part, The Uttaratantra and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra,'' pp. 55, 66. Boston & London: Snow Lion.</ref>

For Tsongkhapa, only the madhyamaka view of Nagarjuna (as understood by prāsaṅgikas like [[Aryadeva]], [[Buddhapālita|Buddhapalita]], Candrakīrti and [[Shantideva]]) is a definitive interpretation of the final intent of the Buddha.<ref name="Newland 2009, p. 22"/> However, because of the Buddha's [[bodhicitta]], he explains the teaching in a wide variety of (''neyartha'') ways, all of which are ultimately based in and lead to the final insight into emptiness.<ref name=":3" />

=== Critiques against Tsongkhapa ===
According to Thupten Jinpa, the main critics of Tsongkhapa's thought were Sakya scholars. The first Sakya scholar to openly critique Tsongkhapa was Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen (1367-1449) and his critiques were met by responses written by [[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama|Khedrup Je]].<ref>Pettit, John W. (2013). ''Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, the Great Perfection,'' p. 136. Simon and Schuster.</ref> The philosophical critique of Tsongkhapa was later continued by a trio of Sakya school thinkers: Taktsang Lotsawa, [[Gorampa]], and Shākya Chokden, all followers of Rongton.<ref name=":22"/><ref name=":19" />

According to Jinpa, Taktsang's critique focuses on "Tsongkhapa's insistence on the need to maintain a robust notion of conventional truth grounded in some verifiable criteria of validity". For Taktsang, epistemology is faulty and thus Tsongkhapa's attempt at a synthesis of madhyamaka and pramana leads to serious problems.<ref name=":22">Jinpa 2019, pp. 329-365.</ref> Gorampa meanwhile argued that Tsongkhapa's definition of emptiness as an absolute negation of intrinsic existence was a form of nihilism. He also took issue with Tsongkhapa's characterization of conventional truth as a kind of existence.<ref name=":22" />

Later Kagyu figures also penned critiques of some of Tsongkhapa's views, such as Mikyö Dorje. Gelug scholars like Lekpa Chöjor (a.k.a. Jamyang Galo, 1429–1503), the first [[Panchen Lama]], Lozang Chökyi Gyaltsen (1507–1662), Jetsun Chökyi Gyaltsen (1469–1544/46), Sera Jetsun Chökyi Gyaltsen, Panchen Delek Nyima and [[Jamyang Zhepa]] (1648–1751) penned various responses to these various critiques in defense of Tsongkhapa's views.<ref name=":22"/><ref name=":20" />

== Teachings on Buddhist practice ==
[[file:Großlama_oder_Tsonghkapa_Linden-Museum.jpg|thumb|250px|Statue of Tsongkhapa, [[Linden Museum|Linden-Museum]], [[Stuttgart]]]]

=== Mahayana Sutra Teachings ===
Tsongkhapa was acquainted with all Tibetan Buddhist traditions of his time, and received teachings and transmission in all major [[Sarma (Buddhism)|Sarma]] schools of Tibetan Buddhism.<ref name="CM6" /> His main source of inspiration was the [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] school of [[Atiśa]] (982–1054), especially the Kadampa [[Lamrim]] ("Stages of the Path") teachings.<ref name="CM6" /> Another important source for Tsongkhapa are the works of Asanga, including the ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogacarabhumi]]'' and ''[[Abhidharma-samuccaya]]''.<ref name=":5" /> He also draws on [[Kamalaśīla|Kamalashila's]] ''[[Bhāvanākrama|Stages of Meditation]]'' and on [[Shantideva|Shantideva's]] works.<ref name=":5" />

The most popular source for Tsongkhapa's teachings on the Mahayana sutra path is his ''Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment'' (''Lamrim Chenmo'').<ref name=":5">Tsong Khapa (2014) Volume 1, Introduction.</ref> He also wrote a Middle Length Lamrim Treatise and a Small Lamrim Treatise. Tsongkhapa's presentation generally follows the classic Kadam Lamrim system, which is divided into three main scopes or motivations (modest, medium and higher i.e. [[Mahayana]]).<ref name=":5" />

Tsongkhapa's presentation of the Mahayana bodhisattva path focuses on the [[Pāramitā|six perfections]]. Regarding the [[Prajnaparamita|perfection of wisdom]] (''prajñāpāramitā''), Tsongkhapa emphasizes the importance of reasoning, analytical investigation as well as the close study and contemplation of the [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist scriptures]].<ref>Newland 2009, pp. 10-14</ref> Indeed, according to Tsongkhapa, the broad study of the Buddhist texts is the “sacred life force of the path,” which is a necessary complement to the practice of meditation.<ref name="Newland 2009, p. 14">Newland 2009, p. 14</ref>

==== Insight meditation and the object of negation ====
For Tsongkhapa, all Buddhist forms of meditation can fall into two broad categories which must be balanced and fully developed together: calming meditation (''[[Samatha|śamatha]]''), which are "meditations that engage and strengthen our capacity to focus and to stabilize the mind without distraction—culminating in perfect serenity" and insight meditations which "use and develop the capacity to discern and to analyze the qualities of an object—culminating in meditative wisdom".<ref name="Newland 2009, p. 14"/>

In his Lamrim works, Tsongkhapa presents a unique way of mediation for the development of insight (Skt. [[Vipassanā|''vipaśyanā'']], Tib. ''lhag mthong''). As Newland explains, for Tsongkhapa, the root of suffering and samsara is an "innate tendency to hold a distorted, reifying view of ourselves" (as well as of other phenomena). To develop the wisdom to see through this habit requires using reasoned analysis or analytical investigation (''so sor rtog pa'') to arrive at the right view of emptiness (the lack of intrinsic nature).<ref name="Newland 2009, p. 8"/><ref name=":5" />{{refn|group=note|In his ''Lamrim Chenmo'', Tsongkhapa refers to opponents{{refn|group=note|It is unclear which specific school of thought Tsongkhapa refers here to.}} who argue that it is absurd "to conduct the extensive rational analysis required for refutations and proofs [which] is to meander among mere conventional words," because "if something exists, it cannot be refuted, and, if it does not exist, it need not be refuted." {{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=205}} In response, Tsonghkhapa refers to Nagarjuna’s ''Refutation of Objections'', among other texts, :<br />"What use is it to establish the negation<br />if what does not exist anyway, even without words?<br />To answer that, the words “does not exist”<br />Cause understanding; they do not eliminate."{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=204-5}}<br /><br />HTsongkhapa also quotes Nagarjuna's  ''Commentary on Refutation of Objections'': "The words, “All things lack intrinsic nature,” do not cause things to lack intrinsic nature, but, in the absence of intrinsic nature, they do make it understood that things lack intrinsic nature."{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=205}}<br /><br />Tsongkhapa then gives the following paraphrased example. If a person named Devadatta is not in the house, but someone says, “Devadatta is in the house.” Then in order to show that Devadatta is not there, someone else will say, “Devadatta is not there.” Those words do not cause Devadatta not to be there but allow the first person to understand that Devadatta is not in the house. Similarly, the words, “Things lack intrinsic nature,” do not cause things to lack intrinsic nature, but help those confused by ignorance to gain a [[Pramana#Buddhism|valid cognition]] of reality.{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=205}}}} Establishing the correct view of emptiness initially requires us to 'identify the object of negation', which according to Tsongkhapa (quoting Chandrakirti) is "a consciousness that superimposes an essence of things".<ref>Newland 2009, pp. 23-24.</ref> If we do not do this correctly, we may end up either negating too much (which could lead nihilism, with negative consequences for our ethics) or negating too little (and thus leaving some subtle sense of reification untouched).<ref>Newland 2009, p. 29.</ref> Thus, for Tsongkhapa, we first need to properly identify and understand our own inner sense of reification. It is only after we have identified this in ourselves that we can refute and eliminate this error through introspective analysis, contemplation and meditation.<ref name="Newland 2009, p. 17">Newland 2009, p. 17.</ref>

At the same time, we also must avoid the trap of a nihilistic view that invalidates the dependently arisen nature of things (i.e. mere existence or seeming reality) and confuses the lack of intrinsic nature with totally negating the existence of a relative and conventional self.{{sfn|Brunnhölzl|2004|p=567}}{{sfn|Jinpa|2006|p=374}}<ref name="PatrickJennings" /> This is because, for Tsongkhapa, the "I" or self is accepted as nominally existing in a dependent and conventional way, while the object to be negated is the inner fiction of intrinsic nature which is "erroneously reified" by our cognition.{{sfn|Hopkins|1999|p=49}}{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=215}}{{refn|group=note|See:<br />* Hopkins: "[I]f you have understood the view of the Middle Way School, you may conceive the I as only being nominally existent."{{sfn|Hopkins|1999|p=49}}<br />* Tsongkhapa: "“self” refers to mere essential or intrinsic existence and also refers to the object of an awareness that simply thinks, “I.” Of these two, the former is the object negated by reason, whereas the latter is accepted conventionally, so it is not refuted."{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=215}}}}{{sfn|Garfield|Thakchöe|2011|p=77}} Tsongkhapa explains this mistaken inner reification which is to be negated as "a natural belief [a naive, normal, pre-philosophical way of seeing the world], which leads us to perceive things and events as possessing some kind of intrinsic existence and identity".{{sfn|Jinpa|2006|p=374}}{{sfn|Garfield|Thakchöe|2011|p=77}}{{sfn|Jinpa|2006|p=374}}<!-- **START OF NOTE** -->{{refn|group=note|It is the conception that conventional phenomena have an "ontological status—a way of existing—in and of themselves, without being posited through the force of an awareness."{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=212}}Tsongkhapa goes on to say: "The referent object that is thus apprehended by that ignorant conception, the independent ontological status of those phenomena, is identified as [the] hypothetical “self” or “intrinsic nature.”<ref name="LRC">Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo Pg 212</ref><br />Lama Tsongkhapa further explains: "Suppose that we leave aside analysis of how [phenomena] appear—i.e., how they appear to a conventional awareness—and analyze the objects themselves, asking, 'What is the manner of being of these phenomena?'

The process of refuting the intrinsic existence of the self is described in chapter 23 of ''Lamrim Chenmo'' vol. 3, and entails four steps:{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=291-307}} {{refn|It has become a stock procedure of the Gelugpa:See, for example, Jeffrey Hopkins'ontroduction to the ''Kalachakra Tantra''.}}

* The refutation of the position that the self is different from the aggregates;
* How those arguments also refute each of the remaining positions;
* How the person appears like an illusion based on that refutation.

According to Tsongkhapa, Buddhist essentialists (like [[Vaibhāṣika|Vaibhasikas]]) and non-Buddhist essentialists ([[Atman-Brahman|atmavadins]]) are not negating the correct object,{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=211}} but are only negating "imaginary constructs" and "acquired ignorance" and thus they only realize a coarse selflessness which only suppresses, but not removes, the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)#Two obscurations|obstructions]] to [[nirvana|liberation]] from samsara.<!-- **START OF NOTE** -->{{refn|group=note|Tsonghkhapa: "Based on just this [intrinsic nature], the referent object of the way that ignorance apprehends things as explained above, essentialist schools—'''Buddhist and non-Buddhist'''—reify many different things.

Therefore, those who have the faculty of wisdom should understand that the referent object of innate ignorance is the basic object of negation and should not devote themselves merely to refuting imaginary constructs that are imputed only by the advocates of philosophical tenets. [...] What binds all living beings in cyclic existence is innate ignorance; acquired ignorance exists only among those who advocate philosophical tenets, so it cannot be the root of cyclic existence. It is extremely important to gain specific and certain knowledge of this point."{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=211}}}}<!-- **END OF NOTE** --> <!-- **START OF NOTE** -->{{refn|group=note|Daniel Cozort explaining this idea in greater detail:"A second category of tenets is concerned with implications of the Mahayana and Hinayana path structures.

These tenets, then, revolve around the unique Prasangika assertion that the root of cyclic existence is the conception of inherent existence, which is more subtle than the conception of a self described by other systems of tenets. Five assertions are elucidated in this regard: 
* One must realize emptiness in order to become liberated and therefore some ''"Arhats"'' who have only realized a coarse selflessness are not actually liberated.
* There is desire that either is, or is thoroughly mixed with, the conception of true existence, and so-called Arhats still have this sort of desire.
* Although some of these "Arhats" do indeed have yogic direct perception of the four noble truths, one does not have to be an Arhat or even a Superior (one who has directly realized emptiness) in order to have such yogic direct perception.
* Although some of these "Arhats" have indeed realized the coarse aspects of the four noble truths, such a realization is not sufficient to overcome the obstructions to liberation.
* Since true cessations, the irrevocable cessation of some portion of the afflictions of desire, hatred, etc., are also emptinesses, such "Arhats" who have not realized emptiness could not have experienced true cessations, i.e., could not have overcome the afflictive obstructions."<ref>Cozort, Daniel ''Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School Pg 235</ref>}}<!-- **END OF NOTE** --> According to Tsongkhapa, only a negation which undercuts the innate perception of an inherently existing self is truly liberating.<!-- **START OF NOTE** -->{{refn|group=note|Chandrakirti: "When knowing selflessness, some eliminate a permanent self, but we do not consider this to be the basis of the conception of "I."

[This is equivalent to] if someone sees a snake living in the wall of his house. To ease his concern, someone else says, 'there is no elephant there.'

Tsongkhapa rejects the idea that meditation is only about throwing away all concepts, instead, we need to gradually refine our understanding until it becomes non-conceptual wisdom.<ref name="Newland 2009, p. 20"/> While Tsongkhapa emphasizes the importance of attaining the correct conceptual understanding of emptiness through this analytical contemplation, he also understands that this knowledge is not the actual realization of emptiness itself (which is non-conceptual and non-dualistic). As such, according to Tsongkhapa, after one has attained the correct conceptual understanding of emptiness, this insight needs to be refined through repeated calming meditation practice (and the [[samadhi]] which it produces) and continued familiarization with insight meditation. Over time, one's insight is transformed into a nondualistic and non-conceptual experience of emptiness.<ref name="Newland 2009, p. 17"/>

=== Vajrayana (Secret Mantra) ===
[[File:Manjuvajramandala_con_43_divinità_-_Unknown_-_Google_Cultural_Institute.jpg|right|thumb|[[Guhyasamāja Tantra|Guhyasamāja]] mandala with Mañjuvajra as the central deity]]

Tsongkhapa also practised and taught extensively on [[Vajrayana]] (i.e. Secret Mantra) Buddhism. He wrote commentaries on some of the main [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] tantras, including the ''[[Yamantaka|Vajrabhairava]]'', ''[[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra|Cakrasaṃvara]]'', ''[[Kalachakra|Kālacakra]]'' and ''[[Guhyasamāja Tantra|Guhyasamāja]]'' tantras.<ref name="CM6" /><ref name=":3" /> He also wrote a grand summary of tantric thought and practice, ''The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra''. Tsongkhapa's tantric theory draws extensively on the two main commentarial traditions of the'' Guhyasamāja Tantra''.<ref>Arnold, Edward A. (2021). ''[https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-c3ht-bt53 Tsongkhapa’s Coordination of Sūtra and Tantra: Ascetic Performance, Narrative, and Philosophy in the Creation of the Tibetan Buddhist Self],.'' pp. 283-284. Doctoral Thesis, Columbia University.</ref> Tsongkhapa also heavily relies on the works of [[Marpa Lotsawa]] (1012–1097) and [[Buton Rinchen Drub|Butön Rinchendrub]] (1290–1364), both of whom passed down lineages of the ''Guhyasamāja tantra'', a text which Tsongkhapa considered to be the "king of tantras".<ref name=":3" /><ref>Tsongkhapa, The Dalai Lama, Hopkins, Jeffrey (2016), p. vii.</ref><ref>Tsongkhapa (translated by Gavin Kilty) (2012), ''A Lamp to Illuminate the Five Stages: Teachings on Guhyasamaja Tantra'', pp. 11-12, 14. Simon and Schuster</ref> His close connection to the ''Guhyasamāja'' tradition was such that he referred to himself as a "''Guhyasamāja'' yogi" and saw himself as a reviver and reformer of the tradition (and thus he composed various works on this tantric tradition).<ref>Tsongkhapa (translated by Gavin Kilty) (2012), ''A Lamp to Illuminate the Five Stages: Teachings on Guhyasamaja Tantra'', p. 12. Simon and Schuster.</ref>

For Tsongkhapa, Buddhist tantra is based on the same madhyamaka view of emptiness as sutra (non-tantric) Mahāyāna and that they both also share the same goal ([[Buddhahood]]).<ref>Tsongkhapa, The Dalai Lama, Hopkins, Jeffrey (2016), pp. 189-190.</ref> As such, Tsongkhapa sees Secret Mantra as being a subset of Mahāyāna Buddhism, and thus it also requires [[bodhicitta]] and insight into emptiness (through ''vipaśyanā'' meditation) as a foundation. Secret Mantra is only differentiated from sutra by its special method, the esoteric practice of [[deity yoga]] (Tib. ''lha'i rnal 'byor''), which is a much faster method than the practice of the six perfections alone.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":14">Tsongkhapa, The Dalai Lama, Hopkins, Jeffrey (2016), pp. viii, 189-194.</ref> Tsongkhapa also argues that complete Buddhahood can ultimately only be attained through the practice of [[Classes of Tantra in Tibetan Buddhism|Highest Yoga Tantra]] (while the lower practices of the perfections and the other tantras aid one in advancing on the path). However, Tsongkhapa also holds that non-tantric Mahāyāna practices are indispensable the practice of Secret Mantra and that bodhicitta is the basis for the practice of both sutra Mahāyāna and Secret Mantra.<ref>Tsongkhapa, The Dalai Lama, Hopkins, Jeffrey (2016), pp. 189-194, 211-215.</ref>

Thus, for Tsongkhapa, the sutra bodhisattva path (and its three principal aspects of renunciation, bodhicitta and insight into emptiness) must precede the practice of Secret Mantra.<ref>Arnold, Edward A. (2021). ''[https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-c3ht-bt53 Tsongkhapa’s Coordination of Sūtra and Tantra: Ascetic Performance, Narrative, and Philosophy in the Creation of the Tibetan Buddhist Self],.'' p. 286. Doctoral Thesis, Columbia University.</ref> Indeed, according to Tsongkhapa, without having ascertained emptiness, one cannot practice the tantric yogas of Vajrayana. As Tsongkhapa states in ''A Lamp to Illuminate the Five Stages:''<blockquote>for those who enter the Vajra Vehicle, it is necessary to search for an understanding of the view that has insight into the no-self emptiness and then to meditate upon its significance in order to abandon holding to reality, the root of samsara.<ref>Tsongkhapa (translated by Gavin Kilty) (2012), ''A Lamp to Illuminate the Five Stages: Teachings on Guhyasamaja Tantra'', pp. 98. Simon and Schuster</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Tsong-Khapa-Je-Tsongkhapa.jpg|right|thumb|Bronze depicting Tsongkhapa, who is known and revered by Mongolians as Bogd Zonkhova]]
Tsongkhapa promoted the study of [[pramana]] ([[epistemology]]), encouraged formal debates as part of [[Buddhadharma|Dharma]] studies,<ref name=CM6/> and instructed disciples in the [[Guhyasamāja tantra|Guhyasamāja]], [[Kalacakra]], and [[Hevajra]] Tantras.<ref name=CM6/> Tsongkhapa's writings comprise eighteen volumes, with the largest amount being on ''[[Guhyasamāja tantra]]''. These 18 volumes contain hundreds of titles relating to all aspects of Buddhist teachings and clarify some of the most difficult topics of [[Sutrayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] teachings. Tsongkhapa's main treatises and commentaries on Madhyamaka are based on the tradition descended from [[Nagarjuna]] as elucidated by [[Buddhapālita]] and [[Candrakīrti]].
