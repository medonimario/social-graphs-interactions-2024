'''Yi Hwang''' ({{Korean|이황|李滉 }}; 1501–1570) was a Korean philosopher, writer, and [[Korean Confucianism|Confucian]] scholar of the [[Joseon]] period.<ref>Daehwan, Noh. [http://www.ekoreajournal.net/upload/html/HTML43412.html "The Eclectic Development of Neo-Confucianism and Statecraft from the 18th to the 19th Century,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614035130/http://www.ekoreajournal.net/upload/html/HTML43412.html |date=June 14, 2011 }} ''Korea Journal.'' Winter 2003.</ref> He is considered the most important philosopher of Korea - he is honored by printing his portrait on the 1000 [[South Korean won]] banknote, on the reverse of which one can see an image of his school, [[Dosan Seowon]]. He was of the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] literati, established the Yeongnam School and set up the [[Dosan Seowon]], a private Confucian academy.<ref name="yh doosan">{{in lang|ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=128831 Yi Hwang] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]</ref>

Yi Hwang is often referred to by his [[art name]] '''Toegye''' ("Retreating [[Creek (waterway)|Creek]]"). His [[courtesy name]] was '''Gyeongho'''.<ref name="yh ekc">{{in lang|ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=266705&v=43 Yi Hwang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610014452/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=266705&v=43 |date=2011-06-10 }} at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture</ref>

His interpretation of Neo-Confucianism was influential not only in Korea, but also in Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam, and is now being studied even in the mainland China. His main work, ''Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning'', originally published in [[classical Chinese]] language, has been already translated into modern Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, English, French, German, Russian and Polish.

Some of his writings were looted by the Japanese military during the Japanese invasion of Korea.

== Biography ==
Yi Hwang was born in Ongye-ri, [[Andong]], in the north of [[Gyeongsang Province]], in 1501. He belonged to the [[Lee (Korean name)|Jinbo Yi]] clan, and was the youngest son among eight children.<ref name="yh aks">{{in lang|ko}} [http://people.aks.ac.kr/front/tabCon/ppl/pplView.aks?pplId=PPL_6JOa_A1501_1_0011100 Yi Hwang] at The Academy of Korean Studies</ref> A child prodigy, he learned the ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'' from his uncle at age twelve and admiring the poetry of [[Tao Yuanming]], started writing poetry. His poem ''Yadang'' ({{Korean|hangul=야당|hanja=野塘|labels=no}}, "Pond in the Wild"), written at the age of eighteen, is considered one of his major works.<ref name="yh ekc"/><ref>{{in lang|ko}} [http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=103&oid=081&aid=0000043131 君子有終], Seoul Sinmun, 2005-05-18. Retrieved 2010-07-07.</ref> Around the age of twenty, he immersed himself in the study of [[I Ching]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]].<ref name="yh ekc"/><ref name="yh bk">{{in lang|ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&i=180790&v=43 Yi Hwang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610014515/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&i=180790&v=43 |date=2011-06-10 }} at Britannica Korea</ref>

He came to [[Seoul]] (then known as Hanseong) when he was 23 years old and entered the national academy [[Sungkyunkwan]] in 1523. In 1527 he passed preliminary exams to become a government official, but re-entered Sungkyunkwan at the age of 33 and socialized with the scholar [[Kim In-hu]]. He passed the civil service exams with top honors in 1534 and continued his scholarly pursuits whilst working for the government.<ref name="yh ekc"/> He returned to his childhood home at the death of his mother at the age of 37 and mourned her for 3 years. He was appointed various positions from the age of 39 and sometimes held multiple positions including [[secret royal inspector]], or ''Amhaengeosa'' ({{Korean|hangul=암행어사|hanja=暗行御史|labels=no}}), in 1542. His integrity made him relentless as he took part in purges of corrupt government officials. On numerous occasions he was even exiled from the capital for his firm commitment to principle.<ref name="yh doosan"/>

Yi Hwang was disillusioned by the power struggles and discord in the royal court during the later years of [[Jungjong of Joseon|King Jungjong]]'s reign and left political office. However, he was continuously brought out of retirement and held several positions away from the royal court and in rural areas. He was the governor of [[Danyang County|Danyang]] at 48 and governor of [[Punggi-eup|Punggi]] afterwards. During his days at Pungi he redeveloped and improved the private [[Neo-Confucian]] academy [[Sosu Seowon|Baekundong Seowon]] established by his predecessor [[Sosu Seowon|Ju Se-bung]].<ref name="yh ekc"/>

He was named ''Daesaseong'' (대사성, head instructor) of Sungkyunkwan in 1552 but turned down other prominent offices later on. In 1560, he established the ''Dosan [[seodang]]'' and engrossed himself in meditation, study, and teaching his disciples. [[Myeongjong of Joseon|King Myeongjong]] tried to coax him back to political office, but he was steadfast in his devotion to study. He finally returned to the royal court at 67 upon the king's request when envoys from the [[Ming dynasty]] came to Seoul. When King Myeongjong suddenly died, his successor [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]] appointed Yi Hwang as ''Yejo panseo'' ({{Korean|hangul=예조판서|hanja=禮曹判書|labels=no}}, minister of rites) but he declined and returned to his home once again.<ref name="yh ekc"/><ref name="yh aks"/>

However, the king continuously called Yi Hwang back and unable to refuse further, he resumed office at the age of 68 and wrote many advisory documents including ''Seonghak sipdo'' ({{Korean|hangul=성학십도|hanja=聖學十圖|labels=no}}, "Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning"). He also gave lectures from the teachings of [[Song dynasty]] Confucian scholars [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] and [[Cheng Hao]], [[I Ching]], [[Analects]], and [[Zhang Zai]] in royal presence. He finally retired from politics at the age of 70 and died in 1570.<ref name="yh ekc"/>

During forty years of public life he served four kings ([[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]], [[Injong of Joseon|Injong]], [[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]] and [[Seonjo of Joseon|Seonjo]]). On his death, Yi Hwang was posthumously promoted to the highest ministerial rank, and his mortuary tablet housed in a Confucian shrine as well as in the shrine of [[King Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]]. His disciples and followers reorganized the ''Dosan [[seodang]]'' to [[Dosan Seowon]] in 1574.<ref name="yh ekc"/><ref name="yh aks"/>

==Teachings==
Yi Hwang was the author of many books on Confucianism. He followed the dualistic [[Neo-Confucianism]] teachings of [[Zhu Xi]], which views ''i'' (Chinese "li") and ''gi'' (Chinese "qi") as the forces of foundation of the universe. Yi Hwang placed emphasis on the ''i'', the formative element, as the existential force that determines ''gi''. This school of thought contrasted with the school that focused on the concrete element of ''gi'', established by Yi Hwang's counterpart [[Yi I]]. Understanding the determinative pattern of ''i'' would be more essential in understanding the universe than recognizing the principles that govern individual manifestations of ''gi''. This approach of placing importance on the role of ''i'' became the core of the Yeongnam School, where Yi Hwang's legacy was carried on by prominent figures such as [[Yu Seong-ryong]] and [[Kim Seong-il]].<ref>Lee Hyun-hee, Park Sung-soo, Yoon Nae-hyun, translated by The Academy of Korean Studies, ''New History of Korea'' pp 392–393, Jimoondang, Paju, 2005. {{ISBN|89-88095-85-5}}</ref>

Yi Hwang was also talented in calligraphy and poetry, writing a collection of ''[[sijo]]'', a three line poetic form popular with the literati of the Joseon period.<ref name="yh ekc"/>

===Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning===
The Neo-Confucian literature of ''Seonghaksipdo'' was composed by Yi Hwang in 1568 for [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]]. It is a series of lectures for rulers through examples of past sages.<ref>{{in lang|ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=92451 Seonghaksipdo] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]</ref> Traditional Confucians had affirmed that any man could learn to become a sage; the new Confucians made the ideal of sagehood real and attainable, just as enlightenment was for Buddhists. Yi Hwang intended to present that path by starting each chapter with a diagram and related text drawn from Zhu Xi or another leading authority, and concluding with a brief commentary. He intended for "Ten Diagrams" to be made into a ten paneled standing screen, as well as a short book, so that the mind of the viewer could be constantly engaged with its contents, until it totally assimilated the material.<ref>[http://faculty.washington.edu/mkalton/Ten%20Diagrams.htm Ten Diagrams], Michael C. Kalton, Columbia University Press, 1988</ref>
