'''Shen Buhai''' ({{zh|c=申不害}}; c. 400&nbsp;BC{{snd}}c. 337&nbsp;BC){{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=874}} was a Chinese essayist, philosopher, and politician. The [[Shiji]] records that he served as [[Chancellor of China|Chancellor]] of the [[Han (Warring States)|Han]] state under [[Marquis Zhao of Han]] for fifteen years, from 351 BC or 354 to his supposed death in 337 BC. He died of natural causes while in office.<ref>Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies XII, An Outline of the Former Han Dynasty

Hsieh, 1995. p.90 Chinese Thought: An Introduction.</ref> A contemporary of syncretist [[Shi Jiao]] and "Legalist" [[Shang Yang]], he was born in the State of [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], and was likely a minor official there. After Han conquered Zheng in 375 BC, he rose up in the ranks of the Han officialdom, dividing up its territories and successfully reforming it. 

Though not dealing in Shang Yang's doctrine of reward and punishment, his administrative innovations would be incorporated into [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|"Chinese Legalist"]] statecraft by [[Han Fei]], his most famous successor. Shen Buhai's fragments most resembles the [[Han Feizi]], though more conciliatory.

Though the origins of the Chinese administrative system cannot be traced to any one person, prime minister Shen Buhai may have had more influence than any other in the construction of the [[merit system]], and might be considered its founder, if not valuable as a rare pre-modern example of abstract theory of administration. Sinologist [[Herrlee G. Creel]] saw in Shen Buhai the "seeds of the [[imperial examination|civil service examination]]," and perhaps even the first [[political science|political scientist]].<ref>Graham, A.

Although Sinologists [[Benjamin I. Schwartz|Benjamin Schwartz]] and Hansen would take [[Shen Dao]] as a more relevant Daoist forebear, Creel believed that Shen Buhai's correlation between an inactive ([[Wu-wei]]) ruler, and a handling of claims and titles likely informed the Daoist conception of the formless Dao (name that cannot be named) that "gives rise to the ten thousand things." He is credited with the dictum: The Sage ruler relies on measures and not on wisdom; he relies on technique, not on persuasions.<ref>

==Dating==
Only the questionable death date of Shen Buhai in 337 B.C. is correlated between multiple sources.  He is supposed by [[Ch'ien Mu]] to have lived sixty or seventy years. The birth date of 400 B.C. is a compromise between 397 and 407 that was believed to be "safe" by German Sinologist Alfred Forke. Professor Tao Jiang still used it modernly in his 2021 dissertation; sometimes the birth date is simply left out.

Although Shen Buhai is recorded in Sima Qian's ''Historical Records'' as becoming Chancellor in Marquis Chao's eight year, traditionally 351, Creel suggests it more probable to date both Shen Buhai's appointment and the Marquis eighth year earlier, in 354, after the state of Wei sieged the state of Chao. As an earlier source, the ''[[Stratagems of the Warring States]]'' state that Shen Buhai had just found favor with the Marquis at the time of that event.<ref>Creel, Herrlee Glessner. 1974 p.21-23 Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B.C.
* Tao Jiang p232.</ref>

==Shenzi==
Shen was known for his cryptic writing style. Because the writings attributed to him appear to be pre-Han dynasty, he is credited with writing a now extinct two chapter text, the ''Shenzi'' ({{lang|zh|申子}}), which is concerned almost exclusively with the philosophy of governmental administration. In 141 BC, under the influence of Confucians, the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] saw Shen Buhai's name listed along with other thinkers classed as "Legalist" ([[Fajia]], with the early English term more comparable to [[Shang Yang]]), officially banning their ideas from the government; from that point on, scholarship relating to Shen's ideas went into a steep decline, despite continued use of his foundational ideas in administration (much of which, consisting of skill and report checking, would be unavoidable).

Widely read in Han times, in comparison to the still-complete [[Han Feizi]] the Shenzi was listed as lost by the [[Liang dynasty]] (502–556). Appearing again in the bibliographies of both Tang histories, its only traces remain as quotes in surviving texts in ''Qunshu Zhiyao'', compiled in 631, and ''Yilin'', compiled around 786. During the [[Qing Dynasty]], three major attempts were made to reconstruct the contents of the work, the last mention occurring in 1616, and in a library catalogue from 1700.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Creel |first=Herrlee Glessner |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&pg=PA62 |title=What Is Taoism?: And Other Studies in Chinese Cultural History |date=1982-09-15 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-12047-8 |language=en}}</ref> Its fragments were re-assembled by [[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee G. Creel]] (1974) in Shen Pu-Hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B. C., which were still used more modernly by Korean scholar Soon-Ja Yang in her review of Shen Buhai.{{sfn|Jiang|2021|pp=240}}

==Philosophy==
[[File:EN-HAN260BCE.jpg|thumbnail|]]
Though not unifying the laws of the early [[Hann state]], as [[Shang Yang]] did in the Qin, what Shen "appears to have realized" is that the "methods for the control of a bureaucracy" could not be mixed with feudal government, or staffed merely by "getting together a group of 'good men,'" but rather must be men qualified in their jobs. Unlike Shang Yang, Shen therefore emphasizes the importance of selecting able officials as much as Confucius did, but insists on "constant vigilance over their performance," never mentioning virtue. 

Shen insisted that the ruler must be fully informed on the state of his realm, but couldn't afford to get caught up in details – and does not, Creel says, have the time to do so, eschewing personal appointments. The way to see and hear independently is by grouping particulars into categories through mechanical or operational decision-making (Fa or "method").

However, in comparison with the later, more mechanically developed [[Han Fei]], his system still required a strong ruler, emphasizing that he trust no one minister. Shen's ruler had the widest possible sovereignty, was intelligent (if not a sage), had to make all crucial decisions himself, and had unlimited control of the bureaucracy - over which, in contrast to Shang Yang, he is simply the head. Championing ''Fa'' (法 "method"), Shen believed that the greatest threat to a ruler's power came from within, and unlike Han Fei, never preaches to his ministers about duty or loyalty.<ref>Creel 1970 p.63,65,81,86.

Shen Buhai's doctrines, posthumously referred to by Han Fei as Shu or Technique (a term Shen may not have used), are described as concerned almost exclusively with the "ruler's role and the methods by which he may control a bureaucracy," that is, its management and personnel control: the selection of capable ministers, their performance, the monopolization of power, and the control of and relations between ruler and minister which he characterized as [[Wu wei|Wu Wei]]. They can therefore easily be considered the most crucial element in controlling a bureaucracy.<ref>Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 81, 100,103</ref><ref name="Chad Hansen p.359"/><ref>Xuezhi Guo 2001, p.142, The Ideal Chinese Political Leader</ref>

The logician [[Deng Xi]] (died 501 BCE) is cited by Liu Xiang for the origin of the principle of Xing-Ming. Serving as a minor official in the state of [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], he is reported to have drawn up a code of penal laws. Associated with litigation, he is said to have argued for the permissibility of contradictory propositions, likely engaging in hair-splitting debates on the interpretation of laws, legal principles and definitions.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cua |first=Antonio S. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTv_AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA492 |title=Encyclopedia of Chinese Philosophy |date=2013-11-05 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-36748-0 |language=en}}</ref>

Shen Buhai solves this through [[Wu wei]], or not getting involved, making an official's words his own responsibility.<ref name="Makeham, J. 1990 p.91">{{Cite journal |last=Makeham |first=John |date=1990 |title=THE LEGALIST CONCEPT OF HSING-MING: An Example of the Contribution of Archaeological Evidence to the Re-Interpretation of Transmitted Texts |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40726902 |journal=Monumenta Serica |volume=39 |pages=87–114 |issn=0254-9948}}</ref> Shen Buhai says, "The ruler controls the policy, the ministers manage affairs.

Disputers of the Tao. https://books.google.com/books?id=QBzyCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA283</ref> using ming-shih for investigation and appointment, but the legal system of Han was apparently confused, prohibiting uniform reward and punishment.

{{further|Wu wei}}
Following Shen, [[Han Fei]] strongly advocated [[Wu wei]]. During the Han dynasty up until the reign of [[Han Wudi]], rulers confined their activity "chiefly to the appointment and dismissal of his high officials," a plainly "Legalist" practice inherited from the [[Qin dynasty]].<ref>Creel 1970 p.99. What Is Taoism? https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&pg=PA99</ref> This "conception of the ruler's role as a supreme arbiter, who keeps the essential power firmly in his grasp" while leaving details to ministers, has a "deep influence on the theory and practice of Chinese monarchy."

Shen Buhai argued that if the government were organized and supervised relying on proper method (Fa), the ruler need do little—and must do little.<ref>Creel 1970 p.69,99. What Is Taoism? https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&pg=PA69

However, Shen still believed that the ruler's most able ministers are his greatest danger,<ref>Creel, 1974 p.35 Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B.C.</ref> and is convinced that it is impossible to make them loyal without techniques.<ref>Xuezhi Go, 2002. p.143 The Ideal Chinese Political Leader.</ref> Creel explains: "The ruler's subjects are so numerous, and so on alert to discover his weaknesses and get the better of him, that it is hopeless for him alone as one man to try to learn their characteristics and control them by his knowledge... the ruler must refrain from taking the initiative, and from making himself conspicuous--and therefore vulnerable--by taking any overt action."<ref>Creel 1970 p.67. What Is Taoism? https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&pg=PA67</ref>

Emphasizing the use of administrative methods (Fa) in secrecy, Shen Buhai portrays the ruler as putting up a front to hide his weaknesses and dependence on his advisers.<ref>Karyn Lai 2017. p.171. An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=3M1WDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA171</ref> Shen therefore advises the ruler to keep his own counsel, hide his motivations, and conceal his tracks in inaction, availing himself of an appearance of stupidity and insufficiency.

This Wu wei (or nonaction) might be said to end up the political theory of the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|"Legalists,"]] if not becoming their general term for political strategy, playing a "crucial role in the promotion of the autocratic tradition of the Chinese polity." The (qualified) non-action of the ruler ensures his power and the stability of the polity.<ref>Xuezhi Go, 2002. p.198 The Ideal Chinese Political Leader.</ref>

====Yin (passive mindfulness)====
A commentary to the Shiji cites a now-lost book, quoting as Shen Buhai saying: "By employing (yin), 'passive mindfulness', in overseeing and keeping account of his vassals, accountability is deeply engraved." The Guanzi similarly says: "Yin is the way of non-action. Yin is neither to add to nor to detract from anything. To give something a name strictly on the basis of its form – this is the Method of yin." Yin aimed at concealing the ruler's intentions, likes and opinions. Despite such injunctions, it is clear that the ruler's assignments would still be completely up to him.<ref>John Makeham 1994 p.&nbsp;69.

[[Sinologist]] [[John Makeham]] explains: "assessing words and deeds requires the ruler's dispassionate attention; (yin is) the skill or technique of making one's mind a tabula rasa, non-committaly taking note of all the details of a man's claims and then objectively comparing his achievements of the original claims." Adherence to the use of technique in governing requires the ruler not engage in any interference or subjective consideration.

Originally credited by Creel as syncretic precedent for Shen Buhai's Han dynasty association within the [[Fajia]], Chapter 43 of the ''[[Han Feizi]]'' says:
{{Blockquote | Now [[Shen Buhai]] spoke about the need of Shu (fa-shu "Method" or "Technique") and [[Shang Yang]] practices the use of Fa ("Standards" as including law). What is called Shu is to create posts according to responsibilities, hold actual services accountable according to official titles, exercise the power over life and death, and examine the abilities of all his ministers; these are the things that the ruler keeps in his own hand. Fa includes mandates and ordinances promulgated to the government offices, penalties that are definite in the mind of the people, rewards that are due to the careful observers of standards, and punishments that are inflicted upon those who violate orders. It is what the subjects and ministers take as a model. If the ruler is without Shu he will be overshadowed; if the subjects and ministers lack Fa they will be insubordinate. Thus, neither can be dispensed with: both are implements of emperors and kings.}}
Although Shu technique appears in the Shen Buhai fragments, Creel would argue that it had not evolved in yet Shen Buhai's time, considering their fragments as representing a later interpolation. It's question is a point of contention for the nature of Shen Buhai.<Ref>Thomas A. Metzger 1976 p18. Ultimate Wisdom or Applied Psychology?</ref> As would not be unique, [[Edward L. Shaughnessy]] glosses Shen Buhai under Han Fei's Shu. He does not interpret him along Han Fei lines, but others have simply glossed Shen Buhai along Han Fei lines, with the tactics and trickery of the Han Feizi's later chapters, and even the harsh laws of Shang Yang. But, they would not appear to present any academic argument available in the English language.

===Legalist speculations===
Sinologist Hansen (1992), current of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia]] of Daoism, recalls Benjamin Schwarz (1985) as citing Han Fei's two handles of punishment and reward as clearly part of Shu, in rebuttal to Creel's insistence that Shen Buhai was not a Legalist. As at least illustrative of Han Fei, Hansen focuses on Shu "method" or "technique" as safeguarding the ruler's power to punish and reward, which must be kept in his hands, that punishment and reward can not be meted out without the ruler's approval, or that persons are immune to it. 

As compared with Shang Yang, the thrust of the more administrative Shu is not the establishment of fa as codified law. Rather, relying on fa (objective standards), the ruler ought at least not mete out reward or punishment on mere recommendation or fame. A monopoly over reward and punishment does not itself make Shen Buhai or his ruler a Shang Yangian Legalist, even if Han Fei advocates it. Hence, Creel would argue that Han Fei does not himself consider Shen Buhai a Shang Yangian Legalist (although the concept of Legalist did not exist yet.)

Whether it was itself relying on the Han Feizi's account or not, the [[Huainanzi]] says that when Shen Buhai lived, the officials of the state of Han were at cross-purposes and did not know what practices to follow. Shaughnessy points out that Shen Buhai would have at least been aware of [[Li Kui (legalist)|Li Kui]]'s book of law, as Shang Yang's predecessor. Taking Li Kui as a hypothetical influence, Shaughnessy only suggests Shen Buhai as similar in the sense of attempting to implement a more meritocratic government. 

Tao Jiang notes Korean scholar Soon-Ja Yang as still relying on Creel's fragments, taking the "absence of Shu much more seriously." Opposing Han Fei's comparison of him with Shang Yang, in favour of a more Confucian-Legalist interpretation, she interpolates a universal registry along the lines of the Confucian [[rectification of names]]. Not specifically endorsing the interpretation, Tao Jiang takes her as illustrative of Creel, namely that Shen Buhai does not follow Han Fei's (significantly later) broader doctrine, but rather as aiming at a cooperative, impartial government along Creel lines.<ref>

===Daoist speculations===
Lacking metaphysical connotation, Shen used the term [[Wu wei]] in an earlier, more Confucian sense to mean that the ruler, though vigilant, should not interfere with the duties of his ministers. With earlier modern scholars suggesting that Shen's statecraft blended with [[Daoism]], sinnce the bulk of the [[Tao Te Ching]] appeared to have  been composed later, Creel argued that it might therefore be assumed that Shen influenced instead the Tao Te Ching.<ref>Creel 1970 p.62-63.

Chinese Thought: An Introduction https://books.google.com/books?id=-E5LZeR7QKwC&pg=PA92</ref> With Wu wei having a broader ancient mileu than Shen Buhai, Creel's argument does not appear to have been "entirely convincing" in the west.<ref>Stringerland 2003. Effortless Action p11</ref>

Michael's Loewe's Cambridge History of China still refers to the [[Fajia]] loosely as early Daoistic thinkers.<ref>Loewe 1999, p. 1008</ref>

===Legacy===
Considering Creel correct to distinguish between the stands of 'Legalism', [[Michael Loewe]], in the Cambridge History of China, argued for their complementarity. Han Fei called both branches "the instruments of Kings and Emperors," and Li Si praises them equally, finding no contradiction between them. If he was influential in it, Loewe supposes that Shen Buhai's influence may have made Qin government more sophisticated and reasonable, as it appeared, than could be expected of the dogma of the Book of Lord Shang alone. Questioning the thrust of tracing lineages between the personas, Loewe characterizes Han dynasty persons potentially influenced by Shen Buhai as sympathizers of imperial government over that of the small states, endeavoring to permanently establish imperial government without the dangers that destroyed the Qin.<ref>Michael Loewe 1978/1986. p74. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A2HKxK5N2sAC&pg=PA74 The Cambridge History of China Volume I: Ch'in and Han Empires]'', 221 B.C. -- A.D. 220.</ref>

Creel elaborates a number of figures influenced potentially by Shen Buhai. These include Emperor [[Qinshihuang]], Han figures [[Jia Yi]], [[Emperor Wen of Han]], [[Emperor Jing of Han]], [[Chao Cuo]], [[Dong Zhongshu]], [[Gongsun Hong]], and [[Emperor Xuan of Han]], and [[Emperor Wen of Sui]]. Although a Confucian-oriented minister, [[Zhuge Liang]] is noted (by others) as attaching great importance to the work of Han Fei and Shen Buhai. Emperor [[Qinshihuang]] erected an inscription naming himself as taking control of the government and for the first time establishing Xing-Ming, as retroactive terminology for Shen Buhai's method.

The [[Shiji]] records [[Li Si]] as repeatedly recommending "supervising and holding responsible," which he attributed to Shen Buhai. A stele set up by [[Qin Shi Huang]] memorializes him as a sage that, taking charge of the government, established Xing-Ming. The Shiji states that [[Emperor Wen of Han]] was "basically fond of Xing-Ming." 

The scholar [[Jia Yi]] advised Wen to teach his heir to use Shen Buhai's method, so as to be able to "supervise the functions of the many officials and understand the usages of government." Bringing together Confucian and Daoist discourses, Jia Yi describes Shen Buhai's Shu as a particular method of applying the Dao, or virtue. He uses the imagery of the [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] of the knife and hatchet as examples of skillful technique in both virtue and force, saying "benevolence, righteousness, kindness and generosity are the ruler's sharp knife. Power, purchase, law and regulation are his axe and hatchet." Two advisors to Wen's heir, [[Emperor Jing of Han]] were students of Xing-Ming, one passing the highest grade of examination, and admonished Jing for not using it on the feudal lords.

By the time of the civil service examination was put into place, Confucian influence saw outright discussion of Shen Buhai banned. However, the Emperor under which it was founded, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], was both familiar with and favorable to Legalist ideas, and the civil service examination did not come into existence until its support by [[Gongsun Hong]], who wrote a book on Xing-Ming. The [[Emperor Xuan of Han]] was still said by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] to have been fond of reading Shen Buhai, using Xing-Ming to control his subordinates and devoting much time to legal cases.

Heir successor [[Emperor Jing of Han]] also had two mentors in the doctrines of Shen Buhai, and appointed another Legalist, [[Chao Cuo]]. Chao Cuo is regarded by the [[Hanshu]] as a student of the doctrines of Shen Buhai, Shang Yang and Xing-Ming. Unlike Jia Yi, he does appear to take interest in Shang Yang. Following the Rebellion of the Seven Kingdoms, Emperor Jing reformed criminal penalties to reduce injustices and punishments.

An advocate for the civil service examinations, [[Dong Zhongshu]]'s writings on personnel testing and control uses Ming-shih in a manner "hardly distinguishable" from the Han Feizi, but unlike Han Fei, advocate against punishments. Dong's advocacy aside, the civil service examination did not come into existence until its support by [[Gongsun Hong]], who wrote a book on ''xingming''. Thus, Creel credits the origination of the civil service examination in part to Shen Buhai.

The Emperor Xuan of Han was still said by Liu Xiang to have been fond of reading Shen Buhai, using Xing-Ming to control his subordinates and devoting much time to legal cases. Regarded as being in opposition to Confucians, as Confucianism ascended the term disappeared. As early as the Eastern Han its full and original meaning would be forgotten. Yet, it appears in later dynasties, and [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] is recorded as having withdrawn his favour from the Confucians, giving it to "the group advocating Xing-Ming and authoritarian government."<ref>Legacy
