'''Isaac of Stella''', O.Cart, also referred to as '''Isaac de l'Étoile''', (c. 1100, in [[England]] &ndash; c. 1170s, Étoile, [[Archigny]], [[France]]) was a [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] (and later [[Carthusians|Carthusian]]) monk, theologian and philosopher.

==Life==
Born in England, after studies in Paris, he entered the [[Order of Cistercians]], probably at Pontigny, during the reforms of Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]. In 1147 he became [[abbot]] of the small [[monastery]] of Stella, outside Poitiers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_0HSCa2PkAcC&dq=Isaac+of+Stella&pg=PT299 Matarasso, Pauline. ''The Cistercian World: Monastic Writings of the Twelfth Century'', Penguin UK, 2006]{{ISBN|9780141960722}}</ref>

At some time in his later life, most probably in 1167, he left Stella to set up a monastery on the [[Île de Ré]] on the Atlantic coast.<ref>[http://www.catholicbooksreview.org/2020/stella.html O'Connell, Patrick F., Review of "Isaac of Stella. Sermons on the Christian Year", Catholic Books Review, 2019]</ref> He later returned to Stella, where it is known that he lived into the 1170s since in one of his sermons he refers to meeting 'Saint' Bernard - and Bernard was only canonised in 1174.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Growth of Mysticism'', p286</ref>

Isaac's most popular work was an allegorical commentary on the canon of the Mass in the form  of a letter to [[John of Canterbury]], bishop of Poitiers. His 55 surviving sermons (and three sermon fragments),<ref>These have been edited in the series ''Sources chrétiennes'' nos 130, 207, 339 as ''Isaac de l'Ètoile: Sermons'', and partly in the series ''Fontes Christiani'' (Band 52:1; 52,2).</ref> as well as his ''Letter to Alcher on the Soul'', constitute his real theological contribution. The ''Letter'' (1962) was addressed to [[Alcher of Clairvaux]], and combined [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and Neoplatonic theories about psychology with Christian mysticism. It exercised a significant role in later mystical speculation due to the incorporation of large sections of Isaac's work in the anthropological compendium known as ''De spiritu et anima'' (''The Spirit and the Soul''), which circulated under the name of Augustine and was widely used in the 13th century.<ref>McGinn, ''Growth'', p286. It appears under the name of Augustine in PL 40:779-832 (McGinn, ''Growth'', p544). An English translation exists in B. McGinn (tr), ''Three Treatises on Man: A Cistercian Anthropology'', (Kalamazoo, MI: Cistercian Publications, 1977). It in fact seems to be a compilation by a Cistercian, and to date from the 1170s.</ref>

Isaac's works make use of logical argumentation, influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s [[Neoplatonism]].
