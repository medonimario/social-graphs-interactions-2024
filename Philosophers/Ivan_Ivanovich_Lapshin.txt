'''Ivan Ivanovich Lapshin''' (11 October 1870 – 17 November 1952) was a Russian philosopher, publicist, translator and teacher.

==Biography==
Lapshin was born on 11 October in [[Moscow]]. He graduated with his Masters from the Faculty of History and Philology of [[Saint Petersburg State University|St. Petersburg University]], where he worked mainly under the guidance of Professor Alexander Ivanovich Vvedensky<small>([[:ru:Введенский, Александр Иванович (философ)|rus]])</small>.

In the autumn of 1892, he presented his first major work, The Controversy between [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] on the Meditation (300 pages), for consideration at the faculty. In 1893, at the end of the course, he was left at the university at the department of philosophy "to prepare for a professorship."

He taught logic at the Alexander Lyceum, psychology at women's gymnasiums; the history of pedagogical theories at higher women's and military pedagogical courses. In 1906, he was awarded a Doctorate in Philosophy with his dissertation, "The Laws of Thought and Forms of Cognition."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Лапшин Иван Иванович |url=https://bioslovhist.spbu.ru/person/420-lapshin-ivan-ivanovich.html |access-date=2023-07-13 |website=bioslovhist.spbu.ru}}</ref>
