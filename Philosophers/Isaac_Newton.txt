'''Sir Isaac Newton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|FRS}} (25 December 1642&nbsp;– 20 March 1726/27<!-- This is the generally accepted manner of recording Newton's death date.

At Newton's birth, Gregorian dates were ten days ahead of Julian dates; thus, his birth is recorded as taking place on 25 December 1642 Old Style, but it can be converted to a New Style (modern) date of 4 January 1643. By the time of his death, the difference between the calendars had increased to eleven days. Moreover, he died in the period after the start of the New Style year on 1 January but before that of the Old Style new year on 25 March. His death occurred on 20 March 1726, according to the Old Style calendar, but the year is usually adjusted to 1727.

Newton was a fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] and the second [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. He refused to take [[holy orders]] in the [[Church of England]], unlike most members of the Cambridge faculty of the day. Beyond his work on the [[mathematical sciences]], Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of [[alchemy]] and [[Chronology of the Bible|biblical chronology]], but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig party]], Newton served two brief terms as [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge]], in 1689–1690 and 1701–1702. He was [[knight]]ed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as [[Warden of the Mint|Warden]] (1696–1699) and [[Master of the Mint|Master]] (1699–1727) of the [[Royal Mint]], as well as president of the [[Royal Society]] (1703–1727).

== Early life ==
{{Main|Early life of Isaac Newton}}
Isaac Newton was born (according to the [[Julian calendar]] in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]] 4 January 1643{{efn|name=OSNS}}) at [[Woolsthorpe Manor]] in [[Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth]], a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the county of Lincolnshire.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hatch |first=Robert&nbsp;A. |date=1988 |title=Sir Isaac Newton |url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu//ufhatch/pages/01-courses/current-courses/08sr-newton.htm |access-date=13 June 2023 |archive-date=5 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221105011958/http://users.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/pages/01-Courses/current-courses/08sr-newton.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before. [[premature birth|Born prematurely]], Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a [[quart]] mug.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Storr |first=Anthony |author-link=Anthony Storr |date=December 1985 |title=Isaac Newton |journal=British Medical Journal (Clinical Research Edition) |volume=291 |issue=6511 |pages=1779–84 |doi=10.1136/bmj.291.6511.1779 |jstor=29521701 |pmc=1419183 |pmid=3936583}}</ref> When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (née Blythe). Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: "Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Keynes |first=Milo |date=20 September 2008 |title=Balancing Newton's Mind: His Singular Behaviour and His Madness of 1692–93 |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=289–300 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2007.0025 |jstor=20462679 |pmid=19244857 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Newton's mother had three children (Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah) from her second marriage.{{sfn|Westfall|1980|p=55}}

=== The King's School ===
From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at [[The King's School, Grantham|The King's School]] in [[Grantham]], which taught [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics.<ref>"Newton the Mathematician" Z. Bechler, ed., Contemporary Newtonian Research(Dordrecht 1982) pp. 110–111</ref> He was removed from school by his mother and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659. His mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated.{{sfn|Westfall|1994|pp=16–19}} Henry Stokes, master at The King's School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student,{{sfn|White|1997|p=22}} distinguishing himself mainly by building [[sundial]]s and models of windmills.{{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=60–62}}

=== University of Cambridge ===
In June 1661, Newton was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His uncle the Reverend William Ayscough, who had studied at Cambridge, recommended him to the university. At Cambridge, Newton started as a [[subsizar]], paying his way by performing [[valet]] duties until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, which covered his university costs for four more years until the completion of his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]].{{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=71, 103}} At the time, Cambridge's teachings were based on those of [[Aristotle]], whom Newton read along with then more modern philosophers, including [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[astronomer]]s such as [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Thomas Street (astronomer)|Thomas Street]]. He set down in his notebook a series of "[[Quaestiones quaedam philosophicae|''Quaestiones'']]" about [[mechanical philosophy]] as he found it. In 1665, he discovered the generalised [[binomial theorem]] and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became [[calculus]]. Soon after Newton obtained his BA degree at Cambridge in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Newton, Sir Isaac |volume=19 |page=583 |first=Henry Martyn |last=Taylor}}</ref>

Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cambridge Illustrated History of Astronomy |date=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-41158-5 |editor-last=Hoskins |editor-first=Michael |page=159}}</ref> Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the next two years saw the development of his theories on calculus,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Newton |first=Isaac |title=Waste Book |url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-04004 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108205159/http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-04004/ |archive-date=8 January 2012 |access-date=10 January 2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Digital Library}}</ref> [[optics]], and the [[law of gravitation]].<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" />

In April 1667, Newton returned to the University of Cambridge, and in October he was elected as a fellow of Trinity.<ref>{{acad|id=NWTN661I|name=Newton, Isaac}}</ref>{{sfn|Westfall|1980|p=178}} Fellows were required to take [[holy orders]] and be ordained as [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priests, although this was not enforced in the [[Stuart Restoration|Restoration]] years, and an assertion of conformity to the [[Church of England]] was sufficient. He made the commitment that "I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [7&nbsp;years] arrives, or I will resign from the college."{{sfn|Westfall|1980|p=179}} Up until this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the [[Thirty-nine Articles]], the basis of Church of England doctrine. By 1675 the issue could not be avoided, and by then his unconventional views stood in the way.{{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=330–331}}

His academic work impressed the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian professor]] [[Isaac Barrow]], who was anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity College two years later); in 1669, Newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his MA. The terms of the Lucasian professorship required that the holder {{em|not}} be active in the church – presumably{{weasel inline|date=December 2018}} to leave more time for science. Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], whose permission was needed, accepted this argument; thus, a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.{{sfn|White|1997|p=151}}

Newton's work has been said "to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied".{{sfn|Ball|1908|p=319}} His work on the subject, usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton's mathematical papers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Newton |first1=Isaac |editor1-last=Whiteside |editor1-first=Derek Thomas |title=The Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton Volume 1 from 1664 to 1666 |date=1967 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-05817-9 |page=400 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/MathematicsIsaacNewtonVol1_1664-66Whiteside1967/MathematicsIsaacNewtonVol1_1664-66Whiteside1967_144x75/page/400/mode/1up |chapter=The October 1666 tract on fluxions}}</ref> His work ''[[De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas]]'', sent by [[Isaac Barrow]] to [[John Collins (mathematician)|John Collins]] in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins that August as the work "of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things".{{sfn|Gjertsen|1986|p=149}} Newton later [[Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy|became involved in a dispute]] with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] over priority in the development of calculus.

Newton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism.{{sfn|Stewart|2009|p=107}} He was close to the Swiss mathematician [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]]. In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton's ''Principia'', and corresponded with Leibniz.{{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=538–539}} In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stern |first=Keith |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/317453194 |title=Queers in history : the comprehensive encyclopedia of historical gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgenders |date=2009 |publisher=BenBella |isbn=978-1-933771-87-8 |location=Dallas, Tex. |oclc=317453194 |access-date=30 November 2022 |archive-date=26 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240226144340/https://search.worldcat.org/title/317453194 |url-status=live }}</ref> Starting in 1699, other members{{who|date=December 2018}} of the [[Royal Society]] accused Leibniz of plagiarism.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nowlan |first=Robert |title=Masters of Mathematics: The Problems They Solved, Why These Are Important, and What You Should Know about Them |publisher=Sense Publishers |year=2017 |isbn=978-94-6300-891-4 |location=Rotterdam |page=136}}</ref> The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud; it was later found that Newton wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz.

Newton is generally credited with the [[Binomial theorem#Newton's generalized binomial theorem|generalised binomial theorem]], valid for any exponent. He discovered [[Newton's identities]], [[Newton's method]], classified [[cubic plane curve]]s ([[polynomials]] of degree three in two [[variable (mathematics)|variables]]), made substantial contributions to the theory of [[finite differences]], and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ [[coordinate geometry]] to derive solutions to [[Diophantine equations]]. He approximated [[series (mathematics)|partial]] sums of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] by [[logarithms]] (a precursor to [[Euler's summation formula]]) and was the first to use [[power series]] with confidence and to revert power series. Newton's work on infinite series was inspired by [[Simon Stevin]]'s decimals.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Błaszczyk |first1=P. |last2=Katz |first2=M.&nbsp;G. |author-link2=Mikhail Katz |last3=Sherry |first3=D. |display-authors=1 |date=March 2013 |title=Ten misconceptions from the history of analysis and their debunking |journal=[[Foundations of Science]] |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=43–74 |arxiv=1202.4153 |doi=10.1007/s10699-012-9285-8 |s2cid=119134151}}</ref>

In 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a [[Triangular prism (optics)|prism]] in the position of [[minimum deviation]] is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.<ref name="Whittaker" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Darrigol |first=Olivier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ye_1AAAAQBAJ&pg=PAPA81 |title=A History of Optics from Greek Antiquity to the Nineteenth Century |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-964437-7 |page=81 |access-date=1 December 2018 |archive-date=26 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240226144911/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ye_1AAAAQBAJ&pg=PAPA81#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light – a point which had, until then, been a matter of debate.

From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Newton |first=Isaac |title=Hydrostatics, Optics, Sound and Heat |url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03970/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108215515/http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03970/ |archive-date=8 January 2012 |access-date=10 January 2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Digital Library}}</ref> During this period he investigated the [[refraction]] of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured image produced by a prism, which he named a [[spectrum]], could be recomposed into white light by a [[lens (optics)|lens]] and a second prism.{{sfn|Ball|1908|p=324}} Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscular]] alchemy.<ref>[[William R. Newman]], "Newton's Early Optical Theory and its Debt to Chymistry", in Danielle Jacquart and Michel Hochmann, eds., ''Lumière et vision dans les sciences et dans les arts'' (Geneva: Droz, 2010), pp. 283–307.

He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as [[Early life of Isaac Newton#Newton's theory of colour|Newton's theory of colour]].{{sfn|Ball|1908|p=325}}

[[File:Dispersive Prism Illustration.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a [[dispersive prism]] separating white light into the colours of the spectrum, as discovered by Newton]]

From this work, he concluded that the lens of any [[refracting telescope]] would suffer from the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of light into colours ([[chromatic aberration]]). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the [[objective (optics)|objective]] to bypass that problem.<ref name="The Early Period (1608–1672)" /><ref name="White 1997, p170" /> Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a [[Newtonian telescope]],<ref name="White 1997, p170" /> involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective [[speculum metal]], using [[Newton's rings]] to judge the [[quality (philosophy)|quality]] of the optics for his telescopes. In late 1668,<ref name="books.google.com" /> he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope.{{sfn|White|1997|p=168}} Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, ''Of Colours'',<ref>{{Cite web |last=Newton |first=Isaac |title=Of Colours |url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/NATP00004 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009051407/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/NATP00004 |archive-date=9 October 2014 |access-date=6 October 2014 |website=The Newton Project}}</ref> which he later expanded into the work ''[[Opticks]]''. When [[Robert Hooke]] criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions,<ref name="hooke1679nov24" /> which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.<ref>Iliffe, Robert (2007) Newton. A very short introduction, Oxford University Press 2007</ref>

[[File:Newton-letter-to-briggs 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Facsimile of a 1682 letter from Newton to [[William Briggs (physician)|William Briggs]], commenting on Briggs' ''A New Theory of Vision'']]

Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (''Opticks'' Bk. II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] patterns and the general phenomenon of [[diffraction]]. Today's [[quantum mechanics]], [[photons]], and the idea of [[wave–particle duality]] bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.

In his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the [[luminiferous aether|ether]] to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the [[Cambridge Platonists|Cambridge Platonist]] philosopher [[Henry More]] revived his interest in alchemy.<ref name="More" /> He replaced the ether with occult forces based on [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. [[John Maynard Keynes]], who acquired many of Newton's writings on alchemy, stated that "Newton was not the first of the age of reason: He was the last of the magicians."<ref name="The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes Volume X" /> Newton's contributions to science cannot be isolated from his interest in alchemy.<ref name="More" /> This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science.{{cn|date=March 2024}}

In 1704, Newton published ''[[Opticks]]'', in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation "Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another,&nbsp;... and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?"<ref name="Newton's Alchemy and His Theory of Matter" /> Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional [[electrostatic generator]], using a glass globe.<ref>Opticks, 2nd Ed 1706. Query 8.</ref>

In his book ''Opticks'', Newton was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander, and also the use of multiple-prism arrays.<ref name="OPN1" /> Some 278 years after Newton's discussion, [[beam expander#Multiple-prism beam expanders|multiple-prism beam expanders]] became central to the development of [[laser linewidth|narrow-linewidth]] [[tunable laser]]s. Also, the use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the [[multiple-prism dispersion theory]].<ref name=OPN1 />

Subsequent to Newton, much has been amended. [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]] and [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Fresnel]] discarded Newton's particle theory in favour of [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens']] wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light's wavelength. Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. The German poet and scientist, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], could not shake the Newtonian foundation but "one hole Goethe did find in Newton's armour,&nbsp;... Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He, therefore, thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must forever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by [[John Dollond|Dollond]] to be wrong."<ref>Tyndall, John. (1880). ''Popular Science Monthly'' Volume 17, July.

Newton communicated his results to [[Edmond Halley]] and to the Royal Society in {{lang|la|[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]}}, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684.<ref>Whiteside, D.T., ed. (1974). ''Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton, 1684–1691''. '''6'''. Cambridge University Press. p.&nbsp;30.</ref> This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the ''Principia''.

The {{lang|la|[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]}} was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Halley. In this work, Newton stated the [[Newton's laws of motion|three universal laws of motion]]. Together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for [[classical mechanics]]. They contributed to many advances during the [[Industrial Revolution]] which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advances continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word ''gravitas'' (weight) for the effect that would become known as [[gravity]], and defined the law of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]].<ref name="Schmitz2018">{{Cite book |last=Schmitz |first=Kenneth&nbsp;S. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WGdBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA251 |title=Physical Chemistry: Multidisciplinary Applications in Society |publisher=Elsevier |year=2018 |isbn=978-0-12-800599-6 |location=Amsterdam |page=251 |access-date=1 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200310132426/https://books.google.com/books?id=4WGdBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA251 |archive-date=10 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave the first analytical determination (based on [[Boyle's law]]) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth's spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon's gravitational attraction on the Earth's oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the [[Lunar theory#Newton|irregularities in the motion of the Moon]], provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.<ref name="Schmitz2018" /> Newton's biographer [[David Brewster]] reported that the complexity of applying his theory of gravity to the motion of the moon was so great it affected Newton's health: "[H]e was deprived of his appetite and sleep" during his work on the problem in 1692–93, and told the astronomer [[John Machin]] that "his head never ached but when he was studying the subject". According to Brewster, [[Edmund Halley]] also told [[John Conduitt]] that when pressed to complete his analysis Newton "always replied that it made his head ache, and ''kept him awake so often, that he would think of it no more''".

Newton made clear his [[heliocentric]] view of the Solar System—developed in a somewhat modern way because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the "deviation of the Sun" from the centre of gravity of the Solar System.<ref>See Curtis Wilson, "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", pp. 233–274 in R Taton & C Wilson (eds) (1989) ''The General History of Astronomy'', Volume, 2A', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&pg=PA233 at p. 233] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003121307/https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&pg=PA233 |date=3 October 2015 }}.</ref> For Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather "the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World", and this centre of gravity "either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line". (Newton adopted the "at rest" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest.)<ref>Text quotations are from 1729 translation of Newton's ''Principia'', Book 3 (1729 vol.2) [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_6EqxPav3vIsC/page/n257 at pp. 232–33 &#91;233&#93;].</ref>

Newton was criticised for introducing "[[occult]] agencies" into science because of his postulate of an invisible [[action at a distance (physics)|force able to act over vast distances]].<ref>Edelglass et al., ''Matter and Mind'', {{isbn|0-940262-45-2}}. p. 54</ref> Later, in the second edition of the ''Principia'' (1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding [[General Scholium]], writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here Newton used what became his famous expression {{lang|la|"[[Hypotheses non fingo]]"}}.<ref>On the meaning and origins of this expression, see Kirsten Walsh, [https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2010/10/does-newton-feign-an-hypothesis/ Does Newton feign an hypothesis?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714120054/https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2010/10/does-newton-feign-an-hypothesis/ |date=14 July 2014 }}, [https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/ Early Modern Experimental Philosophy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721051523/https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/ |date=21 July 2011 }}, 18 October 2010.</ref>)

With the {{lang|la|Principia}}, Newton became internationally recognised.{{sfn|Westfall|1980|loc=Chapter 11}} He acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]].<ref name="Hatch">{{Cite web |last=Hatch |first=Professor Robert&nbsp;A. |title=Newton Timeline |url=http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/ufhatch/pages/13-NDFE/newton/05-newton-timeline-m.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802071026/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/ufhatch/pages/13-NDFE/newton/05-newton-timeline-m.htm |archive-date=2 August 2012 |access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref>

In 1710, Newton found 72 of the 78 "species" of cubic curves and categorised them into four types.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bloye |first1=Nicole |last2=Huggett |first2=Stephen |year=2011 |title=Newton, the geometer |url=https://stephenhuggett.com/Newton.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society |issue=82 |pages=19–27 |mr=2896438 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230308041757/http://stephenhuggett.com/Newton.pdf |archive-date=8 March 2023 |access-date=19 February 2023}}</ref> In 1717, and probably with Newton's help, [[James Stirling (mathematician)|James Stirling]] proved that every cubic was one of these four types.

''[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]]'', 2nd ed., 2006, Springer Verlag.</ref>

=== Philosophy of Science ===

Starting with the second edition of his "Principia. ([[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]])," Newton included a final section on science philosophy or method.  It was here that he wrote his famous line, in Latin, "hypotheses non fingo", which can be translated as "I don't make hypotheses," (the direct translation of "fingo" is "frame", but in context he was advocating against the use of hypotheses in science).  He went on to posit that if there is no data to explain a finding, one should simply wait for that data, rather than guessing at an explanation. The full quote, translated from that section is, "Hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses, for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction. Thus it was that the impenetrability, the mobility, and the impulsive force of bodies, and the laws of motion and of gravitation, were discovered. And to us it is enough that gravity does really exist, and act according to the laws which we have explained, and abundantly serves to account for all the motions of the celestial bodies, and of our sea.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Newton |first=Sir Isaac |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-hHAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA102 |title=Newton's Principia: The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy |date=1850 |publisher=Geo.

This idea that Newton became anti-hypothesis has been disputed, since earlier editions of the Principia were in fact divided in sections headed by hypotheses.  But he clearly seems to have gone away from that, as further evidenced from his famous line in his "Opticks", where he wrote, in English, "Hypotheses have no place in experimental science."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Newton |first=Sir Isaac |title=Opticks: Opticks by Sir Isaac Newton &#124; Groundbreaking Discoveries in Optics and Light |date=January 2021 |publisher=Prabhat Prakashan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OiUDgAAQBAJ&q=Isaac+Newton,+Opticks}}|title=Newton's Opticks|date=1721</ref>

These ideas are in line with the scientific philosophy of [[Francis Bacon]], who advocated for an inductive, or data-drivien, approach to science.

In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of [[religious tracts]] dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible. A manuscript Newton sent to [[John Locke]] in which he disputed the fidelity of [[1 John 5:7]]—the [[Johannine Comma]]—and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785.<ref>{{Cite web |title=John Locke Manuscripts&nbsp;– Chronological Listing: 1690 |url=http://www.libraries.psu.edu/tas/locke/mss/c1690.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709035722/https://www.libraries.psu.edu/tas/locke/mss/c1690.html |archive-date=9 July 2017 |access-date=20 January 2013 |website=psu.edu}}; and John C.

Newton was also a member of the [[Parliament of England]] for [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] in 1689 and 1701, but according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed.{{sfn|White|1997|p=232}} He was, however, noted by Cambridge diarist [[Abraham de la Pryme]] to have rebuked students who were frightening locals by claiming that a house was haunted.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sawer |first=Patrick |date=6 September 2016 |title=What students should avoid during fresher's week (100&nbsp;years ago and now) |work=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/06/what-students-should-avoid-during-freshers-week-100-years-ago-an/ |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |access-date=7 September 2016 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/06/what-students-should-avoid-during-freshers-week-100-years-ago-an/ |archive-date=10 January 2022}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the [[Royal Mint]] during the reign of [[William III of England|King William III]] in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He took charge of England's great recoining, trod on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower, and secured the job of deputy [[comptroller]] of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley. Newton became perhaps the best-known [[Master of the Mint]] upon the death of [[Thomas Neale]] in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30&nbsp;years of his life.<ref name="Mint">{{Cite episode |title=Isaac Newton: Physicist And&nbsp;...

He retired from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercised his authority to reform the currency and punish [[Methods of coin debasement|clippers]] and counterfeiters.

As Warden, and afterwards as Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20&nbsp;percent of the coins taken in during the [[Great Recoinage of 1696]] were [[counterfeit]]. Counterfeiting was [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]], punishable by the felon being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult, but Newton proved equal to the task.{{sfn|White|1997|p=259}}

Newton was made president of the [[Royal Society]] in 1703 and an associate of the French [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des Sciences]].

=== Knighthood ===
In April 1705, Queen Anne [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] Newton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge.

As a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21&nbsp;silver shillings.<ref>[http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1701-25-mint-reports/report-1717-09-25.html ''On the Value of Gold and Silver in European Currencies and the Consequences on the Worldwide Gold- and Silver-Trade''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406191205/http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1701-25-mint-reports/report-1717-09-25.html |date=6 April 2017 }}, Sir Isaac Newton, 21 September 1717; [https://archive.org/details/numismaticser1v05royauoft "By The King, A Proclamation Declaring the Rates at which Gold shall be current in Payments"].

Newton was relatively modest about his achievements, writing in a letter to [[Robert Hooke]] in February 1676, "If I have seen further it is by [[standing on the shoulders of giants]]."<ref>Letter from Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke, 5 February 1676, as transcribed in {{Cite book |last=Maury |first=Jean-Pierre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8N5tQgAACAAJ |title=Newton: Understanding the Cosmos |publisher=Thames & Hudson |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-500-30023-7 |series="[[Découvertes Gallimard|New Horizons]]" series |location=London |translator-last=Paris |translator-first=I.&nbsp;Mark |access-date=18 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221174716/https://books.google.com/books?id=8N5tQgAACAAJ |archive-date=21 December 2020 |url-status=live |orig-year=1990}}</ref> Two writers think that the sentence, written at a time when Newton and Hooke were in dispute over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on Hooke (said to have been short and hunchbacked), rather than—or in addition to—a statement of modesty.<ref>John Gribbin (2002) ''Science: A History 1543–2001'', p. 164.</ref>{{sfn|White|1997|p=187}} On the other hand, the widely known proverb about standing on the shoulders of giants, published among others by seventeenth-century poet [[George Herbert]] (a former orator of the University of Cambridge and fellow of Trinity College) in his {{lang|la|Jacula Prudentum}} (1651), had as its main point that "a dwarf on a giant's shoulders sees farther of the two", and so its effect as an analogy would place Newton himself rather than Hooke as the 'dwarf'.

In a later memoir, Newton wrote, "I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."<ref>''Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton'' (1855) by Sir David Brewster (Volume II.

Although born into an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity,<ref name="Newton – 1">[[Richard S.

By 1672, he had started to record his theological researches in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only been available for public examination since 1972.{{sfn|Katz|1992|p=63}} Over half of what Newton wrote concerned theology and alchemy, and most has never been printed.{{sfn|Katz|1992|p=63}} His writings demonstrate an extensive knowledge of [[Early Christianity|early Church]] writings and show that in the conflict between [[Athanasius]] and [[Arius]] which defined the [[Athanasian Creed|Creed]], he took the side of Arius, the loser, who rejected the conventional view of the [[Trinity]]. Newton "recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man, who was subordinate to the Father who created him."{{sfn|Westfall|1980|p=315}} He was especially interested in prophecy, but for him, "the [[great apostasy]] was trinitarianism."{{sfn|Westfall|1980|p=321}}

Newton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement. At the last moment in 1675 he received a dispensation from the government that excused him and all future holders of the Lucasian chair.{{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=331–34}}

Worshipping [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as [[God in Christianity|God]] was, in Newton's eyes, [[idolatry]], an act he believed to be the fundamental [[sin]].{{sfn|Westfall|1994|p=124}} In 1999, historian [[Stephen Snobelen|Stephen D. Snobelen]] wrote, "Isaac Newton was a [[heresy|heretic]]. But&nbsp;... he never made a public declaration of his private faith—which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unraveling his personal beliefs."<ref name="heretic" /> Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a [[Socinian]] sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an [[Arianism|Arian]] and almost certainly an [[anti-trinitarian]].<ref name="heretic" />

Although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton's best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the Universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, "So then gravity may put the planets into motion, but without the Divine Power it could never put them into such a circulating motion, as they have about the sun".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Newton |first=Isaac |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz2FzJqaJMUC&q=%22gravity%20may%20put%20the%20planets%20into%20motion%22&pg=PA436 |title=Isaaci Newtoni Opera quae exstant omnia |date=1782 |publisher=Joannes Nichols |location=London |pages=436–37 |access-date=18 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414055022/https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz2FzJqaJMUC&q=%22gravity%20may%20put%20the%20planets%20into%20motion%22&pg=PA436 |archive-date=14 April 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Along with his scientific fame, Newton's studies of the Bible and of the early [[Church Fathers]] were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on [[textual criticism]], most notably ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]'' and ''[[s:Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel|Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John]]''.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16878 ''Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120113904/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16878 |date=20 January 2017 }} 1733</ref> He placed the crucifixion of [[Jesus Christ]] at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.<ref>John P. Meier, ''[[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus|A Marginal Jew]]'', v. 1, pp. 382–402. after narrowing the years to 30 or 33, provisionally judges 30 most likely.</ref>

He believed in a rationally [[immanent]] world, but he rejected the [[hylozoism]] implicit in [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]]. The ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. In his correspondence, Newton claimed that in writing the ''Principia'' "I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity".<ref>Newton to [[Richard Bentley]] 10 December 1692, in Turnbull et al. (1959–77), vol 3, p. 233.</ref> He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: "Such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice". But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system, due to the slow growth of instabilities.<ref>Opticks, 2nd Ed 1706. Query 31.</ref> For this, Leibniz lampooned him: "God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion."<ref>H.G. Alexander (ed) ''The Leibniz-Clarke correspondence'', [[Manchester University Press]], 1998, p. 11.</ref>

Newton's position was vigorously defended by his follower [[Samuel Clarke]] in a [[Leibniz-Clarke correspondence|famous correspondence]]. A century later, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]'s work [[Traité de mécanique céleste|''Celestial Mechanics'']] had a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Tyson |first=Neil Degrasse |author-link=Neil deGrasse Tyson |date=1 November 2005 |title=The Perimeter of Ignorance |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance |url-status=dead |journal=Natural History Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906154623/http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance |archive-date=6 September 2018 |access-date=7 January 2016}}</ref> The contrast between Laplace's mechanistic worldview and Newton's one is the most strident considering the famous answer which the French scientist gave [[Napoleon]], who had criticised him for the absence of the Creator in the ''Mécanique céleste'': "Sire, j'ai pu me passer de cette hypothèse" ("Sir, I didn't need this hypothesis").<ref>Dijksterhuis, E. J. ''The Mechanization of the World Picture'', IV 329–330, Oxford University Press, 1961. The author's final comment on this episode is:"The mechanization of the world picture led with irresistible coherence to the conception of God as a sort of 'retired engineer', and from here to God's complete elimination it took just one more step".</ref>

Scholars long debated whether Newton disputed the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. His first biographer, [[David Brewster]], who compiled his manuscripts, interpreted Newton as questioning the veracity of some passages used to support the Trinity, but never denying the doctrine of the Trinity as such.<ref>Brewster states that Newton was never known as an [[Arianism|Arian]] during his lifetime, it was [[William Whiston]], an Arian, who first argued that "Sir Isaac Newton was so hearty for the Baptists, as well as for the Eusebians or Arians, that he sometimes suspected these two were the two witnesses in the Revelations," while others like [[Hopton Haynes]] (a Mint employee and Humanitarian), "mentioned to [[Richard Baron (dissenting minister)|Richard Baron]], that Newton held the same doctrine as himself". David Brewster. ''Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton''. p. 268.</ref> In the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by Newton and bought by [[John Maynard Keynes]] (among others) were deciphered<ref name="The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes Volume X" /> and it became known that Newton did indeed reject Trinitarianism.<ref name="heretic" />

=== Religious thought ===

Newton and [[Robert Boyle]]'s approach to the [[mechanical philosophy]] was promoted by [[rationalist]] pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the [[pantheism|pantheists]] and [[enthusiasm|enthusiasts]], and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the [[latitudinarian]]s.<ref name="The Newtonians and the English Revolution: 1689–1720" /> The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] superlatives of both [[superstition|superstitious]] enthusiasm and the threat of [[atheism]],<ref name="Science and Religion in Seventeenth-Century England" /> and at the same time, the second wave of English [[deism|deists]] used Newton's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a "Natural Religion".

The attacks made against pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] "[[magical thinking]]", and the [[Christian mysticism|mystical elements of Christianity]], were given their foundation with Boyle's mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyle's ideas their completion through [[mathematical proof]]s and, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.<ref name="Enlightenment and Religion: Rational Dissent in eighteenth-century Britain" />

{{blockquote|Newton's fundamental contributions to science include the quantification of gravitational attraction, the discovery that white light is actually a mixture of immutable spectral colors, and the formulation of the calculus.

Newton's analysis of this book, which he made in Cambridge while protecting himself from London's 1665–1666 [[Great Plague of London|infection]], is the most substantial written statement he is known to have made about the plague, according to Bonhams. As far as the therapy is concerned, Newton writes that "the best is a toad suspended by the legs in a chimney for three days, which at last vomited up earth with various insects in it, on to a dish of yellow wax, and shortly after died. Combining powdered toad with the excretions and serum made into lozenges and worn about the affected area drove away the contagion and drew out the poison".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Flood |first=Alison |date=2 June 2020 |title=Isaac Newton proposed curing plague with toad vomit, unseen papers show |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/02/isaac-newton-plague-cure-toad-vomit |url-status=live |access-date=6 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606192933/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/02/isaac-newton-plague-cure-toad-vomit |archive-date=6 June 2020}}</ref>

Newton himself often told the story that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree.{{sfn|White|1997|p=86}}{{sfn|Numbers|2015|pp=48–56}} The story is believed to have passed into popular knowledge after being related by [[Catherine Barton]], Newton's niece, to [[Voltaire]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Malament |first=David&nbsp;B. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqcMQy-Ioc4C&q=catherine+barton+apple&pg=PA118 |title=Reading Natural Philosophy: Essays in the History and Philosophy of Science and Mathematics |date=2002 |publisher=Open Court Publishing |isbn=978-0-8126-9507-6 |access-date=18 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414055334/https://books.google.com/books?id=TqcMQy-Ioc4C&q=catherine+barton+apple&pg=PA118 |archive-date=14 April 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> Voltaire then wrote in his ''Essay on Epic Poetry'' (1727), "Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Voltaire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0o5bAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA104 |title=An Essay upon the Civil Wars of France, extracted from curious Manuscripts and also upon the Epick Poetry of the European Nations, from Homer down to Milton |date=1727 |publisher=Samuel Jallasson |location=London, England |page=104 |access-date=14 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210614182518/https://books.google.com/books?id=0o5bAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA104 |archive-date=14 June 2021 |url-status=live}} From p. 104: 'In the like Manner ''Pythagoras'' ow'd the Invention of Musik to the noise of the Hammer of a Blacksmith.

(One day in the year 1666 ''Newton'' withdrew to the country, and seeing the fruits of a tree fall, according to what his niece (Madame ''Conduit'') told me, he entered into a deep meditation on the cause that draws all bodies in a [straight] line, which, if it were extended, would pass very near to the center of the Earth.)</ref>

Although it has been said that the apple story is a myth and that he did not arrive at his theory of gravity at any single moment,<ref name="Berkun2010" /> acquaintances of Newton (such as [[William Stukeley]], whose manuscript account of 1752 has been made available by the Royal Society) do in fact confirm the incident, though not the apocryphal version that the apple actually hit Newton's head. Stukeley recorded in his ''Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's Life'' a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726:<ref name="Newton's apple: The real story" /><ref name="Hamblyn (2011)" /><ref name="NP">{{Cite web |title=Revised Memoir of Newton (Normalized Version) |url=http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00001 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314064817/http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00001 |archive-date=14 March 2017 |access-date=13 March 2017 |website=The Newton Project}}</ref>

{{Blockquote|we went into the garden, & drank thea under the shade of some appletrees, only he, & myself. amidst other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. "why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground," thought he to him self: occasion'd by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a comtemplative mood: "why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths centre? assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it. there must be a drawing power in matter. & the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the earths center, not in any side of the earth. therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly, or toward the center. if matter thus draws matter; it must be in proportion of its quantity. therefore the apple draws the earth, as well as the earth draws the apple."<!-- Please do not correct the spelling in this quotation, which is as per the cited source. -->}}

[[John Conduitt]], Newton's assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton's niece, also described the event when he wrote about Newton's life:<ref name="Keynes Ms. 130.4:Conduitt's account of Newton's life at Cambridge" />

{{Blockquote|In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself & if so, that must influence her motion & perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.}}
It is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however, it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory.<ref>I. Bernard Cohen and George E. Smith, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to Newton'' (2002) p. 6</ref> The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it "universal gravitation".

Various trees are claimed to be "the" apple tree which Newton describes. The [[King's School, Grantham]] claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster's garden some years later. The staff of the (now) [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]-owned [[Woolsthorpe Manor]] dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree<ref>Alberto A. Martinez ''Science Secrets: The Truth about Darwin's Finches, Einstein's Wife, and Other Myths'', p. 69 (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2011); {{isbn|978-0-8229-4407-2}}</ref> can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there.

=== Commemorations ===
[[File:Isaac Newton statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Newton statue on display at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]
Newton's monument (1731) can be seen in [[Westminster Abbey]], at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor [[Michael Rysbrack]] (1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect [[William Kent]].<ref>'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p13: London; Roger & Robert Nicholson; 1966</ref> The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A relief panel depicts [[putti]] using instruments such as a telescope and prism.<ref name="wmabbey" /> 

From 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D £1 [[banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]] issued by the [[Bank of England]] (the last £1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England). Newton was shown on the reverse of the notes holding a book and accompanied by a telescope, a prism and a map of the [[Solar System]].<ref name="bankofengland" />

A statue of Isaac Newton, looking at an apple at his feet, can be seen at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]. A large bronze statue, ''[[Newton, after William Blake]]'', by [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], dated 1995 and inspired by [[William Blake|Blake]]'s [[Newton (Blake)|etching]], dominates the piazza of the [[British Library]] in London. A bronze statue of Newton was erected in 1858 in the centre of [[Grantham]] where he went to school, prominently standing in front of [[Grantham Guildhall]].

The still-surviving farmhouse at Woolsthorpe By Colsterworth is a Grade I [[listed building]] by [[Historic England]] through being his birthplace and "where he discovered gravity and developed his theories regarding the refraction of light".<ref name="ReferenceA" />

== The Enlightenment ==
[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors—Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally—as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of [[nature]] and [[natural law]] to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.<ref>Cassels, Alan. Ideology and International Relations in the Modern World. p. 2.</ref>

It is held by European philosophers of the Enlightenment and by historians of the Enlightenment that Newton's publication of the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|''Principia'']] was a turning point in the [[Scientific Revolution]] and started the Enlightenment. It was Newton's conception of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that became one of the seeds for Enlightenment ideology.<ref>"Although it was just one of the many factors in the Enlightenment, the success of Newtonian physics in providing a mathematical description of an ordered world clearly played a big part in the flowering of this movement in the eighteenth century" by John Gribbin, ''Science: A History 1543–2001'' (2002), p. 241 {{ISBN|978-0-7139-9503-9}}</ref> Locke and [[Voltaire]] applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the [[physiocrat]]s and [[Adam Smith]] applied natural conceptions of [[psychology]] and self-interest to economic systems; and [[sociology|sociologists]] criticised the current [[social order]] for trying to fit history into natural models of [[progress (history)|progress]]. [[Monboddo]] and [[Samuel Clarke]] resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.
