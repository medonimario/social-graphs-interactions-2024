== Life ==
Valla was born in [[Rome]], with a family background of [[Piacenza]];<ref name="Treccani">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Marsico |first=Clementina |encyclopedia=[[Enciclopedia Treccani]] |title=VALLA, Lorenzo |url=https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lorenzo-valla_(Dizionario-Biografico) |language=it |year=2020 |location=[[Rome]] |publisher=Treccani |series=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani |volume=98 |access-date=30 July 2021}}</ref> his father, Luciave della Valla, was a [[lawyer]] who worked in the [[Papal Curia]]. He was educated in Rome, attending the classes of teachers including [[Leonardo Bruni]] and [[Giovanni Aurispa]], from whom he learned Latin and Greek.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He is thought otherwise to have been largely self-taught.<ref name="Cont">{{cite book |last1=Bietenholz |first1=Peter G. |last2=Deutscher |first2=Thomas Brian |title=Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation |date=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802085771 |page=372 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hruQ386SfFcC&pg=RA2-PA372 |language=en}}</ref>

Bruni was a papal secretary; Melchior Scrivani, Valla's uncle, was another. But Valla had caused offence, to Antonio Loschi, by championing the rhetorician [[Quintilian]] in an early work.<ref name="SEP">{{cite SEP |url-id=lorenzo-valla|title=Lorenzo Valla|first=Lodi|last=Nauta|date=May 22, 2017}}</ref> In 1431, he was ordained as a priest; the same year Valla tried in vain to secure a position as [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|apostolic secretary]]{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} to China.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gallery of Philologists {{!}} Lorenzo Valla |url=https://www.umass.edu/wsp/method/philology/gallery/valla.html |website=www.umass.edu}}</ref> He was unsuccessful, despite his network of contacts.<ref name="SEP"/>

Valla went to Piacenza, and then to [[Pavia]], where he obtained a professorship of eloquence. His tenure at Pavia was made uncomfortable by his attack on the Latin style of the jurist [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato]]. He became itinerant, moving from one university to another, accepting short engagements and lecturing in many cities.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Invited to Rome by [[Pope Nicholas V]] in 1447, Valla worked there on his ''Repastinatio''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nicholas of Cusa and Times of Transition: Essays in Honor of Gerald Christianson |date=2018 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004382411 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Wd9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA114 |language=en}}</ref> He became a papal scribe and, in 1455, a [[papal secretary]].<ref name="SEP"/>

Valla died in Rome. He was originally buried beneath the monumental bronze ''[[Lex de imperio Vespasiani]]'' behind the altar of [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran|Saint John Lateran]]. His tomb and epitaph were last seen by [[Seyfried Rybisch]] in 1570. In 1576, [[Pope Gregory XIII]], a staunch believer in the ''Donation of Constantine'', had them destroyed when he removed the bronze to the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]].<ref>{{citation |author=Jan L. de Jong |title=Review of Jean Hiernard (ed.), ''Les voyages de Seyfried Rybisch, étudiant silésien: Itinéraire (1548–1554)'' (Ausonius Éditions, 2017) |year=2019 |journal=Daphnis |volume=47 |pages=679–687 |doi=10.1163/18796583-04703003|s2cid=186971253 |url=https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/les-voyages-de-seyfried-rybisch-etudiant-silesien(a2536452-9dca-480c-b820-6b224ae4f8fd).html }}.</ref> Today, there is a memorial to Valla in the Lateran.<ref name="SEP"/>

==Reputation==
Older biographies of Valla give details of many literary and theological disputes, the most prominent one with [[Gianfrancesco Poggio Bracciolini]], which took place after his settlement in Rome. Extreme language was employed. He appears as quarrelsome, combining humanistic elegance with critical wit and venom, and an opponent of the temporal power of the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[Martin Luther|Luther]] had a high opinion of Valla and of his writings, and [[Robert Bellarmine]] called him "Luther's precursor". [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] stated in his ''De ratione studii'' that for Latin grammar, there was "no better guide than Lorenzo Valla".

==Works==
=== On the Donation of Constantine ===
Between 1439 and 1440, Valla wrote the essay, ''De falso credita et ementita Constantini Donatione declamatio'', which analyzed the document usually known as the ''[[Donation of Constantine]]''. The ''Donation'' suggests that [[Constantine I]] gave the whole of the [[Western Roman Empire]] to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. This was supposedly an act of gratitude for having been miraculously cured of [[leprosy]] by [[Pope Sylvester I]].

From 1435 to 1445, Valla was employed in the court of [[Alfonso V of Aragon]], who became involved in a territorial conflict with the [[Papal States]], then under [[Pope Eugene IV]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Valla |first1=Lorenzo |title=On the Donation of Constantine |date=2008 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674030893 |page=vii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gPhpKv1O65EC&pg=PR7 |language=en}}</ref> This relationship possibly motivated his work; in any case, he was put on trial before the [[Inquisition|Catholic Inquisition]] in 1444, but was protected from imprisonment by the intervention of Alfonso V.<ref name="Oxford"/>

Valla demonstrated that the internal evidence in the ''Donation'' told against a 4th-century origin: its vernacular style could be dated to the 8th century. Valla argued this thesis in three ways:

# By stating that the Emperor Constantine could not have legally given Pope Sylvester the powers that the ''Donation'' claimed.
# From the absence of contemporary evidence, Valla reasoned that it was implausible that a major change in the administration of the Western Roman Empire had taken place.
# Valla doubted that Emperor Constantine had given Pope Sylvester anything at all, suggesting a mistake involving an earlier Pope.

Supplementing these points, Valla argued from [[anachronism]]: the document contained the word ''[[satrap]]'', which he believed Romans such as Constantine I would not have used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CH310/CH310_T_33.html |title=Covenant Worldwide -- Ancient & Medieval Church History |accessdate=2008-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517201252/http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CH310/CH310_T_33.html |archivedate=2008-05-17 }}</ref> In addition, Valla believed that the quality of Latin for such a supposedly important text was undeniably poor, evidencing this by the fact that the text constantly switched tenses from "we have proclaimed" to "we decree", for instance.

===Textual criticism===
[[File:Historia de la Guerra del Peloponeso. Tucídides. (1450-1499) 01.jpg|thumb|Valla's Latin edition of Thucydides]]
A specialist in Latin translation, Valla made numerous suggestions for improving on [[Petrarch]]'s study of [[Livy]].<ref>See especially Giuseppe Billanovich, 'Petrarch and the Textual Tradition of Livy', in Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes XIV (1951), pp. 137-208.</ref> The emendation of Livy was also a topic discussed in book IV of his ''Antidotum in Facium'', an invective against [[Bartolomeo Facio]]. In this part of the treatise, which also circulated independently under the title ''Emendationes in T. Livium'', Valla elucidates numerous corrupt passages and criticises the attempts at emendation made by [[Panormita]] and Facio, his rivals at the court of Alfonso V.<ref>For a critical edition, see Lorenzo Valla, ''Antidotum in Facium'', ed. M. Regoliosi, Padua 1981, pp. 327-370.</ref>

In his critical study of the official Bible used by the Roman Catholic Church, [[Jerome]]'s [[Latin Vulgate]], Valla called into question the church's system of [[penance]] and [[indulgences]]. He argued that the practice of penance rested on Jerome's use of the Latin word ''[[wikt:paenitentia|paenitentia]]'' (penance) for the Greek ''metanoia'', which he believed would have been more accurately translated as "repentance". Valla's work was praised by later critics of the Church's penance and indulgence system, including [[Erasmus]].<ref>{{Cite journal| issn = 0891-9666| volume = 20| issue = Journal Article| pages = 35–| last = Prosser| first = Peter E.| title = Church history's biggest hoax: Renaissance scholarship proved fatal for one of the medieval papacy's favorite claims| journal = Christian History| date = 2001| url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GPS&sw=w&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA80303684&asid=2e95f78ae926bf1bb8b214ce55f2aabb}}{{subscription required|via=[[General OneFile]]}}</ref>

===Manuscript works===
Valla made a contemporary reputation with two works: his dialogue ''De Voluptate'' and his treatise ''De Elegantiis Latinae Linguae''. [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb]] said that his ''De Elegantiis'' "marked the highest level that had yet been reached in the critical study of Latin".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
