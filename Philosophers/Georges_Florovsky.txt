'''Georges Vasilievich Florovsky''' ({{langx|ru|Гео́ргий Васи́льевич Флоро́вский}}; {{OldStyleDate|9 September|1893|28 August}} – August 11, 1979) was a [[Russian Orthodox]] [[priest]], [[theologian]], and [[historian]].

Born in the [[Russian Empire]], he spent his working life in Paris (1920–1949) and New York (1949–1979). With [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Vladimir Lossky]], [[Justin Popović]] and [[Dumitru Stăniloae]] he was one of the more influential Eastern Orthodox Christian theologians of the mid-20th century. He was particularly concerned that modern Christian theology might receive inspiration from the lively intellectual debates of the [[patristic]] traditions of the undivided Church rather than from later [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] or [[Reformation]] categories of thought.

{{one source|section|date=February 2024}}
Georgiy Vasilievich Florovsky was born in [[Yelisavetgrad]] in the [[Kherson Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Kropyvnytskyi]], [[Ukraine]]) on 9 September 1893, the fourth child of an [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] [[priest]]. He grew up in [[Odesa]]. Raised in an erudite environment, he learned [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] while a schoolboy, and at eighteen he started to study [[philosophy]] and [[history]]. He graduated from the [[Odesa University|University of Odesa]] in 1916.

After his first graduation, he taught for three years at high schools in Odesa, and then made his full graduation including the [[licentia docendi]] at all universities in the Russian Empire.

In 1919, Florovsky began to teach at the University of Odessa, but, in 1920, his family was forced to leave Russia. Florovsky realized at that time that there would be no return for him, because [[Marxism]] did not accept the history and philosophy he taught. He was part of the [[emigration]] of Russian [[intelligentsia]], which also included [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Nicholas Lossky]] and his son [[Vladimir Lossky]], [[Alexander Schmemann]], and [[John Meyendorff]], the last two of whom would follow him in the [[United States]] as Dean of [[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary]] in New York.

In the 1920s, Florovsky had a personal and vocational friendship with the existentialist philosopher [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], but the two became distanced later, through Berdyaev's not understanding Florovsky's ordination to the presbyterate in 1932 and because of the critical attitude to Berdyaev's [[philosophy of religion]] expressed in Florovsky's ''Ways of Russian Theology'' (1937).

In 1924, Florovsky received his M.A. in [[Prague]]. In 1925, he became professor of [[patristics]] at the [[St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute|St. Serge Institute of Orthodox Theology]] in [[Paris]]. In this subject, he found his vocation. The lively debates of the thinkers of the early Church became for him a benchmark for Christian  [[theology]] and [[exegesis]], as well as a base for his critique of the ecumenical movement, and despite his not having earned an academic degree in theology (he was later awarded several honorary degrees), he would spend the rest of his life teaching at theological institutions. In 1932, Florovsky was [[ordination|ordained]] a [[priest]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. During the 1930s, he undertook extensive research in European libraries and published valuable patristic studies in Russian, such as his book on ''Eastern Fathers of the Fourth Century'' (1931) and ''The Byzantine Fathers Fifth to Eighth Centuries'' (1933). These were followed by his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''Ways of Russian Theology'' (1937). In this work, he questioned the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] influences of [[scholasticism]], [[pietism]], and [[idealism]] on Orthodox, and especially Russian, Christian theology and called for its reformulation in the light of patristic writings. The work was received with both enthusiasm and condemnation—there was no neutral attitude to it among Russian émigrés. One of his most prominent critics was [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]. Florovsky remained professor of patristics at the Institute until 1939, and from 1939 to 1948 taught there as professor of [[dogmatics]].

In 1949, Florovsky moved to the United States to take a position as Dean of [[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary]] in [[New York City]]. There, his development of the curriculum led to the Board of Regents of the [[University of the State of New York]] granting the Seminary an Absolute [[Charter]] in 1953.

In 1955, Florovsky was asked by his synod overseers to "lay down the deanship."<ref>Andrew Blane, ed., ''George Florovsky—Russian Intellectual and Orthodox Churchman'' (1993. St Vladimir’s Seminary Press, Crestwood NY), pp.&nbsp;109ff.</ref>{{why|date=February 2024}} He became a professor of divinity at [[Harvard University]] and ended his academic years as a professor at [[Princeton University]].

He died on 11 August 1979 in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].
