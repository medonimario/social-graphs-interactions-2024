A professor at the [[University of Virginia]] for a short time period, Ronell claims she was fired because she taught [[continental philosophy]] and "went to the gym on a regular basis: [her] colleagues were shocked by this—it didn't correspond to their image of an academic woman!"<ref>Avital Ronell, ''Fighting Theory: Avital Ronell in Conversation with Anne Dufourmantelle'', pg. 28–9, translated by Catherine Porter, [[University of Illinois Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-252-07623-7}}</ref> She joined the comparative literature faculty at the [[University of California, Riverside]] and then at [[University of California, Berkeley]] where she taught with [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] and [[Judith Butler]].<ref>Avital Ronell, "The Rhetoric of Testing" in ''Stupidity'' (University of Illinois Press, 2002), pp. 120</ref> She was a close friend of the writer [[Kathy Acker]] and identified with Acker's fiction, saying they were "destined to each other."<ref>Avital Ronell, ''Kathy Goes to Hell'', pg.14, [[University of Illinois Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-252-07623-7}}</ref> In 1996, she moved to [[NYU|New York University]], where she co-taught a course with Jacques Derrida until 2004.

==Overview of works==
Ronell argues for "the necessity of the unintelligible."<ref>{{YouTube|id=xVwoN2aLvL0&t=9m10s}}</ref> In an account of the 1992 [[Rodney King]] beating, Ronell argued that the idiom of the "perfectly clear" recurrently serves as a code for the [[white lie]].<ref>Avital Ronell, "TraumaTV," ''Finitude's Score: Essays for the End of the Millennium'', pg. 307, [[University of Illinois Press]], 1994, {{ISBN|0-8032-8949-9}}</ref> Instead of referring to herself as the [[authorship|author]] of a text, she has sometimes described herself as a "signatory," "operator," or even "television."<ref>{{YouTube|id=xVwoN2aLvL0?t=8m50s}}</ref> She sometimes focuses on thinkers who clean up after other thinkers, arguing that what she calls "sanitation departments" sometimes undermine the work they are tidying up after.<ref>Avital Ronell, "The Worst Neighborhoods of the Real: Philosophy - Telephone - Contamination," in ''Finitude's Score: Essays for the End of the Millennium'' ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1994), pp. 221, {{ISBN|0-8032-8949-9}}</ref>

===''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'' (1986)===
Ronell investigates one of Goethe's most influential works, ''[[Gespräche mit Goethe|Conversations with Eckermann]]'', which he did not write but instead dictated to a young companion, [[Johann Peter Eckermann|Johannes Peter Eckermann]]. Heralded by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] as "the best German book," ''Conversations with Eckermann'' contains Goethe's last thoughts about art, poetry, politics, religion, and the fate of [[German literature]] and [[German philosophy|philosophy]]. Ronell reads ''Conversations with Eckermann'' as a return from beyond the grave of the great master of German literature and science.

Ronell starts by exploring Goethe's focus on "a certain domain of immateriality—the nonsubstantializable apparitions&nbsp;... [of] weather forecasting&nbsp;... ghosts, dreams, and some forms of hidden, telepathic transmissions."<ref name="ReferenceA">Avital Ronell, "Introduction" in ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'', [[University of Illinois Press]], pg. xxii, {{ISBN|0-252-07349-5}}</ref> Ronell renames the Goethe-effect what she calls "killer texts"{{clarify|date=September 2018}} and describes the effect as the textual machination destructive of values, of the "worthier (''Werther'', from ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'')." The first part opens on Freud's debt to Goethe and reprints the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] of ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]].'' Ronell names Goethe the "secret councilor (''Geheimrat'')" of Freud and already anticipates her work on the [[Rat Man]] in the third footnote where she alludes to the "suppository logic, inserting the vital element into the narrative of the other."<ref>Avital Ronell, "Notes" in ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'', [[University of Illinois Press]], pg. 194, {{ISBN|0-252-07349-5}}</ref> In the first section Ronell aims to "attune [her] ears to the telepathic orders that Goethe's phantom transmitted to Freud by a remote control system.<ref>Avital Ronell, "Part One" in ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'', [[University of Illinois Press]], pg. 5, {{ISBN|0-252-07349-5}}</ref>

In general, ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'' traces the closure without end of influence's computation.{{clarify|date=September 2018}}<ref>[[Liliane Weissberg]], "Avital Ronell, 'Dictations: On Haunted Writing' (Book Review)," ''Germanic Review'', 64:3 (1989:Summper), pg.136</ref> Ronell's task entails a reading practice where the analysis of a text must investigate the endless movement towards closure in dictation. Ronell thus practices what is called anasemic reading, a practice developed by [[Nicolas Abraham]] and [[Maria Torok]], in which the psychoanalyst traces the textual metaphors, rhetorical structures, and linguistic associations of a writer/patient.

"Part Two" presents a case of literary parasitism between Eckermann and Goethe, and opens at the scene of Goethe's table in Weimar "the eleventh of September 1828, at two o'clock."<ref>Avital Ronell, "The Pas de Deus or ''Was'' is Goethe," in ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'' ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1986), pp. 71</ref> In other words, Ronell re-imagines the scene that Eckermann illustrates at the beginning and ending of ''Conversations with Eckermann''. Ronell starts to address the fiction of the writer as a particularly admirable human being and argues for the necessary passivity of the writer as a human being. Ronell also troubles the notion of a body of work as a totality.<ref>Avital Ronell, "The Pas de Deus or ''Was'' is Goethe," in ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'' ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1986), pp. 80</ref> Ronell remaps earlier arguments about feminine appropriation in terms of writing, for Eckermann, which "involves recuperating something 'for myself,' for the most part instinctively; it entails repetitive acts of appropriation."<ref>Avital Ronell, "The Pas de Deus or ''Was'' is Goethe," in ''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'' ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1986), pp. 81</ref>

''Dictations: On Haunted Writing'' explores how the work of writing in general adheres to a call dictated from elsewhere, a call formative of desire.

===''The Telephone Book: Technology — Schizophrenia — Electric Speech'' (1989)===
Ronell questions the operations that such ordinary objects as the [[telephone]] and [[book]] dictate. She signs the text as the operator of the [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] alongside [[Richard Eckersley (designer)|Richard Eckersley]], operator of [[design]], and Michael Jensen, operator of [[typesetting|compositor]]. Eckersley's design departs from his "[[typography|typographic]] subtlety and restraint" towards a [[computer]] design, marked by new page-making software programs to interpret the text typographically.<ref>Don Mills, "Deconstructed the conventions of graphic design: Obituary of Richard Eckersley," ''National Post'', 21 April 2006: PM.11, [Toronto Edition]</ref> Eckersley dislodges the text from presumed conventional settings and shifts the focus of reading with inexplicable gaps, displacements between sentences and paragraphs, mirror imaging of pages facing one another, words blurred to the point of indecipherability, and a regular exaggeration of negative line spacing, spilling sentences over into each other. Pushing the limits of an ordinary "Table of Contents" or "Footnotes," the operators set up a "[[Directory Assistance]]," in which chapters appear as reference indexes, and a yellow pages entitled "[[Classified advertising|Classified]]," in which footnotes appear as soliciting advertisements.

Following "A User's Manual," the text begins as if the reader answers a call: "And yet, you're saying yes, almost automatically, suddenly, sometimes irreversibly."<ref>Avital Ronell, "Delay Call Forwarding" in ''The Telephone Book: Technology, Schizophrenia, Electric Speech'' ([[University of Nebraska Press]], 1989), pp. 2, {{ISBN|0-8032-8938-3}}</ref> Ronell makes clear that ''The Telephone Book'' is a philosophical project on questions concerning the telephone, the call, and the answering machines: "always incomplete, always unreachable, forever promising at once its essence and its existence, philosophy identifies itself finally with this promise, which is to say, with its own unreachability."<ref>Avital Ronell, "Delay Call Forwarding" in ''The Telephone Book: Technology, Schizophrenia, Electric Speech'' ([[University of Nebraska Press]], 1989), pp. 3, {{ISBN|0-8032-8938-3}}</ref>

===''Crack Wars: Literature, Addiction, Mania'' (1992)===
Ronell takes as her point of departure Nietzsche's position that, as long as culture has existed, it has supported and inspired addiction.<ref>Avital Ronell, "Hits," in ''Crack Wars: Literature, Addiction, Mania'', ([[University of Nebraska Press]], 1992) pp. 3 {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8944-4}}</ref> She develops an argument investigating destructive desires that coincide with the [[war on drugs]] and with the very [[addiction]] to drugs which the war claims to want to vanquish. The text intends to disturb simple comprehension of [[drug]]s on one side or another of a [[binary opposition]].<ref>Avital Ronell, "Toward a Narcoanalysis," in ''Crack Wars: Literature, Addiction, Mania'', ([[University of Nebraska Press]], 1992) pp. 50 {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8944-4}}</ref>

===''Finitude's Score: Essays for the End of the Millennium'' (1994)===
Research assistant and friend, Shireen R.K. Patell, helped bring ''Finitude's Score'' to fruition.<ref name="Ronell Preface p xiv"/> ''Finitude's Score'' collects a series of reflections on the fragile memory left at the close of the millennium. It looks into the projects responsible for devastating humanity and a thinking of the future.<ref name="Ronell Preface p ix">Avital Ronell, "Preface," in ''Finitude's Score: Essays for the End of the Millennium'', ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1994) pp. ix, {{ISBN|0-8032-8949-9}}</ref> Ronell asks why the twentieth century stakes so much on a diction of deficiency. For Ronell, it says that, "we have been depleted."<ref name="Ronell Preface p ix"/> Ronell traces the relegitimization of war, the philosophical status of the rumor, the questionable force of the police, the test sites of technology, the corporeal policies of disease and a thoroughgoing reconstitution of the subject of law. In sum, ''Finitude's Score'' reads the desire to finish once and for all, to be done with issues definitively, as the everlasting legacy of the [[phallogocentrism|Western logos]].<ref name="Ronell Preface p xiv"/>

==Reception==
[[File:JBAR (213081280).jpg|thumb|Judith Butler and Ronell in 2006]]
Ronell's work has been both praised and criticized. In 1994, the journal ''[[Diacritics (journal)|Diacritics]]'' published a special edition "On the Work of Avital Ronell",<ref>{{Cite journal |date=Winter 1994 |title=Special Section: On the Work of Avital Ronell |journal=[[Diacritics (journal)|diacritics]] |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |jstor=i219995}}</ref> in which [[Jonathan Culler]] wrote: "Over the past decade, Ronell has put together what must be one of the most remarkable critical oeuvres of our era&nbsp;...

By contrast, in a 1990 review of ''The Telephone Book'' for the ''New York Times Book Review,'' novelist [[Robert Coover]] appreciated the "visual pyrotechnics" of the book's typography but found "the argument… to be that of a fairly conventional academic paper, recognizably party-lined with fashionable Continental voices like Jacques Lacan, Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida," and found the connection that Ronell tried to establish between Heidegger, schizophrenia, and the telephone "weak."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/03/books/reach-out-and-disturb-someone.html|title=Reach Out and Disturb Someone|last=Coover|first=Robert|date=June 3, 1990|work=New York Times Book Review|access-date=September 13, 2018}}</ref> In a 2002 review of ''Stupidity'' for the ''Times Literary Supplement,'' philosopher [[Jonathan Rée]] said Ronell's "prose reads like a plodding translation of a French version of Heidegger, but there is hardly a sentence that does not try to stop the show to receive an ovation for its cleverness."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/its-the-philosophy-stupid/|title=It's the philosophy, stupid|last=Ree|first=Jonathan|date=March 22, 2002|work=Times Literary Supplement|access-date=September 13, 2018}}</ref> [[Bernd Hüppauf]] (former chair of the German department at NYU who hired Ronell but was later replaced by her) similarly described her work as "translating incomprehensibility into pseudo-profundity."<ref name="Salon">{{cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/09/08/a-witch-hunt-or-a-quest-for-justice-an-insiders-perspective-on-disgraced-academic-avital-ronell/|title=A witch hunt or a quest for justice: An insider's perspective on disgraced academic Avital Ronell|last1=Hüppauf|first1=Bernd|date=8 September 2018|work=Salon|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>

In September 2017, a student, later identified as her male former graduate student Nimrod Reitman, filed a complaint in [[New York University]]'s [[Title IX]] office accusing Ronell of [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual assault]], [[stalking]], and retaliation over the span of three years, when she served as his doctoral supervisor.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/nyregion/sexual-harassment-nyu-female-professor.html|title=What Happens to #MeToo When a Feminist Is the Accused?|last=Greenberg|first=Zoe|url-access=subscription|date=August 13, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}</ref> In May 2018, the university found Ronell responsible for sexual harassment and suspended her for the 2018–19 academic year.

Providing historical and institutional context, an article in the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'' argued that Ronell's inappropriate conduct was intimately linked to the power that she wields within the humanities as a "theory star."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-apprentice-in-theory-fan-student-star/|title=The Apprentice in Theory: Fan, Student, Star|last1=Liu|first1=Catherine|last2=Bailey|first2=Devan|website=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=5 October 2018|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref>

Writer and critic [[Andrea Long Chu]] in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' described her experiences as a teaching assistant for Ronell at NYU, which made her believe Reitman's allegations. Noting that Ronell seemed to have felt 'persecuted' even while teaching, Andrea Long Chu argued that Ronell's desire for Reitman to make her 'feel loved' stemmed ''not'' from feeling 'entitle[d]' by 'status' to 'fuck'[''[[sic]]''] students, but, on the contrary, because "the relentless misogyny of the university" still seemed present to her:{{blockquote|[E]ven when she does have status and power and celebrity, she still [''[[sic]]''] thinks of herself as a vulnerable grad student in need of care and protection, ie, she thinks she still is the person Reitman is saying ''he'' is.

Ronell returned to teaching at NYU in the fall of 2019.
