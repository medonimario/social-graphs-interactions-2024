He died of a perforated [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]] on June 11, 1910, leaving Lucy to care for Linus, Lucile and Pauline.{{r|MeadHager|p=9}}

Pauling attributes his interest in becoming a chemist to being amazed by experiments conducted by a friend, [[Lloyd A. Jeffress]], who had a small chemistry lab kit.{{r|GoGo|p=17}} He later wrote: "I was simply entranced by chemical phenomena, by the reactions in which substances, often with strikingly different properties, appear; and I hoped to learn more and more about this aspect of the world."<ref name="Abrams">{{Cite book |last=Abrams |first=Irwin |url={{GBurl|id=ny77bPwKxaUC|page=198}} |title=The Nobel Peace Prize and the laureates : an illustrated biographical history, 1901–1987 |date=1988 |publisher=G.K.

In high school, Pauling conducted chemistry experiments by scavenging equipment and material from an abandoned steel plant. With an older friend, Lloyd Simon, Pauling set up Palmon Laboratories in Simon's basement.  They approached local dairies offering to perform butterfat samplings at cheap prices but dairymen were wary of trusting two boys with the task, and the business ended in failure.{{r|GoGo|p=21}}

At age 15, the high school senior had enough credits to enter [[Oregon State University]] (OSU), known then as Oregon Agricultural College.{{r|GoGo|p=22}} Lacking two American history courses required for his [[high school diploma]], Pauling asked the school principal if he could take the courses concurrently during the spring semester.

Pauling held a number of jobs to earn money for his future college expenses, including working part-time at a grocery store for {{currency|8|USD}} per week (equivalent to {{currency|{{inflation|US|8|1916|r=-1}}|USD}} in {{inflation/year|US}}).

This was soon raised to {{currency|50|USD}} per month.{{r|GoGo|p=23}} Pauling also set up a photography laboratory with two friends.{{r|GoGo|p=24}} In September 1917, Pauling was finally admitted by Oregon State University.

===Nature of the chemical bond===
[[File:Linus Pauling 1955a.jpg|thumb|Linus Pauling with an inset of his Nobel Prize in 1955]]

In the late 1920s, Pauling began publishing papers on the nature of the [[chemical bond]]. Between 1937 and 1938, he took a position as George Fischer Baker Non-Resident Lecturer in Chemistry at [[Cornell University]]. While at Cornell, he delivered a series of nineteen lectures<ref>{{Cite web |title=Outline of the George Fischer Baker Lectureship, Cornell University |url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/bond/notes/1937s.3-outline-01-large.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211112063624/http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/bond/notes/1937s.3-outline-01-large.html |archive-date=November 12, 2021 |access-date=April 13, 2022 |website=[[Oregon State University]] |language=en}}</ref> and completed the bulk of his famous textbook ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond''.<ref name="The George Fischer Baker Lectureship and the Beginnings of the Manuscript">{{Cite web |date=July 30, 2014 |title=The George Fischer Baker Lectureship and the Beginnings of the Manuscript |url=https://paulingblog.wordpress.com/2014/07/30/the-george-fischer-baker-lectureship-and-the-beginnings-of-the-manuscript/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220307085556/https://paulingblog.wordpress.com/2014/07/30/the-george-fischer-baker-lectureship-and-the-beginnings-of-the-manuscript/ |archive-date=March 7, 2022 |access-date=June 3, 2015 |website=The Pauling Blog |publisher=[[Oregon State University]] |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Pauling1960" />{{rp|Preface}} It is based primarily on his work in this area that he received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1954 "for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances".<ref name="Nobel" /> Pauling's book has been considered "chemistry's most influential book of this century and its effective bible".<ref name="Genes2001">{{Cite book |last=Watson |first=James D. |url=https://archive.org/details/passionfordnagen0000wats |title=A passion for DNA: genes, genomes, and society |date=2001 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-860428-0 |edition=2003 |location=[[Oxford]] |ol=7401431M |author-link=James Watson |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> In the 30 years after its first edition was published in 1939, the book was cited more than 16,000 times.

Part of Pauling's work on the nature of the chemical bond led to his introduction of the concept of [[orbital hybridization]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pauling |first=Linus |year=1928 |title=London's paper. General ideas on bonds |url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/bond/notes/sci3.001.21.html |access-date=June 2, 2015 |publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections}}</ref> While it is normal to think of the electrons in an atom as being described by [[atomic orbital|orbital]]s of types such as ''s'' and ''p'', it turns out that in describing the bonding in molecules, it is better to construct functions that partake of some of the properties of each. Thus the one 2s and three 2p orbitals in a carbon atom can be (mathematically) 'mixed' or combined to make four equivalent orbitals (called sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals), which would be the appropriate orbitals to describe carbon compounds such as [[methane]], or the 2s orbital may be combined with two of the 2p orbitals to make three equivalent orbitals (called sp{{sup|2}} hybrid orbitals), with the remaining 2p orbital unhybridized, which would be the appropriate orbitals to describe certain [[alkene|unsaturated]] carbon compounds such as [[ethylene]].{{r|Pauling1960|pages=111–120}} Other hybridization schemes are also found in other types of molecules.
Another area which he explored was the relationship between [[ionic bond]]ing, where electrons are transferred between atoms, and [[covalent bond]]ing, where electrons are shared between atoms on an equal basis. Pauling showed that these were merely extremes, and that for most actual cases of bonding, the [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] [[wave function]] for a polar molecule AB is a [[linear combination|combination]] of wave functions for covalent and ionic molecules.{{r|Pauling1960|page=66}} Here Pauling's ''[[electronegativity]]'' concept is particularly useful; the electronegativity difference between a pair of atoms will be the surest predictor of the degree of ionicity of the bond.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pauling |first=Linus |date=1930s |title=Notes and Calculations re: Electronegativity and the Electronegativity Scale |url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/bond/notes/sci5.001.14.html |access-date=February 29, 2008 |publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections}}</ref>

The third of the topics that Pauling attacked under the overall heading of "the nature of the chemical bond" was the accounting of the structure of [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, particularly the prototype, [[benzene]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pauling |first=Linus |date=January 6, 1934 |title=Benzene |url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/bond/notes/sci2.004.6.html |access-date=February 29, 2008 |publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections}}</ref> The best description of benzene had been made by the German chemist [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|Friedrich Kekulé]]. He had treated it as a rapid interconversion between two structures, each with alternating single and [[double bond]]s, but with the double bonds of one structure in the locations where the single bonds were in the other. Pauling showed that a proper description based on quantum mechanics was an intermediate structure which was a blend of each. The structure was a superposition of structures rather than a rapid interconversion between them. The name "[[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]]" was later applied to this phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pauling |first=Linus |date=July 29, 1946 |title=Resonance |url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/bond/notes/1946a.3.html |access-date=February 29, 2008 |publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections}}</ref> In a sense, this phenomenon resembles those of hybridization and also polar bonding, both described above, because all three phenomena involve combining more than one electronic structure to achieve an intermediate result.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

===Ionic crystal structures===
In 1929, Pauling published [[Pauling's rules|five rules]] which help to [[crystal structure prediction|predict]] and explain [[crystal structure]]s of [[ionic compound]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pauling, Linus |author-link=Pauling L |year=1929 |title=The principles determining the structure of complex ionic crystals |journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=1010–1026 |doi=10.1021/ja01379a006}}</ref><ref name=Pauling1960/> 
These rules concern (1) the ratio of cation radius to anion radius, (2) the electrostatic bond strength, (3) the sharing of polyhedron corners, edges and faces, (4) crystals containing different cations, and (5) the rule of parsimony.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

===Biological molecules===

In the mid-1930s, Pauling, strongly influenced by the biologically oriented funding priorities of the Rockefeller Foundation's [[Warren Weaver]], decided to strike out into new areas of interest.<ref name="Kay">{{Cite book |last=Kay |first=Lily E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEHeNI2a8OEC&pg=PA148 |title=The molecular vision of life: Caltech, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the rise of the new biology |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-511143-9 |location=New York [u.a.] |pages=148–151 |access-date=May 27, 2015}}</ref> Although Pauling's early interest had focused almost exclusively on inorganic molecular structures, he had occasionally thought about molecules of biological importance, in part because of Caltech's growing strength in biology. Pauling interacted with such great biologists as [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], [[Theodosius Dobzhanski]], [[Calvin Bridges]] and [[Alfred Sturtevant]].<ref name="Califano">{{Cite book |last=Califano |first=Salvatore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-sCt4RT0bMC&pg=PA198 |title=Pathways to modern chemical physics |date=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-28179-2 |location=Heidelberg [Germany] |page=198 |access-date=May 27, 2015}}</ref> His early work in this area included studies of the structure of [[hemoglobin]] with his student [[Charles D. Coryell]]. He demonstrated that the hemoglobin molecule changes structure when it gains or loses an [[oxygen]] molecule.<ref name=Califano/> As a result of this observation, he decided to conduct a more thorough study of [[protein structure]] in general. He returned to his earlier use of X-ray diffraction analysis. But protein structures were far less amenable to this technique than the crystalline minerals of his former work. The best X-ray pictures of proteins in the 1930s had been made by the British crystallographer [[William Astbury]], but when Pauling tried, in 1937, to account for Astbury's observations quantum mechanically, he could not.<ref name="Livio">{{Cite book |last=Livio |first=Mario |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0XmmAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA285 |title=Brilliant blunders: from Darwin to Einstein: colossal mistakes by great scientists that changed our understanding of life and the universe |date=2014 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-1-4391-9237-5 |location=[S.l.]}}</ref>

It took eleven years for Pauling to explain the problem: his [[mathematics|mathematical]] analysis was correct, but Astbury's pictures were taken in such a way that the protein molecules were tilted from their expected positions. Pauling had formulated a model for the structure of hemoglobin in which atoms were arranged in a [[helix|helical]] pattern, and applied this idea to proteins in general.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

In 1951, based on the structures of [[amino acid]]s and [[peptide]]s and the planar nature of the [[peptide bond]], Pauling, [[Robert Corey]] and [[Herman Branson]] correctly proposed the [[alpha helix]] and [[beta sheet]] as the primary [[structural motif]]s in protein [[secondary structure]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Pauling |first1=L |last2=Corey |first2=RB |year=1951 |title=Configurations of Polypeptide Chains With Favored Orientations Around Single Bonds: Two New Pleated Sheets |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=729–40 |bibcode=1951PNAS...37..729P |doi=10.1073/pnas.37.11.729 |pmc=1063460 |pmid=16578412 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="Goertzel and Goertzel, p. 95-100">Goertzel and Goertzel, p. 95-100.</ref> This work exemplified Pauling's ability to think unconventionally; central to the structure was the unorthodox assumption that one turn of the helix may well contain a non-[[integer]] number of amino acid residues; for the alpha helix it is 3.7 amino acid residues per turn.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

Pauling then proposed that [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) was a [[triple helix]];<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Pauling |first1=L |last2=Corey |first2=RB |date=February 1953 |title=A Proposed Structure For The Nucleic Acids |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=84–97 |bibcode=1953PNAS...39...84P |doi=10.1073/pnas.39.2.84 |pmc=1063734 |pmid=16578429 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Linus Pauling's DNA Model |url=http://www.farooqhussain.org/projects/paulingdnamodel |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204210701/http://www.farooqhussain.org/projects/paulingdnamodel |archive-date=February 4, 2012 |access-date=June 2, 2015}}</ref> his model contained several basic mistakes, including a proposal of neutral phosphate groups, an idea that conflicted with the acidity of DNA. [[William Lawrence Bragg|Sir Lawrence Bragg]] had been disappointed that Pauling had won the race to find the alpha [[Alpha helix|helix structure]] of proteins. Bragg's team had made a fundamental error in making their models of protein by not recognizing the planar nature of the peptide bond. When it was learned at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] that Pauling was working on molecular models of the structure of DNA, [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] were allowed to make a molecular model of DNA. They later benefited from unpublished data from [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]] at [[King's College London|King's College]] which showed evidence for a helix and planar base stacking along the helix axis. Early in 1953 Watson and Crick proposed a correct structure for the DNA double helix. Pauling later cited several reasons to explain how he had been misled about the structure of DNA, among them misleading density data and the lack of high quality X-ray diffraction photographs. Pauling described this situation as "the biggest disappointment in his life".<ref name="Dye-LATimes">{{Cite web |last=Dye |first=Lee |date=June 2, 1985 |title=The Deeply Personal War of Linus Pauling: Nobel Prize-Winning Chemist Still Battles for His Controversial Vitamin Theory |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-06-02-vw-15174-story.html |access-date=April 9, 2023 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |language=en-US}}</ref>

During the time Pauling was researching the problem, Rosalind Franklin in England was creating the world's best images. They were key to Watson's and Crick's success. Pauling did not see them before devising his mistaken DNA structure, although his assistant Robert Corey did see at least some of them, while taking Pauling's place at a summer 1952 protein conference in England. Pauling had been prevented from attending because his passport was withheld by the State Department on suspicion that he had Communist sympathies. This led to the legend that Pauling missed the structure of DNA because of the politics of the day (this was at the start of the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] period in the United States). Politics did not play a critical role. Not only did Corey see the images at the time, but Pauling himself regained his passport within a few weeks and toured English laboratories well before writing his DNA paper. He had ample opportunity to visit Franklin's lab and see her work, but chose not to.<ref name="Nature" />{{rp|414–415}} Despite these times, Pauling chose to move on from them and be thankful for the discoveries that he had already found.<ref name="Dye-LATimes"/>

Pauling also studied [[enzyme]] reactions and was among the first to point out that enzymes bring about reactions by stabilizing the [[transition state]] of the reaction, a view which is central to understanding their mechanism of action.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Metzler |first=David E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X194AYXInC8C&pg=PA330 |title=Biochemistry |date=2003 |publisher=Harcourt, Academic Pr. |isbn=978-0-12-492541-0 |edition=2nd |location=San Diego |ref=Metzler}}</ref> He was also among the first scientists to postulate that the binding of [[antibodies]] to antigens would be due to a complementarity between their structures.<ref name="Lewis">{{Cite book |first1=Julius M. |last1=Cruse |first2=Robert E. |last2=Lewis  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNI5Lk2z37sC&pg=PA21 |title=Atlas of immunology |date=2010 |publisher=CRC Press/Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-1-4398-0268-7 |edition=3rd |location=Boca Raton, FL |page=21 |access-date=May 27, 2015}}</ref> Along the same lines, with the physicist turned biologist [[Max Delbrück]], he wrote an early paper arguing that [[DNA replication]] was likely to be due to [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementarity]], rather than similarity, as suggested by a few researchers.

His success with sickle cell anemia led Pauling to speculate that a number of other diseases, including mental illnesses such as [[schizophrenia]], might result from flawed genetics. As chairman of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering and director of the Gates and Crellin Chemical Laboratories, he encouraged the hiring of researchers with a chemical-biomedical approach to mental illness, a direction not always popular with established [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] chemists.<ref name="LATimes1994">{{Cite news |date=August 21, 1994 |title=A Flamboyant Scientist's Legacy : Scholar: Linus C.

The basic idea behind Pauling's spheron model is that a nucleus can be viewed as a set of "clusters of nucleons". The basic nucleon clusters include the [[deuteron]] [np], [[helion (chemistry)|helion]] [pnp], and [[tritium|triton]] [npn]. [[Even-even nucleus|Even–even nuclei]] are described as being composed of clusters of [[alpha particle]]s, as has often been done for light nuclei.<ref name="Clusters">{{Cite journal |last=Pauling |first=Linus |date=November 15, 1969 |title=Orbiting clusters in atomic nuclei |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=807–809 |bibcode=1969PNAS...64..807P |doi=10.1073/pnas.64.3.807 |pmc=223305 |pmid=16591799 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Pauling attempted to derive the shell structure of nuclei from pure geometrical considerations related to [[Platonic solids]] rather than starting from an independent particle model as in the usual [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]].

Public pressure and the frightening results of the CNI research led to a moratorium on above-ground nuclear weapons testing, followed by the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], signed in 1963 by [[John F.

===Political criticism===
[[File:Linus Pauling's beret at the Nobel Museum (51969).jpg|thumb|Pauling's beret on display at the [[Nobel Prize Museum]]]]
Many of Pauling's critics, including scientists who appreciated the contributions that he had made in chemistry, disagreed with his political positions and saw him as a naïve spokesman for [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet communism]]. In 1960, he was ordered to appear before the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]],<ref name="Senate">{{Cite web |title=issued to Linus Pauling by the Internal Security Subcommittee of the United States Senate.

Pauling was a frequent target of the ''[[National Review]]'' magazine. In an article entitled "The Collaborators" in the magazine's July 17, 1962, issue, Pauling was referred to not only as a collaborator, but as a "fellow traveler" of proponents of Soviet-style communism.  In 1963, Pauling sued the magazine, its publisher [[William Rusher]], and its editor [[William F. Buckley, Jr]] for $1 million. He lost both his libel suits and the 1968 appeal (unlike his earlier 1963 libel case against the [[Hearst Corporation]]), because in the meantime the landmark case ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'' had established the [[actual malice]] standard for libel lawsuits by public figures, requiring that not only falsehood but deliberate lying should be proved by the plaintiff in such cases.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 30, 2013 |title=The National Review Lawsuit |url=http://paulingblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/the-national-review-lawsuit/ |access-date=December 20, 2013 |publisher=Paulingblog}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=A Tough Conclusion to the National Review Lawsuit |url=http://paulingblog.wordpress.com/tag/william-f-buckley/ |access-date=December 20, 2013 |publisher=Paulingblog}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Pauling v.

His peace activism, his frequent travels, and his enthusiastic expansion into chemical-biomedical research all aroused opposition at Caltech. In 1958, the Caltech Board of Trustees demanded that Pauling step down as chairman of the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Division.<ref name=LATimes1994/>{{rp|2}}  Although he had retained tenure as a full professor, Pauling chose to resign from Caltech after he received the Nobel peace prize money. He spent the next three years at the [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]] (1963–1967).<ref name="Abrams" /> In 1967, he moved to the University of California at San Diego, but remained there only briefly, leaving in 1969 in part because of political tensions with the Reagan-era board of regents.<ref name=LATimes1994/>{{rp|3}}  From 1969 to 1974, he accepted a position as professor of chemistry at Stanford University.<ref name="OH" />

===Vietnam war activism===
During the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson's policy of increasing America's involvement in the Vietnam War caused an [[anti-war movement]] that the Paulings joined with enthusiasm. Pauling denounced the war as unnecessary and unconstitutional. He made speeches, signed protest letters and communicated personally with the North Vietnamese leader, Ho Chi Minh, and gave the lengthy written response to President Johnson. His efforts were ignored by the American government.<ref>{{Cite web |year=2010 |title=Linus Pauling and the International Peace Movement: Vietnam |url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/peace/narrative/page49.html |publisher=Oregon State University Libraries}}</ref>

===Eugenics===
Pauling supported a limited form of [[eugenics]] by suggesting that human carriers of defective genes be given a compulsory visible mark – such as a forehead tattoo – to discourage potential mates with the same defect, in order to reduce the number of babies with diseases such as [[sickle cell anemia]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mendelsohn |first=Everett |author-link=Everett Mendelsohn |date=March–April 2000 |title=The Eugenic Temptation |url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/the-eugenic-temptation.html |website=Harvard Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Special Collections & Archives Research Center, Oregon State University Libraries |date=2015 |title=Eugenics for Alleviating Human Suffering |url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/blood/narrative/page35.html |access-date=May 30, 2020 |website=It's in the Blood!

===Medical research and vitamin C advocacy===
{{main|Vitamin C megadosage}}
[[File:Pauling Vit C Book Cover.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Pauling's book, ''How to Live Longer and Feel Better'', advocated very high intake of [[Vitamin C]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pauling |first=Linus |title=How to Live Longer and Feel Better |publisher=Avon Books |year=1987 |edition=1 |location=New York |ol=18076125M}}</ref>]]

In 1941, at age 40, Pauling was diagnosed with [[Bright's disease]], a renal disease. Following the recommendations of [[Thomas Addis]], who actively recruited Ava Helen Pauling as "nutritionist, cook, and eventually as deputy 'doctor'", Pauling believed he was able to control the disease with Addis's then-unusual low-protein salt-free diet and vitamin supplements.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Peitzman |first=Steven J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FUDO5K1pAoC&pg=PA72 |title=Dropsy, dialysis, transplant: a short history of failing kidneys |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8018-8734-5 |location=Baltimore |pages=72–8; 190}}</ref> Thus Pauling's initial – and intensely personal – exposure to the idea of treating disease with vitamin supplements was positive.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

In 1965, Pauling read ''Niacin Therapy in Psychiatry'' by [[Abram Hoffer]] and theorized vitamins might have important biochemical effects unrelated to their prevention of associated deficiency diseases.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Biochemical imbalances in disease a practitioner's handbook |publisher=Singing Dragon |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-85701-028-5 |editor-last=Nicolle |editor-first=Lorraine |location=London |page=27 |editor-last2=Beirne |editor-first2=Ann Woodriff}}</ref> In 1968, Pauling published a brief paper in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] entitled "Orthomolecular psychiatry",<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pauling |first=Linus |date=April 1968 |title=Orthomolecular psychiatry.

Pauling coined the term "orthomolecular" to refer to the practice of varying the concentration of substances normally present in the body to prevent and treat disease. His ideas formed the basis of [[orthomolecular medicine]], which is not generally practiced by conventional medical professionals and has been strongly criticized.<ref name="Cassileth">{{Cite book |last=Cassileth |first=Barrie R. |author-link=Barrie R.

In 1973, with [[Arthur B. Robinson]] and another colleague, Pauling founded the Institute of Orthomolecular Medicine in Menlo Park, California, which was soon renamed the [[Linus Pauling Institute]] of Science and Medicine. Pauling directed research on vitamin C, but also continued his theoretical work in chemistry and physics until his death. In his last years, he became especially interested in the possible role of vitamin C in preventing [[atherosclerosis]] and published three case reports on the use of [[lysine]] and vitamin C to relieve [[angina pectoris]]. During the 1990s, Pauling put forward a comprehensive plan for the treatment of heart disease using lysine and vitamin C. In 1996, a website was created expounding Pauling's treatment which it referred to as Pauling Therapy. Proponents of Pauling Therapy believe that  heart disease can be treated and even cured using only lysine and Vitamin C and without drugs or heart operations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=PaulingTherapy.com – Reversing Heart Disease w/o Drugs is Possible |url=http://www.paulingtherapy.com/ |website=www.paulingtherapy.com}}</ref>

Pauling's work on [[vitamin C]] in his later years generated much controversy. He was first introduced to the concept of high-dose vitamin C by biochemist [[Irwin Stone]] in 1966. After becoming convinced of its worth, Pauling took 3&nbsp;grams of vitamin C every day to prevent [[colds]].<ref name="frs" /> Excited by his own perceived results, he researched the clinical literature and published ''[[Vitamin C and the Common Cold (book)|Vitamin C and the Common Cold]]'' in 1970. He began a long clinical collaboration with the British cancer surgeon [[Ewan Cameron (physician)|Ewan Cameron]] in 1971 on the use of intravenous and oral vitamin C as cancer therapy for terminal patients.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cameron |first=Ewan |author-link=Ewan Cameron |title=Cancer Bibliography: Ewan Cameron, M.D. and Vitamin C Therapy |url=http://www.doctoryourself.com/biblio_cameron.html |access-date=August 5, 2007 |publisher=Doctoryourself.com}}</ref> Cameron and Pauling wrote many technical papers and a popular book, ''Cancer and Vitamin C'', that discussed their observations. Pauling made vitamin C popular with the public<ref name="OnThisDay">{{Cite news |last=Severo |first=Richard |date=August 21, 1994 |title=Linus C.

A re-evaluation of the claims in 1982 found that the patient groups were not actually comparable, with the vitamin C group being less sick on entry to the study, and judged to be "terminal" much earlier than the comparison group.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=DeWys |first=WD |year=1982 |title=How to evaluate a new treatment for cancer |journal=Your Patient and Cancer |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=31–36}}</ref> Later clinical trials conducted by the [[Mayo Clinic]] led by oncologist [[Edward T.
