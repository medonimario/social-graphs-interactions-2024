'''John Nicholas Gray''' (born 17 April 1948) is an English [[political philosopher]] and author with interests in [[analytic philosophy]], the [[history of ideas]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/john-gray-at-the-writers-festival---part-1/3274788 |title=John Gray at the Writers' Festival – Part 1 – The Philosopher's Zone – ABC Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=28 June 2008 |access-date=9 August 2013}}</ref> and [[philosophical pessimism]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=De Botton |first=Alain |date=2013-03-04 |title=Alain de Botton on five great philosophical pessimists |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/authorinterviews/9902122/Alain-de-Botton-on-five-great-philosophical-pessimists.html |access-date=2022-12-01 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref> He retired in 2008 as School Professor of European Thought at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]]. Gray contributes regularly to ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' and the ''[[New Statesman]]'', where he is the lead book reviewer. He is an [[atheist]].<ref name="Atheism">{{cite news |last1=Preston |first1=John |date=28 February 2013 |title=John Gray interview: how an English academic become the world's pre-eminent prophet of doom |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9888780/John-Gray-interview-how-an-English-academic-become-the-worlds-pre-eminent-prophet-of-doom.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>

Gray has written several influential books, including ''[[False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism]]'' (1998), which argues that free market globalisation is an unstable [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] project currently in the process of disintegration; ''[[Straw Dogs (book)|Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals]]'' (2002), which attacks philosophical [[humanism]], a worldview which Gray sees as originating in religions; and ''[[Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia]]'' (2007), a critique of [[utopian]] thinking in the modern world.

Gray sees [[volition (psychology)|volition]], and hence [[morality]], as an illusion, and portrays humanity as a ravenous species engaged in wiping out other forms of life. Gray has written that "humans ... cannot destroy the Earth, but they can easily wreck the environment that sustains them."<ref>John Gray, ''Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals'', (Granta Books 2002), p. 12. {{ISBN|1-86207-512-3}}</ref>

==Academic career==
Gray was born into a working-class family, with a docker-turned-carpenter father,<ref name="Atheism" /> in [[South Shields]], County Durham. He attended [[Harton Academy|South Shields Grammar-Technical School for Boys]] from 1959 until 1967,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/philosophy/2009/04/john-gray-enlightenment-world |title=The NS Profile: John Gray |date=16 April 2009 |publisher=Newstatesman.com |access-date=9 August 2013}}</ref> then studied at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], reading [[philosophy, politics and economics]] (PPE), completing his B.A., M.Phil. and D.Phil.

He formerly held posts as lecturer in political theory at the [[University of Essex]], fellow and tutor in politics at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], and lecturer and then professor of politics at the [[University of Oxford]]. He has served as a visiting professor at [[Harvard University]] (1985–86) and Stranahan Fellow at the Social Philosophy and Policy Center, [[Bowling Green State University]] (1990–1994), and has also held visiting professorships at [[Tulane University]]'s Murphy Institute (1991) and [[Yale University]] (1994). He was Professor of European Thought at the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]] until his retirement from academic life in early 2008.

==Political and philosophical thought==
{{Conservatism UK|Intellectuals}}
Among philosophers, he is known for a thoroughgoing rejection of [[John Rawls|Rawlsianism]]{{explain|date=September 2019}} and for exploration of the uneasy relationship between [[value pluralism]] and liberalism in the work of [[Isaiah Berlin]].<ref>{{Cite book

}} §4. Ethical Thought and Value Pluralism.</ref>

Gray's political thought is noted for its mobility across the political spectrum over the years. As a student, Gray was on the left and continued to vote [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] into the mid-1970s. By 1976 he had shifted towards a right-liberal [[New Right]] position, on the basis that the world was changing irrevocably through technological inventions, realigned financial markets and new economic power blocs and that the left failed to comprehend the magnitude and nature of this change.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Colls |first1=Robert |date=10 January 2003 |title=Ethics Man: John Gray's New Moral World |journal=[[The Political Quarterly]] |volume=69 |pages=59–71 |doi=10.1111/1467-923X.00137}}</ref> In the 1990s Gray became an advocate for [[environmentalism]] and [[New Labour]]. Gray considers the conventional (left-wing/right-wing) political spectrum of conservatism and [[social democracy]] as no longer viable.<ref>''False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism''</ref>

On [[liberalism]], Gray identified the common strands in liberal thought as being ''individualist'', ''egalitarian'', ''[[Meliorism|meliorist]]'', and ''universalist''. The individualist element avers the ethical primacy of the human being against the pressures of social [[Collectivism and individualism|collectivism]], the egalitarian element assigns the same moral worth and status to all individuals, the meliorist element asserts that successive generations can improve their sociopolitical arrangements, and the universalist element affirms the moral unity of the human species and marginalises local cultural differences.<ref name="Gray, p. xii">Gray, John. ''Liberalism''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-8166-2801-7}}, p. xii.</ref>

More recently, he has criticised [[neoliberalism]], the global [[free market]] and some of the central currents in [[Western philosophy|Western thinking]], such as [[humanism]], while moving towards aspects of [[environmentalism|green thought]], drawing on the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia theory]] of [[James Lovelock]]. It is perhaps for this critique of humanism that Gray is best known.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals''</ref>

Central to the doctrine of humanism, in Gray's view, is the inherently [[utopian]] belief in [[meliorism]]; that is, that humans are not limited by their biological natures and that advances in ethics and politics are cumulative and that they can alter or improve the [[human condition]], in the same way that advances in science and technology have altered or improved [[living standards]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Gray contends, in opposition to this view, that history is not progressive, but cyclical. [[Human nature]], he argues, is an inherent obstacle to cumulative ethical or political progress.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Seeming improvements, if there are any, can very easily be reversed: one example he has cited has been the use of [[torture]] by the United States against terrorist suspects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/939/going-nowhere-laurie-taylor-interviews-john-gray |title=Going nowhere: Laurie Taylor interviews John Gray |publisher=Newhumanist.org.uk |date=31 May 2007 |access-date=9 August 2013}}</ref> "What's interesting", Gray said in an interview in ''[[032c]]'' magazine, "is that torture not only came back, but was embraced by liberals, and defended by liberals. Now there are a lot of people, both liberal and conservative, who say, 'Well, it's a very complicated issue.' But it wasn't complicated until recently. They didn't say that five or ten years ago."<ref>{{cite web |last=Obrist |first=Hans Ulrich |date=2008 |title=John Gray: Post-American Age |url=http://032c.com/2008/post-american-age/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629012506/http://www.032c.com/2008/post-american-age/ |archive-date=29 June 2010 |access-date=11 February 2013 |website=[[032c]] |publisher=}}</ref>

Furthermore, he argues that this belief in progress, commonly imagined to be secular and liberal, is in fact derived from an erroneous Christian notion of humans as morally autonomous beings categorically different from other animals. This belief, and the corresponding idea that history makes sense, or is progressing towards something, is in Gray's view merely a Christian prejudice.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In ''[[Straw Dogs (book)|Straw Dogs]]'' he argues that the idea that humans are [[self-determination|self-determining]] agents does not pass the acid test of experience. Those [[Darwinist]] thinkers who believe humans can take charge of their own destiny to prevent environmental degradation are, in this view, not [[naturalists]], but apostles of humanism.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

He identifies the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as the point at which the [[salvation|Christian doctrine of salvation]] was taken over by secular idealism and became a political religion with universal emancipation as its aim.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Communism, fascism and "global democratic capitalism" are characterised by Gray as Enlightenment "projects" which have led to needless suffering, in Gray's view, as a result of their ideological allegiance to this religion.<ref>The darkness within.

===Agonistic liberalism<!--'Agonistic liberalism' redirects here-->===
The term '''[[Agonism|agonistic]] liberalism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> appears in Gray's 1995 book ''Isaiah Berlin''. Gray uses this phrase to describe what he believes is Berlin's theory of politics, namely his support for both value pluralism and liberalism.

More generally, agonistic liberalism could be used to describe any kind of liberalism that claims its own value commitments do not form a complete vision of politics and society, and that one instead needs to look for what Berlin calls an "uneasy equilibrium" between competing values. In Gray's view, many contemporary liberal theorists would fall into this category, for instance [[John Rawls]] and [[Karl Popper]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[Friedrich Hayek]] described Gray's 1984 book ''Hayek on Liberty'' as "The first survey of my work which not only fully understands but is able to carry on my ideas beyond the point at which I left off."<ref name="Robin2011">{{cite book |author=Robin |first=Corey |url= |title=[[The Reactionary Mind]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-991188-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780199793747/page/91 91] |doi=10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199793747.001.0001}}</ref>

Gray has discussed James Lovelock's new ideas on evolution's next step: a species beyond humanity that will be better able to co-exist with other species on this planet in the distant future.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

His 1998 book ''[[False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism|False Dawn]]'' was praised by George Soros as "a powerful analysis of the deepening instability of global capitalism" which "should be read by all who are concerned about the future of the global economy".<ref name="ReferenceB"/> John Banville praised ''[[Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia|Black Mass]]'', saying that "Gray's assault on Enlightenment ideas of progress is timelier than ever".<ref>Gray's Anatomy: Selected Writings</ref>

His 2002 book [[Straw Dogs (book)|''Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals'']] has received particular praise. J. G. Ballard wrote that the book "challenges most of our assumptions about what it means to be human, and convincingly shows that most of them are delusions" and described it "a powerful and brilliant book", "an essential guide to the new millennium" and "the most exhilarating book I have read since [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''."<ref name="strawdogs">{{cite book|title=Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals |isbn=978-1-86207-596-2 |last1=Gray |first1=John |date=29 April 2024 |publisher=Granta Books }}</ref> Will Self called the book "a contemporary work of philosophy devoid of jargon, wholly accessible, and profoundly relevant to the rapidly evolving world we live in" and wrote "I read it once, I read it twice and took notes. I arranged to meet its author so I could publicise the book – I thought it that good."<ref name="independent" /><ref name="strawdogs" />

In 2002 ''Straw Dogs'' was named a book of the year by J. G. Ballard in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''; by [[George Walden]] in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]''; by Will Self, [[Joan Bakewell]], [[Jason Cowley (journalist)|Jason Cowley]] and [[David Marquand]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]''; by [[Andrew Marr]] in ''[[The Observer]]''; by [[Jim Crace]] in ''[[The Times]]''; by Hugh Lawson Tancred in ''[[The Spectator]]''; by [[Richard Holloway]] in the ''[[Glasgow Herald]]''; and by [[Sue Cook]] in ''[[The Sunday Express]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] has written that John Gray is the modern thinker for whom he has the most respect, calling him "prophetic".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantabooks.com/page/3012/False+Dawn/1302 |title=Granta Books |publisher=Granta Books |access-date=9 August 2013}}</ref>

=== Criticism ===
Gray's ''[[Straw Dogs (book)|Straw Dogs]]'' has been criticised by [[Terry Eagleton]], who has written: "mixing [[nihilism]] and [[New Age]]ism in equal measure, Gray scoffs at the notion of [[progress (history)|progress]] for 150 pages before conceding that there is something to be said for [[anaesthetics]]. The enemy in his sights is not so much a straw dog as a [[straw man]]: the kind of starry-eyed [[rationalist]] who passed away with [[John Stuart Mill]], but who he has to pretend still rules the world".<ref>{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Eagleton |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/07/highereducation.news2 |title=Review: Straw Dogs by John Gray |work=The Guardian |date=7 September 2002 |access-date=9 August 2013 |location=London}}</ref>

The academic and author Danny Postel of the [[University of Denver]] also took issue with ''Straw Dogs''. Postel stated that Gray's claim that environmental destruction was the result of humanity's flawed nature would be "welcome news to the captains of industry and the architects of the global economy; the ecological devastation they leave in their wake, according to Gray, has nothing to do with their exploits."<ref name="dp">{{cite journal |first=Danny |last=Postel |url= http://www.thenation.com/article/grays-anatomy?page=0,0 |title=Gray's Anatomy |journal=The Nation |location=New York |date=22 December 2003 |access-date= 25 April 2013}}</ref> Postel also claimed that too much of ''Straw Dogs'' rested on "blanket assertion", and criticised Gray's use of the term "plague of people" as an outdated "[[neo-Malthusian]] persiflage about [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]".<ref name="dp" /> Postel strongly condemned Gray for outlining "complete political passivity. There is no point whatsoever in our attempting to make the world a less cruel or more livable place."<ref name="dp" />

In his 2004 book, ''How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World'', the British journalist, writer and broadcaster, [[Francis Wheen]], wrote:{{blockquote|"Conservatives, Marxists, post-modernists and pre-modernists have queued up to take a kick at the bruised ideas of the eighteenth century. The most vicious of these boot-boys is John Gray, professor of European thought at the London School of Economics, who has published dozens of increasingly apocalyptic books and articles on the need to end the Enlightenment project forthwith. Whereas [[Alasdair MacIntyre|MacIntyre]] seeks sanctuary in twelfth-century monasteries, for Gray our only hope of salvation is to embrace Eastern mysticism ... Taoism seems to be his favoured creed but it is hard to interpret Gray's prescriptions with any certainty, partly because of his scattergun style but mostly because he changes his mind so often. A line on the dust-jacket of ''Enlightenment's Wake'' (1995), which says that the book 'stakes out the elements of John Gray's new position' could just as well be appended to everything he writes."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wheen |first=Francis |title=How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World |publisher=HarperCollinsFourth Estate |year=2004 |isbn=0-00-714097-5 |location=London |pages=187}}</ref> }}
