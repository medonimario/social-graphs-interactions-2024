{{Wittgenstein|People}}
'''Peter Guy Winch''' (14 January 1926 &ndash; 27 April 1997) was a British [[philosophy|philosopher]] known for his contributions to the [[philosophy of social science]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein scholarship]], [[ethics]], and the [[philosophy of religion]]. His early book ''The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy'' (1958) was an attack on [[positivism]] in the [[social sciences]], drawing on the work of [[R. G. Collingwood]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy.

==Biography==
Winch was born on 14 January 1926, in [[Walthamstow]], [[London]]. He attended [[Leyton Sixth Form College|Leyton County High School for boys]],<ref>{{Cite ODNB|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-65661|title=Winch, Peter Guy (1926–1997), philosopher {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=D.

Following the outbreak of World War II, he served in the [[Royal Navy]] 1944–47, before graduating from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1949.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Palmer |first=Anthony |date=1997-06-02 |title=Obituary: Professor Peter Winch |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-peter-winch-1253947.html |url-access= |url-status= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220603055449/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-peter-winch-1253947.html |archive-date=3 June 2022 |access-date=2019-07-18 |website=[[The Independent]] |language=en}}</ref>

He was a lecturer in philosophy at the [[Swansea University]] from 1951 until 1964. He was influenced by his colleagues [[Rush Rhees]] and [[Roy Holland]], both experts in the philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. In 1964, he moved to [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]], before becoming Professor of Philosophy at [[King's College London]] in 1967. During this period, he served as president of [[Aristotelian Society]], from 1980 to 1981. In 1985 Winch moved to the United States to become Professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Phillips |first=D.

He died on the 27 April 1997, in [[Champaign, Illinois]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101207044137/https://www.iwm.at/files/nl-57.pdf ''Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'': ''Newsletter'' 57] p.33 Obituary (1997).(Archived on 7 December 2010)</ref>

He was survived by his wife Erika Neumann and his two sons, Christopher and David.

==Thought==
Major influences upon Winch include [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Rush Rhees]], [[R. G. Collingwood]] and [[Simone Weil]]. He gave rise to a form of philosophy that has been given the name 'sociologism'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The German tradition in philosophy.|last=Sutton, Claud, 1898-1972.|date=1974|publisher=Crane, Russak|isbn=0844802573|location=New York|oclc=892542}}</ref> He also bears responsibility for a small school of sociology that was prepared to accept his radical criticism of the subject.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New rules of sociological method : a positive critique of interpretative sociologies|last=Giddens, Anthony.|date=1993|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0804722250|edition=2nd|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=30154711}}</ref>

Winch saw himself as an uncompromising Wittgensteinian. He was not personally acquainted with Wittgenstein; Wittgenstein's influence upon him was mostly mediated through that of Rush Rhees, who was his colleague at the University College of Swansea, now known as [[Swansea University]], and whom Wittgenstein appointed as one of his literary executors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Peter Winch.|last=Lyas, Colin.|date=1999|publisher=Acumen|isbn=9781315710884|location=Durham|oclc=922958047}}</ref> Winch's translation of Wittgenstein's ''Vermischte Bemerkungen'' (as edited by [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]) was published in 1980 as ''[[Culture and Value]]'' (with a new translation by Winch of a revised edition by Alois Pichler appearing in 1998).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Joseph|date=2007|title=Culture and Value Revisited – Draft of a new electronic edition|url=http://wittgensteinrepository.org/agora-alws/article/view/2670/3064|journal=From the ALWS Archives: A Selection of Papers from the International Wittgenstein Symposia in Kirchberg Am Wechsel}}</ref>  After the death of Rhees in 1989, Winch took over his position as literary executor.

From Rush Rhees, Winch derived his interest in the religious writer Simone Weil. Part of the appeal was a break from Wittgenstein into a very different type of philosophy which could nevertheless be tackled with familiar methods.  Also Weil's ascetic, somewhat [[Tolstoy]]an, form of religion harmonised with one aspect of Wittgenstein's personality.

At a time when most Anglo-American philosophers were heavily under the spell of Wittgenstein, Winch's own approach was strikingly original.  While much of his work was concerned with rescuing Wittgenstein from what he took to be misreadings, his own philosophy involved a shift of emphasis from the problems that preoccupied Oxford style [[Ordinary language philosophy|‘linguistic’ philosophy]], towards justifying and explaining '[[Form of life (philosophy)|forms of life]]' in terms of consistent [[Language-game (philosophy)|language game]]s. He took Wittgensteinian philosophy into areas of [[ethics]] and religion, which Wittgenstein himself had relatively neglected, sometimes showing considerable originality. An example is his illuminating treatment of the moral difference between someone who tries and fails to commit murder and someone who succeeds, in his essay "Trying" in ''Ethics and Action''. With the decline of interest in Wittgenstein, Winch himself was increasingly neglected and the challenge his arguments presented to much contemporary philosophy was sidestepped or ignored. In insisting on the continuity of Wittgenstein's concerns from the ''Tractatus'' through to the ''Philosophical Investigations'', Winch made a powerful case for Wittgenstein's mature philosophy, as he understood it, as the consummation and legitimate heir of the entire analytic tradition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wittgenstein's place in twentieth-century analytic philosophy|last=Hacker, P. M. S. (Peter Michael Stephan)|date=1997|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631200983|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=33207191}}</ref>

Wittgenstein famously said that philosophy leaves the world as it is.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://topologicalmedialab.net/xinwei/classes/readings/Wittgenstein/pi_94-138_239-309.html|title=Wittgenstein: Philosophical Investigations|website=topologicalmedialab.net|access-date=2019-07-18|quote=124. Philosophy may in no way interfere with the actual use of language, it can in the end only describe it. For it cannot give it any foundation either. It leaves everything as it is...}}</ref> Winch takes his ideas into regions that have strong moral and political implications.
