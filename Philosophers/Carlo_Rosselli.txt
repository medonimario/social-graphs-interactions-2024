'''Carlo Alberto Rosselli''' (16 November 1899{{spaced ndash}}9 June 1937) was an Italian political leader, [[journalist]], [[historian]], [[philosopher]] and [[anti-fascist]] activist, first in [[Italy]] and then abroad. He developed a theory of [[reformist]], non-[[Marxist]] [[socialism]] inspired by the British [[labour movement]] that he described as "[[liberal socialism]]". Rosselli founded the anti-fascist militant movement {{lang|it|[[Giustizia e Libertà]]}}. Rosselli personally took part in combat in the [[Spanish Civil War]], where he served on the [[Republican Faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] side.<ref name=b1>Spencer Di Scala (1996).

== Life ==

=== Birth, war and studies ===
Rosselli was born in [[Rome]] to a wealthy [[History of the Jews in Italy#Tuscany|Tuscan Jewish]] family. His mother, [[Amelia Pincherle Rosselli]], had been active in [[Republicanism|republican]] politics and thought and had participated in the [[unification of Italy]]. She was also a playwright and children's book author. In 1903 he was taken to [[Florence]] with his mother and siblings. During the [[First World War]] he joined the [[Italian Armed Forces]] and fought in the alpine campaign, rising to the rank of [[second lieutenant]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiviorosselli.it/User.it/index.php?PAGE=Sito_it/CRosselli|title=Archivio della famiglia Rosselli|website=archiviorosselli.it|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527215631/http://www.archiviorosselli.it/User.it/index.php?PAGE=Sito_it%2FCRosselli|archive-date=27 May 2016}}</ref>

After the war, thanks to his brother [[Nello Rosselli|Nello]], he studied in Florence with [[Gaetano Salvemini]], who was to be from then a constant companion of both the Rosselli brothers. It was in this period that he became a [[socialist]], sympathetic to the [[reformist]] ideas of [[Filippo Turati]], in contrast to the revolutionary thinking of [[Giacinto Menotti Serrati]]. In 1921 he graduated with a degree in political sciences from the [[University of Florence]] with a thesis titled: "sindacalismo" ([[Syndicalism]]). Later he undertook a law degree that he would pursue in [[Turin]] and [[Milan]], where he met [[Luigi Einaudi]] and [[Piero Gobetti]].

He graduated in 1923 from the [[University of Siena]]. For some weeks he visited [[London]] where he studied the workings of the [[British Labour Party]]: the Labour movement in the UK would deeply influence him.

=== Rise of Fascism ===
An active supporter of the [[Unitary Socialist Party (Italy, 1922)|Unitary Socialist Party]] of Turati, [[Giacomo Matteotti|Matteotti]] and [[Claudio Treves|Treves]], he began writing for "[[Critica Sociale]]", a review edited by Turati. After the murder of Matteotti, Rosselli pushed for a more active opposition to [[Fascism]]. With the help of [[Ernesto Rossi (politician)|Ernesto Rossi]] and [[Gaetano Salvemini]] he founded the clandestine publication "Non mollare" (''Don't give up''). During the following months, fascist violence towards the left became increasingly severe. Ernesto Rossi left the country for [[France]], followed by Salvemini. On 15 February 1926, fellow activist [[Piero Gobetti]] died as an exile in [[Paris]] for the consequences of a fascist aggression which happened in [[Turin]] the year before. Still in Italy, Rosselli and [[Pietro Nenni]] founded the review "[[Quarto Stato]]", which was banned after a few months.

Later in 1926, he organized with [[Sandro Pertini]] and [[Ferruccio Parri]] the escape of Turati to France. While Pertini followed Turati to France, Parri and Rosselli were captured and convicted for their roles in Turati's escape and sentenced to a period of confinement on the island of [[Lipari]] (1927). It was then that Rosselli began to write his most famous work, "Liberal Socialism". In July 1929 he escaped to [[Tunisia]], from where he travelled to France, and the community of Italian antifascists including [[Emilio Lussu]] and [[Francesco Fausto Nitti]]. Nitti later portrayed Rosselli's adventurous escape in the book ''Le nostre prigioni e la nostra evasione'' (''Our Prisons and Our Escape'') in an Italian edition in 1946 (the 1929 [[English language|English]] first edition was titled ''Escape'').

===Exile in Paris and Giustizia e Libertà===
[[File:Flag of Giustizia e Liberta.svg|thumb|right|Flag of ''[[Giustizia e Libertà]]'', an Italian anti-fascist resistance movement founded and initially led by Rosselli.]]
In 1929, with [[Alberto Cianca|Cianca]], Lussu, Nitti, and a Parisian circle of refugees which had formed around Salvemini, Rosselli helped found the anti-fascist movement "[[Giustizia e Libertà]]".<ref name=mros>{{cite journal|author=Marion Roselli|title=Headliners: Alberto Tarchiani|journal=Free World|date=1945|volume=35|page=31
|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/freewrld9&i=233}}</ref> GL various numbers of the review and the notebooks omonimi (with cadence weekly magazine and salary) and was active in the organization of various spectacular actions, notable among which was the flight over Milan of Bassanesi (1930). In 1930 he published, in French, "Socialisme Libéral".

The book was at once a passionate critique of [[Marxism]], a creative synthesis of the [[democratic socialist]] [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]] (Bernstein, Turati and Treves) and of classical Italian [[Liberalism]] ([[Benedetto Croce]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rizi|first1=Fabio Fernando |title=Benedetto Croce and Italian Fascism |date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=136–139}}</ref> Francisco Saverio Merlino and [[Gaetano Salvemini]]). But it contained also a shattering attack on the [[Stalinism]] of the [[Third International]], which had, with the derisive formula of "social fascism", lumped together [[social democracy]], [[bourgeois]] liberalism and fascism. It was not surprising, therefore, when one of the most important Italian Communists, [[Palmiro Togliatti|Togliatti]], defined "liberal Socialism" as "libellous anti-socialism" and Rosselli "a reactionary ideologue who has nothing to do with the working class".

Giustizia e Libertà joined the [[Concentrazione Antifascista Italiana]] (The Italian Anti-Fascist Concentration), a union of all the non-communist anti-fascist forces (republican, socialist, nationalist) trying to promote and coordinate expatriate actions to fight fascism in Italy. They also first published a weekly political magazine entitled ''[[Giustizia e Libertà (magazine)|Giustizia e Libertà]]''. Rosselli was the founding editor of the weekly and served in the post from 1934 to 1937.<ref name=micc/> Following his assassination in 1937 Alberto Cianca replaced him in the post.<ref name=micc>{{cite journal|author=Michele Cantarella|title=Italian Writers in Exile: A Bibliography

After the advent of [[Nazism]] in Germany (1933), the paper began to call for insurgency, revolutionary action, and military action in order to stop the Italian and German regimes before they plunge Europe into a tragic war. Spain, they wrote, seems the destiny of all fascist states.

=== Spanish Civil War ===
In July 1936, the [[Spanish Civil War]] erupted as the fascist-monarchical led army attempted a coup d'état against the republican government of the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]]. Rosselli helped lead the Italian anti-fascist supporters of the [[Spanish Republican Army|republican forces]], criticizing the neutrality policy of France and Britain, especially as Italy and Germany sent arms and troops in support of the rebels. In August, Rosselli and the GL organized their own brigades of volunteers to support the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].

With [[Camillo Berneri]], Rosselli headed the [[Matteotti Battalion]], a mixed volunteer unit of [[anarchist]], [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[socialist]] and [[communist]] Italians. The unit was sent to the [[Aragon front]], and participated in a victory against [[Francoist]] forces in the [[Battle of Monte Pelato]]. Speaking on Barcelona Radio in November, Rosselli made famous the slogan: "Oggi in Spagna, domani in Italia" ("Today in Spain, tomorrow in Italy").

After falling ill, Rosselli was sent back to Paris, from where he led support for the anti-fascist cause, and proposed an even broader '[[popular front]]' while still remaining critical of the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] and the Soviet government of [[Joseph Stalin]]. In 1937, Berneri was killed by Communist forces during a purge of anarchists in [[Barcelona]]. With the fall of the Spanish Republic in 1939, [[Giustizia e Libertà]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] were forced to flee back to France.

=== Murder ===
In June 1937, Carlo Rosselli and his brother visited the French resort town of [[Bagnoles-de-l'Orne]]. On 9 June, the two were killed by a group of ''cagoulards'', militants of the [[La Cagoule|Cagoule]], a [[History of the far-right in France|French fascist group]], with archival documents implicating Mussolini's regime in authorizing the murder.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pugliese|first1=Stanislao G.|title=Carlo Rosselli: Socialist Heretic and Antifascist Exile |url=https://archive.org/details/carlorossellisoc00pugl |url-access=registration |date=1999 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/carlorossellisoc00pugl/page/221 221]|isbn=978-0-674-00053-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Stanislao G.

==Thought==
Carlo Rosselli published only one book, ''Liberal Socialism''. This work marked Rosselli out as a heretic in the Italian left of his time (for which [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]'', albeit variously understood, was still regarded as the only reliable source of political analysis and guidance). Undoubtedly the influence of the British labour movement, which he knew well, is visible. As a result of the electoral successes of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], Rosselli was convinced that the 'norms' of liberal democracy were essential, not only in building Socialism, but also for its concrete realization. This stands in contrast to [[Leninist]] tactics which prioritize organizational power over democratic procedures. This 'Rossellian' synthesis is that "[parliamentary] liberalism is the method, Socialism is the aim".

The [[Marxist–Leninist]] idea of revolution founded on the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (which he felt, as in the Russian case, was synonymous with the dictatorship of a single party) he rejected in favour of a revolution that—as famously put in the GL program—is a coherent system of structural reforms aimed at the construction of a Socialism; that does not limit, but indeed exalts, freedom of personality and of association. Writing in his final years, Rosselli became more radical in his liberal positions, defending the social organization of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT-FAI]] he had seen in [[anarchist Catalonia]] and Barcelona during the civil war, and informed by the rise of [[Nazi Germany]].
