'''Heinrich Scholz''' ({{IPA|de|ʃɔlts|lang}}; 17 December 1884 – 30 December 1956) was a German [[logic]]ian, [[philosopher]], and [[Protestant]] [[Theology|theologian]]. He was a peer of [[Alan Turing]] who mentioned Scholz when writing with regard to the reception of "[[On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]]":<ref name="Turing-1937-ONC">Alan Turing: "[[On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]]." In: ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'', 2nd series, vol. 42 (1937), pp. 230–265.</ref> "I have had two letters asking for reprints, one from [[R. B. Braithwaite|Braithwaite]] at King's and one from a professor [sic] in Germany... They seemed very much interested in the paper. [...] I was disappointed by its reception here."

Scholz had an extraordinary career (he was considered an outstanding scientist of national importance) but was not considered a brilliant logician, for example on the same level as [[Gottlob Frege]] or [[Rudolf Carnap]]. He provided a suitable academic environment for his students to thrive. He founded the Institute of Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Research at the University of Münster in 1936, which can be said enabled the study of logic at the highest international level after [[World War II]] up until the present day.<ref name="Scholz2">Hans-Christoph Schmidt am Busch and [[Kai Wehmeier|Kai F.

==Personal life==
Herman Scholz father was a protestant minister at [[St. Mary's Church, Berlin]].<ref name="Menzler-Trott2007">{{cite book|author=Eckart Menzler-Trott|title=Logic's Lost Genius: The Life of Gerhard Gentzen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXWGKlLTkqoC&pg=PA183|date=1 January 2007|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-9129-2|pages=183–}}</ref> From 1903 to 1907 he studied philosophy and theology at [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen University]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] achieving a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] in theology (Lic. theol.).  He was a student of [[Adolf von Harnack]], in philosophy with peers [[Alois Riehl]] and [[Friedrich Paulsen]]. On 28 July 1910, Scholz [[Habilitation|habilitated]] in the subjects of [[religious philosophy]] and [[systematic theology]] in Berlin, and was promoted to full [[professor]], therein working as a lecturer.<ref name="St Andrews">{{cite web |url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Scholz.html |title = History of Heinrich Scholz |publisher = School of Mathematics and Statistics University of St Andrews, Scotland  |date = July 2009 |website = University of St Andrews |access-date= 15 Dec 2012 }}</ref> In 1913, at Erlangen, Heinrich Scholz took his examination for promotion of [[Doctor of Philosophy|Dr. phil.]] with [[Richard Falckenberg]], studying the work of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] with a thesis titled: ''Schleiermacher und Goethe. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des deutschen Geistes.''<ref>{{Citation | last= Scholz | first= Heinrich | year= 1913 | title=  Schleiermacher und Goethe. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des deutschen Geistes | trans-title= [[Schleiermacher]] and [[Goethe]]: A Contribution to the History of the German Spirit | type= Dissertation | publisher= J. C. Hinrichs | location= Leipzig | language= de | display-authors= 0 }}</ref> In 1917 he was appointed to the chair  of Philosophy of Religion at the [[University of Wrocław|Breslau]] succeeding [[Rudolf Otto]] to teach religious philosophy and systematic theology. In the same year he married his fiancée, Elisabeth Orth. Due to 8 years of continuous gastric trouble, he was exempted from military service. In 1919, he underwent an operation in which he believed to be a large part of his stomach was removed. That year he took the call to [[University of Kiel|Kiel University]], as the chair of philosophy. It was while at Kiel, in 1924, that Scholz's first wife, Elisabeth Orth died.<ref name="St Andrews"/>

From October 1928 onwards, he taught in [[University of Münster|Münster University]], first as ''Professor of Philosophy''. In 1938, this was changed to ''Professor of Philosophy of Mathematics and Science'' and again in 1943 to ''Chair of Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Questions in Mathematics'' working as head of the Institute for Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Research at Münster<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/logik/org/en/ |title=Institute of Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Research|publisher=University of Münster |access-date=15 Dec 2013 }}</ref> until he retired in 1952 as professor emeritus.<ref name="St Andrews"/>

Scholz was survived by his second wife, Erna.  Scholz grave is located on the Park Cemetery Eichhof near Kiel.

==Career==
From his own account, in 1921, having by accident came across [[Principia Mathematica]] by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] he began studying logic, which he had abandoned in his youth to study theology, leading later to a study of mathematics and theoretical physics by taking an undergraduate degree at Kiel.<ref name="Scholz2" />  However another factor in his change of focus was the mathematician [[Otto Toeplitz]].<ref name="St Andrews"/> Toeplitz's broad research interests including [[Hilbert space]]s and [[spectral theory]] encouraged Scholz interest in mathematics. Indeed, Segal<ref name="St Andrews"/><ref>{{cite book |last= Segal |first=S. L. |year= 2003 |title=Mathematicians under the Nazis |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn= 9780691164632}}</ref> suggests that Scholz love of structure was also an important factor in his move into mathematical logic, describing it this:

''Scholz's feeling for structure was no small thing. He apparently felt that when having guests for dinner: (1) no more than six people should be invited; (2) there must be an excellent menu; (3) a discussion theme must be planned; and (4) the guests should have prepared themselves as much as possible beforehand on this theme.''

In 1925, he was a peer of [[Karl Barth]] at Münster University, in which he taught [[Protestantism|Protestant theology]]. Under the influence of conversations with Scholz,  Barth later wrote in 1930/31. his book about the [[Anselm of Canterbury]] proof of God  "''fides quaerens intellectum''."

In the 1930s, he maintained contact<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.turingarchive.org/viewer/?id=155&title=16 |title=Typed Postcard, Heinrich Scholz. 11 Feb.&nbsp;1937. |publisher=The Turing Digital Archive |access-date=23 January 2019 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.turingarchive.org/viewer/?id=155&title=17 |title=Typed Postcard, Heinrich Scholz. 5 Mar.&nbsp;1937. |publisher=The Turing Digital Archive |access-date=23 January 2019 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> with Alan Turing who later – in a letter home dated 22 February 1937 – wrote with regard to the reception of his article "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem":<ref name="Turing-1937-ONC" /> {{blockquote |I have had two letters asking for reprints, one from [[R. B. Braithwaite|Braithwaite]] at King's and one from a proffessor [sic] in Germany... They seemed very much interested in the paper. I think possibly it is making a certain amount of impression. I was disappointed by its reception here.

At the [[University of Münster]], his study into mathematical logic and basic research, provided many of the critical insights, that contributed to the foundations of [[theoretical computer science]].<ref name="Scholz2" /> Right from the time he arrived at Münster, Scholz worked towards building a school of mathematical logic.<ref name="St Andrews" /> By 1935, his research team at Münster were being referred to as the ''Münster school of mathematical logic''.<ref name="St Andrews" /> Scholz names 1936, as the year the ''Münster School'' was born.<ref name="Menzler-Trott2007" />  His professorship was rededicated in 1936 to a lectureship for mathematical logic and fundamental research  and in 1943 the first chair in Germany for mathematical logic and fundamental research. The Münster Chair is still regarded as one of the best in Germany.

Scholz was considered a [[Platonism|Platonist]], and in that sense, he regarded the mathematical logic as the foundation of knowledge. In 1936 he was awarded a grant from the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]], for the production of three volumes of research in logic and for the editing of the [[Gottlob Frege]] papers. He is considered the discoverer of the estate of [[Gottlob Frege]].<ref>Kai F. Wehmeier and Hans-Christoph Schmidt am Busch, "In Search of Frege's estate." In: Gottlob Frege: Works and Impact, ed. by G. Gabriel and U. Dathe, mentis Verlag, Paderborn 2005, 267–281.</ref>

[[Gisbert Hasenjaeger]] whose thesis had been supervised by Scholtz, produced a book ''Grundzüge der mathematischen Logik'' in 1961 which was jointly authored with Scholz despite being published five years after Scholz's death.<ref name="St Andrews" />

===Work during World War II===
Initially Scholz was pleased with the rise of [[Nazism|Nazi]] power in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Describing himself a conservative nationalist, describing himself as such "We felt like Prussians right to the bone,""<ref name="Menzler-Trott2007" /> and described by his friend [[Heinrich Behnke]] as a "small-minded Prussian nationalist".<ref name="St Andrews" /> Behnke found discussing political issues difficult. In the beginning the Nazi laws helped establish Münster as an important centre for Logic as other university staff at Göttingen and Berlin Universities were being obliterated.

On 14 March 1940, Scholz sent a letter to the Education department of occupied Poland, seeking the release of Jan Salamucha,<ref name="St Andrews" /> who had been professor of theology at [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]]. Salamucha was sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] in 1940. In October 1940, Scholz received a reply for the education minister which stated he had "injured the national honour" and was forbidden to send further petitions.<ref>[https://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/historie/kapitel52.pdf Vita] at Uni Münster (in German, p.111-118 = p.23-30 in the pdf document), here: p.114-115 = p.26-27</ref> Salamucha was later released but killed by the Nazis in 1944<ref name="St Andrews" /> However, Scholz persisted, first helping [[Alfred Tarski]], who had fled Poland to the United States, to correspond with his wife who remained in Poland and later helping the Polish Logician [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], who he had been corresponding since 1928, to leave Poland with his wife and hide in Germany.<ref name="St Andrews" />

Although Scholz recognized the true nature of the Nazis and abhorred them from mid-1942 onwards, he  remained on good terms with Nazi academics like [[Ludwig Bieberbach]].<ref name="St Andrews" /> During the period of National Socialism, Max Steck, who championed the ''German Mathematics'' which rejected the formalist approach to mathematics, deeply opposed [[David Hilbert|Hilbert's]] approach which he described as Jewish – the worst possible insult in Germany at this time.<ref name="St Andrews" /> Max Steck acknowledged the "per se outstanding achievement of formalism" ("an sich betrachtet einmaligen Leistung des Formalismus"), but criticized the "missing epistemological component" ("Jede eigentliche Erkenntnistheorie fehlt im Formalismus")<ref>Max Steck: "Mathematik als Begriff und Gestalt" (i.e. "Mathematics as concept and model"), Max Niemeyer Verlag, Halle (Saale), 1942, pages 27, 28.</ref> and on the only page of his main work where he connects formalism and Jews he mentions that "Jews were the actual trendsetters of formalism" ("die eigentlichen Schrittmacher des Formalismus").<ref>Max Steck: "Das Hauptproblem der Mathematik", 2nd extended edition, Dr. Georg Lüttke Verlag, Berlin 1943, page 204</ref> In response to this, Bieberbach asked Scholz to write an article for [[Deutsche Mathematik]],  to answer the attacks on [[Formalism (mathematics)|mathematical formalism]] by Steck, which was surprising since Bieberbach led the Nazi mathematicians' attack on Jewish mathematics. Ensuring that Hilbert was not considered "Jewish", Scholz wrote "What does formalised study of the foundations of mathematics aim at?."<ref name="St Andrews" /><ref>{{cite journal | author=Heinrich Scholz | title=Was will die formalisierte Grundlagenforschung? | journal=Deutsche Mathematik | volume=7 | number=2/3 | pages=206–248 | date=Jul 1943 }}</ref> Scholz had received funding from Bieberbach as early as 1937, which prompted an annoyed Steck to write in his 1942 book:

{{blockquote|What Scholz has understood is doubtless this, to obtain from the German State huge amounts of publication money for this logic production. We fundamentally reject this logic which praises the English empiricists and sensory philosophers such as the Englishmen Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and by now find it really time to speak for once about the "Great Germans".<ref name="St Andrews" /><ref>Max Steck, Das Hauptproblem der Mathematik, 2nd edition, Georg Lüttke Verlag, Berlin, 1943, page 157; direct quotation from Max Steck's book: "What Scholz has understood is doubtless this, to renounce the statements of the first edition of our book as belonging to the history of thought and turn personal. We fundamentally reject this formal mathematical logic, which praises the English empiricists and sensory philosophers such as "the Great Englishmen Locke, Berkeley, Hume" (Heinrich Scholz on page 15), and by now find it really time to speak for once about the "Great Germans"." (Original German text by Max Steck: ''"Was er verstanden hat ist zweifellos dies, die Darlegungen der 1. Auflage unseres Buches als geistesgeschichtliche Entwicklungen abzustreiten und ins Persönliche zu verbiegen. Wir lehnen grundsätzlich diese Logik, die die englischen Empiristen und Sensualisten als die "großen Engländer, Locke, Berkeley, Hume" priest (so Heinrich Scholz ibid. S. 15) ab und finden es nachgerade an der Zeit, einmal von den "Großen Deutschen" zu sprechen."'')</ref>}}

There were three other articles by Heinrich Scholz in the journal ''German Mathematics'': ''Ein neuer Vollständigkeitsbeweis für das reduzierte Fregesche Axiomensystem des Aussagenkalküls'' (1936), a review of the Nazi philosopher Wolfgang Cramer's book ''Das Problem der reinen Anschauung'' (1938) and a review of [[Andreas Speiser]]'s ''Ein Parmenideskommentar'' (1938).

==World's first computer science seminar==
In the late 2000s, Achim Clausing<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cs.uni-muenster.de/u/cl/|title = Prof. Dr. Achim Clausing|location=Münster|publisher=Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster|date=2 April 2022|access-date=2 April 2022}}</ref> was tasked with going through the remaining estate of Scholz at Münster University, and while going through the archive papers in the basement of the Institute of Computer Science,  Clausing discovered two original prints of the most important publication of Alan Turing, which had been missing since 1945.<ref name="Scholz5">{{cite news  |date=28 Jan 2013 |title=In the footsteps of a pioneer: In the University Library Münster are original prints of the computer scientist Alan Turing |newspaper=Westfälische Nachrichten |location=Münster |publisher= Westfälische Nachrichten Elmar Ries}}</ref> In this case, the work "[[On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]]" from 1936, which Scholz had requested, and a postcard from Turing.  Based on the work by Turing and conversations with Scholz,  Clausing stated "[it was] the world's first [[seminar]] on computer science."  The second work, which was a Mind (journal) article,  dates from 1950 and is a treatise on the development of [[artificial intelligence]], Turing provided them with a handwritten comment. ''This is probably my last copy''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cs.uni-muenster.de/u/cl/img/turingbig.jpg |title=Computing Machinery and Intelligence |last1=Turing |first1=Alan|date= Oct 1950 |website=Institute of Computer Science, University of Münster |publisher=Mind, A Quarterly Review of Psychology and Philosophy Vol LIX No 236 |access-date=15 December 2013}}</ref>   At [[Sotheby's]] recently, comparable prints of Turing, with no attached dedication, sold for 180,000 euros.
