==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Churchland was born Patricia Smith in [[Oliver, British Columbia]],<ref name=":0" /> and raised on a farm in the [[South Okanagan]] valley.<ref name="doctor of law" /><ref name="Pat and Paul interview" />  Both of her parents lacked a high-school education; her father and mother left school after grades 6 and 8 respectively.  Her mother was a nurse and her father worked in newspaper publishing in addition to running the family farm.  In spite of their limited education, Churchland has described her parents as interested in the sciences, and the worldview they instilled in her as a secular one.  She has also described her parents as eager for her to attend college, and though many farmers in their community thought this "hilarious and a grotesque waste of money", they saw to it that she did so.<ref name="Pat and Paul interview">{{cite web|title=From the Engine of Reason to the Seat of the Soul: A Brain-Wise Conversation|url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-science-studio/from-the-engine-of-reason-to-the-seat-of-the-soul-a-brain-wise-conversation|work=The Science Studio|publisher=[[The Science Network]]|access-date=30 August 2011|format=video|date=26 June 2006}}</ref>   She took her undergraduate degree at the [[University of British Columbia]], graduating with [[honours degree|honors]] in 1965.<ref name=CV />  She received a [[Woodrow Wilson Fellowship]] to study at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where she took an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1966.<ref name=CV /><ref name="Wilson fellow">{{cite web|title=Fellows Of Note - Major Awards|url=http://www.woodrow.org/about_fellows/awards.php|publisher=The [[Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation]]|access-date=30 August 2011|location=Princeton, NJ|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928153453/http://www.woodrow.org/about_fellows/awards.php|archive-date=28 September 2011}}</ref> Thereafter she studied at [[Somerville College, Oxford]] as a [[British Council]] and [[Canada Council]] Fellow, obtaining a [[Bachelor of Philosophy|B. Phil]] in 1969.<ref name=CV />

===Academic career===
Churchland's first academic appointment was at the [[University of Manitoba]], where she was an assistant professor from 1969 to 1977, an associate professor from 1977 to 1982, and promoted to a full professorship in 1983.<ref name=CV />   It was here that she began to make a formal study of [[neuroscience]] with the help and encouragement of Larry Jordan, a professor with a lab in the Department of Physiology there.<ref name="doctor of law" /><ref name="Pat and Paul interview" /><ref name="Jordan lab">{{cite web|title=Faculty of Medicine - Physiology|url=http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/medicine/physiology/contacts/jordan.html|publisher=University of Manitoba - Department of Physiology|access-date=30 August 2011|format=web page}}</ref>  From 1982 to 1983 she was a Visiting Member in Social Science at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton.<ref name="IAS soc sci scholars">{{cite web|title=Social Science Only|url=http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/affiliation/socsci37b1.html?page=2&%24Version=1&%24Path=%2F|work=A Community of Scholars|publisher=Institute for Advanced Study|access-date=30 August 2011|location=Princeton, NJ|quote=Churchland, Patricia Smith [V] SocSci 1982-83|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319043513/http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/affiliation/socsci37b1.html?page=2&%24Version=1&%24Path=%2F|archive-date=19 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>   In 1984, she was invited to take up a professorship in the department of philosophy at [[University of California, San Diego|UCSD]], and relocated there with her husband Paul, where both have remained since.<ref name="Paul Churchland CV">{{cite web|last=Churchland|first=Paul M.|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/pchurchland/cv.pdf|publisher=UCSD Philosophy Department|access-date=30 August 2011|date=19 January 2007}}</ref>  Since 1989, she has also held an adjunct professorship at the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies|Salk Institute]] adjacent to UCSD's campus, where she became acquainted with [[Jonas Salk]]<ref name="Salk faculty" /><ref name="doctor of law" /> whose name the Institute bears.  Describing Salk, Churchland has said that he "liked the idea of neurophilosophy, and he gave me a tremendous amount of encouragement at a time when many other people thought that we were, frankly, out to lunch."<ref name="Pat and Paul interview" />  Another important supporter Churchland found at the Salk Institute was [[Francis Crick]].<ref name="doctor of law" /><ref name="Pat and Paul interview" />     At the Salk Institute, Churchland has worked with [[Terrence Sejnowski]]'s lab as a research collaborator.<ref name="Salk people">{{cite web|title=CNL - People|url=http://cnl.salk.edu/People/|work=Computational Neurobiology Laboratory|publisher=The Salk Institute|access-date=30 August 2011|format=web page}}</ref>   Her collaboration with Sejnowski culminated in a book, ''The Computational Brain'' (MIT Press, 1993), co-authored with Sejnowski.  Churchland was named the UC President's Professor of Philosophy in 1999, and served as Chair of the Philosophy Department at UCSD from 2000-2007.<ref name=CV />

She attended and was a speaker at the [[secularism|secularist]] [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival|Beyond Belief]] symposia in 2006, 2007, and 2008.<ref name="Bbelief 2006">{{cite web|title=Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival|url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-science-religion-reason-and-survival|publisher=The Science Network|access-date=14 August 2011|format=web page and video|date=5–7 November 2006}}</ref><ref name="Bbelief 2007">{{cite web|title=Beyond Belief: Enlightenment 2.0|url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-enlightenment-2-0|publisher=The Science Network|format=web page and video|date=31 October – 2 November 2007}}</ref><ref name="Bbelief 2008">{{cite web|title=Beyond Belief: Candles in the Dark|url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-candles-in-the-dark|publisher=The Science Network|access-date=14 August 2011|format=web page and video|date=3–6 October 2008}}</ref>

===Personal life===

Churchland first met her husband, the philosopher [[Paul Churchland]], while they were both enrolled in a class on [[Plato]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]],<ref name="Pat and Paul interview"/> and they were married after she completed her B.Phil at [[Somerville College, Oxford]].<ref name="doctor of law" />  Their children are Mark M. Churchland (born 1972) and [[Anne K.

==Philosophical work==
Churchland is broadly allied to a view of philosophy as a kind of 'proto-science' - asking challenging but largely empirical questions. She advocates the scientific endeavour, and has dismissed significant swathes of professional philosophy as obsessed with what she regards as unnecessary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nousthepodcast.libsyn.com/patricia-churchland-on-how-we-evolved-a-conscience|title=NOUS: Patricia Churchland on How We Evolved A Conscience|website=nousthepodcast.libsyn.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-21|archive-date=2019-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190918101630/http://nousthepodcast.libsyn.com/patricia-churchland-on-how-we-evolved-a-conscience|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Churchland's own work has focused on the interface between [[neuroscience]] and philosophy. According to her, philosophers are increasingly realizing that to understand the mind one must understand the brain. She applies findings from neuroscience to address traditional philosophical questions about knowledge, free will, consciousness and ethics. She is associated with a school of thought called [[eliminative materialism]], which argues that common sense, immediately intuitive, or "[[folk psychology|folk psychological]]" concepts such as [[thought]], [[free will]], and [[consciousness]] will likely need to be revised in a physically [[reductionistic]] way as neuroscientists discover more about the nature of brain function.<ref name="phil bites">{{cite web|title=Pat Churchland on Eliminative Materialism|url=http://traffic.libsyn.com/philosophybites/ChurchlandMixSesNewW.mp3|publisher=Philosophy Bites|access-date=14 August 2011|author=Warburton, Nigel|author2=Edmonds, David|format=audio|year=2010}}</ref>
2014 saw a brief exchange of views on these topics with [[Colin McGinn]] in the pages of the ''New York Review Of Books''.<ref>{{Cite magazine | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jun/19/brains-and-minds-exchange/ | title=Of Brains & Minds: An Exchange &#124; Patricia Churchland | last1=McGinn | first1=Colin | last2=Churchland | first2=Patricia }}</ref>
