=="Some Meanings of Vague" (1937)==

In his article "Some Meanings of Vague",<ref>''Analysis'', Vol. 4, No. 6 (Aug. 1937), pp. 89–95, Published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Analysis Committee.</ref> Aldrich puts forth a series of definitions of [[vagueness|vague]] objects and [[sensum]] and then argues that any empiricist must account for vague sensum every bit as much as clear sensum, without skirting the issue.  He takes there to be many kinds of vagueness—importantly, there is the vagueness of symbols and vagueness of senses.  Here, symbols are anything that is used to refer to, including verbal words, signs, pictures, and more.  Vagueness regarding symbols can be the same as the vagueness which regards the senses.  There can, additionally, be vagueness of the practices surrounding the use of the symbol to refer.  These, he suggests, should be avoided.
