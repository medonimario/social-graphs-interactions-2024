'''Leszek Kołakowski''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|k|ɒ|f|s|k|i}}; {{IPA|pl|ˈlɛʂɛk kɔwaˈkɔfskʲi|lang}}; 23 October 1927 [[Radom]] – 17 July 2009 [[Oxford]]) was a Polish philosopher and [[historian of ideas]]. He is best known for his critical analyses of [[Marxism|Marxist]] thought, such as in his three-volume history of Marxist philosophy ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]]'' (1976). In his later work, Kołakowski increasingly focused on religious questions. In his 1986 [[Jefferson Lecture]], he asserted that "we learn history not in order to know how to behave or how to succeed, but to know who we are".<ref name="Idolatry 1">Leszek Kołakowski, "The Idolatry of Politics,"  reprinted in ''Modernity on Endless Trial'' (University of Chicago Press, 1990, paperback edition 1997), {{ISBN|0-226-45045-7}}, {{ISBN|0-226-45046-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-226-45046-9}}, p. 158.</ref>

Due to his [[criticism of Marxism]] and of the [[Communist state]] system, Kołakowski was effectively exiled from [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] in 1968. He spent most of the remainder of his career at [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. Despite being in exile, Kołakowski was a major inspiration for the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] that flourished in Poland in the 1980s<ref>Roger Kimball, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170204152600/http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/leszek-1063 Leszek Kołakowski and the Anatomy of Totalitarianism].

== Life and career ==
=== Early life and education ===
Kołakowski was born in [[Radom]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. He could not obtain formal schooling during the [[German occupation of Poland in World War II|German occupation of Poland]] (1939–1945) in [[World War II]], but he read books and took occasional private lessons, passing his school-leaving examinations as an external student in the [[Polish Underground State|underground]] [[Education in Poland during World War II|school system]]. After the war, he studied philosophy at both [[University of Łódź]] and [[University of Warsaw]], the latter of which he completed a doctorate at in 1953, focusing on [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] from a Marxist viewpoint.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/leszek-kolakowski-polish-born-philosopher-and-writer-who-produced-seminal-critical-analyses-on-1763959.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220614/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/leszek-kolakowski-polish-born-philosopher-and-writer-who-produced-seminal-critical-analyses-on-1763959.html |archive-date=14 June 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Leszek Kolakowski: Polish-born philosopher and writer who produced|date=29 July 2009|website=Independent.co.uk|access-date=3 February 2018}}</ref> He served as a professor and chair of Warsaw University's department of History of Philosophy from 1959 to 1968.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/leszek-kolakowski-polish-born-philosopher-and-writer-who-produced-seminal-critical-analyses-on-1763959.html |title=Leszek Kolakowski: Polish-born philosopher and writer who produced seminal critical analyses on Marxism and religion |website=independent.co.uk |author=[[George Gomori (writer)|George Gömöri]] |date=29 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414093312/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/leszek-kolakowski-polish-born-philosopher-and-writer-who-produced-seminal-critical-analyses-on-1763959.html |access-date=22 May 2023|archive-date=14 April 2016 }}</ref>

In his youth, Kołakowski became a [[communist]]. He signed a denunciation against [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polityka.pl/tygodnikpolityka/kraj/297351,1,piec-lat-temu-zmarl-leszek-kolakowski.read|title=Pięć lat temu zmarł Leszek Kołakowski|date=21 July 2009}}</ref> In 1945, he joined the Association of Fighting Youth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.eurozine.com/leszek-kolakowskis-political-path/ |title=Leszek Kołakowski's political path |author=Andrzej Friszke and Tadeusz Koczanowicz |website=eurozine.com |date=23 April 2018 |access-date=22 May 2023}}</ref> From 1947 to 1966, he was a member of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]]. His intellectual promise earned him a trip to Moscow in 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/5873129/Leszek-Kolakowski.html|title=Leszek Kolakowski|date=20 July 2009|access-date=3 February 2018|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>  He broke with [[Stalinism]], becoming a [[revisionist Marxist]] advocating a [[humanist]] interpretation of [[Karl Marx]]. One year after the 1956 [[Polish October]], Kołakowski published a four-part critique of [[Soviet Marxist]] dogmas, including [[historical determinism]], in the Polish periodical ''{{ill|Nowa Kultura|pl|Nowa_Kultura_(1950–1963)|lt=Nowa Kultura.}}''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111101030301/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862761,00.html Foreign News: VOICE OF DISSENT], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 14 October 1957</ref> His public lecture at Warsaw University on the tenth anniversary of Polish October led to his expulsion from the [[Polish United Workers' Party]].

He came to the conclusion that the totalitarian cruelty of [[Stalinism]] was not an aberration but a logical end-product of [[Marxism]], whose genealogy he examined in his monumental ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]]'', his major work, published in 1976 to 1978.<ref>Gareth Jones (17 July 2009) [https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE56G67Q20090717 "Polish philosopher and author Kołakowski dead at 81"].

=== Career ===
Kołakowski became increasingly fascinated by the contribution that theological assumptions make to [[Western culture]] and, in particular, [[modern era|modern]] thought. For example, he began his ''Main Currents of Marxism'' with an analysis of the contribution that various forms of ancient and medieval Platonism made, centuries later, to the [[Hegelian]] view of history. In the work, he criticized the laws of [[dialectical materialism#Philosophical evaluations|dialectical materialism]] for being fundamentally flawed and found some of them being "truisms with no specific Marxist content", others "philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means" but others being just "nonsense".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Main Currents of Marxism|last = Kołakowski|first = Leszek|publisher = W. W. Norton and Company|year = 2005|isbn = 9780393329438|location = New York|pages = 909}}</ref>

Kołakowski defended the role which [[freedom of will]] plays in the human quest for the [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]]. His ''Law of the Infinite Cornucopia'' asserted a doctrine of ''[[status quaestionis]]'': for any given doctrine that one wants to believe, there is never a shortage of arguments by which one can support it.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Religion|last = Kołakowski|first = Leszek|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1982|asin = B01JXSH3HM|location = New York}}, p.16</ref> Nevertheless, although human fallibility implies that we ought to treat claims to infallibility with scepticism, our pursuit of the higher (such as truth and goodness) is ennobling.

In 1965, Kołakowski, [[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] drew up a report on the meaning of the concept of message, which was used by the defence in the trial of [[Jacek Kuroń]] and [[Karol Modzelewski]] who were charged by the communist authorities with "propagating false information" in their ''Open Letter to the Party''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://historia.interia.pl/aktualnosci/news-list-otwarty-do-partii-kuronia-i-modzelewskiego,nId,2571159 |language=pl |title= "List otwarty do Partii" Kuronia i Modzelewskiego |website=interia.pl |author=Roman Graczyk |date=19 April 2018 |access-date=22 May 2023}}</ref>

In 1968, Kołakowski became a visiting professor in the Department of Philosophy at [[McGill University]] in Montreal and in 1969 he moved to the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://dzieje.pl/postacie/leszek-kolakowski-1927-2009 |language=pl |title=Leszek Kołakowski (1927-2009) |date=15 February 2021 |access-date=22 May 2023}}</ref> In 1970, he became a senior research fellow at [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. He remained mostly at Oxford, but he spent part of 1974 at [[Yale University]], and from 1981 to 1994, he was a part-time professor at the [[Committee on Social Thought]] and in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/author/K/L/au5092486.html |title=Leszek Kołakowski |website=press.uchicago.edu |access-date=22 May 2023}}</ref>

Although the Polish Communist authorities officially banned his works in Poland, underground copies of them influenced the opinions of the Polish intellectual opposition.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0312/kluge2.html Leszek Kolakowski: Scholar and Activist The Long Career of the Kluge Prize Winner], ''Library of Congress Information Bulletin'', December 2003.</ref>  His 1971 essay ''Theses on Hope and Hopelessness'' (full title: ''In Stalin's Countries: Theses on Hope and Despair''),<ref>Leszek Kołakowski (1971): Hope and Hopelessness.

Kołakowski maintained throughout his life and career a view of Marxism that was distinct from that of existing political regimes, and he relentlessly disputed these differences and defended his own interpretation of Marxism. In a famous article entitled "What is Left of Socialism", he wrote <blockquote>The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia had nothing to do with Marxian prophesies. Its driving force was not a conflict between the industrial working class and capital, but rather was carried out under slogans that had no socialist, let alone Marxist, content: Peace and land for peasants. There is no need to mention that these slogans were to be subsequently turned into their opposite. What in the twentieth century perhaps comes closest to the working class revolution were the events in Poland of 1980-81: the revolutionary movement of industrial workers (very strongly supported by the intelligentsia) against the exploiters, that is to say, the state. And this solitary example of a working class revolution (if even this may be counted) was directed against a socialist state, and carried out under the sign of the cross, with the blessing of the Pope.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2002/10/what-is-left-of-socialism |title = What Is Left of Socialism by Leszek Kolakowski {{!}} Articles {{!}} First Things| date=October 2002 }}</ref></blockquote>

=== Reception in Poland ===
In Poland, Kołakowski is regarded as a philosopher and [[historian of ideas]] but also as an icon for [[anti-communism]] and opponents of communism. [[Adam Michnik]] has called Kołakowski "one of the most prominent creators of contemporary Polish culture".<ref>[[Adam Michnik]] (18 July 1985) [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/5402 "Letter from the Gdansk Prison,"] ''[[New York Review of Books]]''.</ref><ref>Norman Davies (5 October 1986) [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE5DC143DF936A35753C1A960948260 "True to Himself and His Homeland,"] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> He authored more than 30 books in a career spanning more than five decades.<ref name="Kulish N.">{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/world/europe/21kolakowski.html |title=Leszek Kolakowski, Polish Philosopher, Dies at 81 |website=[[The New York Times]] |author=Nicholas Kulish |date=20 July 2009 |access-date=23 May 2023}}</ref> He is also regarded as a great populariser of philosophy. His writings, lectures and TV appearances encouraged people to ask questions, even the most banal ones, and praised the figure of a jester in philosophy – somebody who is "not afraid to challenge even our strongest assumptions and maintains a healthy distance towards everything."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://culture.pl/en/article/10-polish-philosophers-who-changed-the-way-we-think |title=10 Polish Philosophers Who Changed the Way We Think |website=culture.pl |author=Michał Wieczorek |date=1 February 2019 |access-date=22 May 2023}}</ref> 

=== Death ===
Kołakowski died from multiple organ failure on 17 July 2009, aged 81, at [[John Radcliffe Hospital]] in [[Oxford]], England.<ref>{{cite ODNB|title = Kolakowski, Leszek (1927–2009), philosopher and historian of ideas|last = Lukes|first = Steven|author-link = Steven Lukes|doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/101919|year = 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1010315/Leszek-Kolakowski|title = Leszek Kolakowski| date=19 October 2023 |publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref> In an obituary, philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] wrote that Kołakowski was a "thinker for our time" and that, regarding Kołakowski's debates with intellectual opponents, "even if ... nothing remained of the subversive orthodoxies, nobody felt damaged in their ego or defeated in their life's project, by arguments which from any other source would have inspired the greatest indignation".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|title=Leszek Kolakowski: thinker for our time|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/leszek-kolakowski-thinker-for-our-time-0/|website=opendemocracy.net|publisher=Open Democracy|access-date=27 February 2015}}</ref>
