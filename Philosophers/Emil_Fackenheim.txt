'''Emil Ludwig Fackenheim''' (22 June 1916 &ndash; 19 September 2003) was a [[Jew]]ish [[philosopher]] and Reform [[rabbi]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Joffe |first=Lawrence |date=2003-10-10 |title=Obituary, Guardian Unlimited, 10 October 2003 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher= |location= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,3604,1059938,00.html |access-date=2013-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=Wolfgang Saxon |author-link1= |title=Emil Fackenheim, 87, Scholar Of Judaism and the Holocaust |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/13/world/emil-fackenheim-87-scholar-of-judaism-and-the-holocaust.html |url-access=subscription |access-date=2 August 2021 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 October 2003 |page=B 8}}</ref>

Born in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], [[German Empire|Germany]], he was arrested by [[Nazism|Nazis]] on the night of 9 November 1938, known as {{Lang|de|[[Kristallnacht]]}}. Briefly interned at the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] (1938–1939), he escaped with his younger brother Wolfgang<ref name="gedenkbuch.halle.de">{{cite web |date=5 October 2008 |title=Unser Gedenkbuch für die Toten des Holocaust in Halle |url=http://www.gedenkbuch.halle.de/gbdatensatz.php?num=119 |access-date=2013-02-02 |website=[[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] |publisher=Gedenkbuch.halle.de |language=de}}</ref> to [[Great Britain]], where his parents later joined him. Emil's older brother Ernst-Alexander,<ref name="gedenkbuch.halle.de"/> who refused to leave Germany, was killed in [[the Holocaust]].

Held by the British as an [[enemy alien]] after the outbreak of [[World War II]], Fackenheim was sent to [[Canada]] in 1940, where he was interned at a remote internment camp near [[Sherbrooke]], [[Quebec]].<ref name="CJS">''[[Chicago Jewish Star]]'', 9 May 2008.</ref> He was freed afterward and served as the Interim Rabbi at Temple Anshe Shalom in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], from 1943 to 1948.<ref name="CJS"/> After this he enrolled in the graduate [[philosophy]] department of the [[University of Toronto]] and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the University of Toronto with a dissertation on [[Islamic philosophy|medieval Arabic philosophy]] (1945) and became [[Professor]] of Philosophy (1948–1984). He was among the original editorial advisors of the scholarly journal [[Dionysius (journal)|''Dionysius'']]. In 1971, he received an honorary doctorate from [[Sir George Williams University]], which later became [[Concordia University]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=French |first=S.G. |date=June 1971 |title=Honorary Degree Citation - Emil Fackenheim |url=http://archives.concordia.ca/fackenheim |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002074934/http://archives.concordia.ca/fackenheim |archive-date=2015-10-02 |access-date=2016-04-04 |website=Concordia University Archives}}</ref>

Fackenheim researched the relationship of the Jews with God, believing that the Holocaust must be understood as an imperative requiring Jews to carry on Jewish existence and the survival of the State of Israel. He emigrated to Israel in 1984.

"He was always saying that continuing Jewish life and denying [[Hitler]] a [[Wiktionary:posthumous|posthumous]] victory was the 614th law," referring to the [[613 mitzvot]] given to the Jews in the [[Torah]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Jewish philosopher rabbi Emil Fackenheim dies at 87 - San Francisco Chronicle, 21 September 2003 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fnews%2Farchive%2F2003%2F09%2F21%2Fobituary0856EDT0426.DTL |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031209180746/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fnews%2Farchive%2F2003%2F09%2F21%2Fobituary0856EDT0426.DTL |archive-date=9 December 2003 |access-date=2017-09-09 |website=[[SFGate]]}}</ref>

== Background==
Emil Fackenheim created this concept of the "614th commandment" (or "614th ''mitzvah''"). The "614th Commandment" can be interpreted as a moral imperative that Jews not use the facts of the Holocaust to give up on God, Judaism or—in the case of secular Jews as well—on the continuing survival of the Jewish people, thereby giving Hitler a "posthumous victory". The meaning of this imperative has been the subject of serious dialogue both within and beyond the Jewish community. Opposition to the goals of Hitler is a moral touchstone that has implications for several sensitive issues.

=== A new moral imperative ===
{{Quote box|quote=... we are, first, commanded to survive as Jews, lest the Jewish people perish. We are commanded, secondly, to remember in our very guts and bones the martyrs of the Holocaust, lest their memory perish. We are forbidden, thirdly, to deny or despair of God, however much we may have to contend with him or with belief in him, lest Judaism perish. We are forbidden, finally, to despair of the world as the place which is to become the kingdom of God, lest we help make it a meaningless place in which God is dead or irrelevant and everything is permitted. To abandon any of these imperatives, in response to Hitler's victory at [[Auschwitz]], would be to hand him yet other, posthumous victories.| source=''[[To mend the world]]'', p. 213 |width=30%| author=Emil Fackenheim}}

Traditional Jewish law contains [[613 mitzvot|613 ''mitzvot'']] (commandments) as compiled by [[Maimonides]]. These laws—365 of which are negative (e.g. "Thou shalt not...") and 248 of which are positive—cover all aspects of life. Fackenheim asserted that tradition could not anticipate the Holocaust, so one more law, a 614th Commandment, became necessary. "Thou shalt not hand Hitler posthumous victories. To despair of the [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]] is to continue Hitler's work for him."<ref>{{cite web |last=Silverman |first=Reuven |date=29 January 2005 |title=A-Z of Jewish Values: C for Commandments |url=http://www.mcr-reform.org.uk/A-Z%20sermons/C%20for%20Commandments.htm |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708173951/http://www.mcr-reform.org.uk/A-Z%20sermons/C%20for%20Commandments.htm |archive-date=July 8, 2007 |access-date=2006-02-09 |website=[[Manchester Reform Synagogue]]}}</ref> This proposes that people of Jewish heritage have a moral obligation to observe their faith and thus frustrate Hitler's goal of eliminating Judaism from the earth.

Fackenheim came to this conclusion slowly. A professor of philosophy at the [[University of Toronto]] and a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] rabbi, he did not become a [[Zionist]] until 1967, when his reaction to the Holocaust and its implications for Jewish law crystallized:

{{Blockquote|It was at a meeting, just before the [[Six-Day War]]. It was a meeting in [[New York City|New York]], and I had to make a speech. Before that, the Holocaust had never been essential to my ideology. However, when the chairman said, 'You've got to face it,' I had to face it. I said the most important thing I ever said.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020|reason=Article unavailable at site}}}}


=== Implications ===

==== Zionism ====
Fackenheim applied this reasoning to the state of Israel and its [[Law of Return]] as a necessity to prevent a second Holocaust. Had a Jewish state existed in the 1930s, it could have accepted Jewish refugees and rescued large numbers of people.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fackenheim |first=Emil L. |date=April 2002 |title=Faith in God and Man After Auschwitz: Theological Implications |url=https://www.holocaust-trc.org/faith-in-god-and-man-after-auschwitz-theological-implications/ |access-date=2013-02-02 |website=Holocaust Teacher Resource Center |publisher=}}</ref> This opinion carries clout with most Jewish people although the specifics of how to apply it in contemporary politics is a subject of debate. Boris Shusteff invokes it in a conservative opposition to Israeli withdrawal from settlements.<ref>{{cite web |last=Shusteff |first=Boris |date=15 August 2005 |title=The 614th Commandment |url=http://www.gamla.org.il/english/article/2005/aug/b1.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225143643/http://www.gamla.org.il/english/article/2005/aug/b1.htm |archive-date=February 25, 2006 |access-date=2006-02-09 |website=GAMLA: News & Views from Israel}}</ref>

Despite the explicit connection to Zionism, few sources mention Hitler and posthumous victories in reference to [[Islam]]. [[Palestinian Christians|Christian Palestinian]] [[Sami Aldeeb]] of the [[Swiss Institute of Comparative Law]] in Lausanne paraphrases it ironically in a defense of Palestinian interests.<ref>{{cite web |last=Aldeeb |first=Sami |author-link=Sami Aldeeb |title=No justice, no peace for a Canaanite republic |url=http://www.lpj.org/Nonviolence/Sami/articles/eng-articles/canaanite.htm |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020308115148/http://www.lpj.org/Nonviolence/Sami/articles/eng-articles/canaanite.htm |archive-date=8 March 2002 |access-date=2006-02-09 |website=[[Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem]]}}</ref> Where a form of it appears in the ''[[Asia Times]]'' as part of a quote from [[Robert Novak]], the cultural resonance appears to go unnoticed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Spengler |date=2004-11-23 |title=Muslim anguish and Western hypocrisy |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/FK23Aa01.html |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041123174415/http://atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/FK23Aa01.html |archive-date=2004-11-23 |access-date=2013-02-02 |website=[[Asia Times]] |publisher=}}</ref>

==== Holocaust remembrance ====
The concept encounters broad acceptance in connection with Holocaust remembrance. In the late twentieth century, efforts to document the memories of remaining Holocaust survivors echoed the notion that preserving these facts for future generations was a way to keep Hitler and his ideas in the grave. A guide for [[United Kingdom|British]] primary school teachers gives the concept in a guide for informing children about the Holocaust.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.farmington.ac.uk/documents/new_reports/TT77.htm |title=Teaching about the Holocaust in primary schools – The Farmington Institute |access-date=2006-02-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040113055041/http://www.farmington.ac.uk/documents/new_reports/TT77.htm |archive-date=January 13, 2004 }}</ref> Richard A. Cohen of the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] cites it in an essay, "The Holocaust is a Christian Issue."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghansel.free.fr/holocauste.html |title=The Holocaust is a Christian Issue |publisher=Ghansel.free.fr |access-date=2013-02-02}}</ref>

==== Caution against antisemitism ====
The phrase finds resonance within Christian communities as a rebuke against antisemitism. [[Methodist]] minister Rev. Robert A. Hill quotes Fackenheim in a sermon with this context:

<blockquote>...the fact is that Christianity has been pervasively guilty of latent and patent anti-Semitism and the Gospel of John has been one of its sources. We have and can learn from this failure, by carefully monitoring our use of religious language...and our Jewish brothers and sisters can teach us to continue, with Jacob, to wrestle with God.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asburyfirstumc.org/sermons/2004/041017rah.html |title=Asbury First United Methodist Church |access-date=2006-02-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050503013427/http://www.asburyfirstumc.org/sermons/2004/041017rah.html |archive-date=May 3, 2005 }}</ref></blockquote>

==== Conversion to other religions ====
Within the broader context of religious tolerance, this concept applies to the sensitive subjects of conversion and intermarriage. [[Gregory Baum]], a German-born [[Catholic]] theologian and Professor Emeritus in Religious Studies at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], expresses the effect of this concept on [[Christianity|Christian]] views toward conversion. From the perspective of most Christian faiths, whose doctrines normally advocate conversion of nonbelievers, this represents a deep respect for Fackenheim's concept:

<blockquote>After Auschwitz the Christian churches no longer wish to convert the Jews. While they may not be sure of the theological grounds that dispense them from this mission, the churches have become aware that asking the Jews to become Christians is a spiritual way of blotting them out of existence and thus only reinforces the effects of the Holocaust.<ref>''Auschwitz: Beginning of a New Era?'' p. 113.</ref></blockquote>

Fackenheim's affirmation of his Jewish heritage, although embraced by many other Holocaust survivors, was by no means universal. Physicist [[Lise Meitner]] had been born and brought up Jewish. She rejected newspaper attempts to characterize her as a Jew following the bombing of [[Hiroshima]] when the press learned that she had been the first scientist to recognize [[nuclear fission]]. Decades before Hitler rose to power she had become a [[Lutheran]]. Although the Nazis stole her savings and ruined her career she refused to work on the bomb or let Hitler define her identity.<ref>''Lise Meitner: A Life in Science''</ref>

=== Criticism ===
Rabbi [[Toba Spitzer]] finds this idea compelling yet incomplete. In a [[Passover]] essay for SocialAction.com she addresses it sympathetically before embracing the Passover tradition and its [[Passover Seder|Seder]] ritual as a more meaningful story:

<blockquote>...of a people born in slavery, freed by their God, and taken on a transformational journey. It is the story of the steps taken towards becoming a community bound by a holy covenant, where social relationships are defined by the Godly principles of ''tzedek'' and ''chesed'', justice and love.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.socialaction.com/03-2004/torah-passover-2004.phtml |title=Torah Teaching – For the week ending April 9, 2004 |access-date=2006-02-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040602114036/http://www.socialaction.com/03-2004/torah-passover-2004.phtml |archive-date=June 2, 2004 }}</ref>
</blockquote>

Rabbi Marc Gellman rejects it outright in a 2005 ''[[Newsweek]]'' column:

<blockquote>I am Jewish because my mother is Jewish, and, more importantly, because I believe Judaism is loving, just, joyous, hopeful and true. I am not Jewish, and I did not teach my children or my students to be Jewish, just to spite Hitler.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marc Gellman |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/51690 |title=Spiritual State: Inhumanity to Jews |work=Newsweek |date=2005-05-10 |access-date=2013-02-02}}</ref>
</blockquote>

The same criticism was formulated by Jewish philosopher [[Michael Wyschogrod]] in his 1971 review of ''God's Presence in History''. Wyschogrod questioned the value of a definition of Judaism that merely inverts antisemitism into a bigoted "semitism." The uniqueness of Auschwitz as a historical event, moreover, is a dubious distinction. "It is necessary to recognize that, from any universally humanistic framework, the destruction of European Jewry is one notable chapter in the long record of man's inhumanity against man."<ref name="Wyschogrod">Michael Wyschogrod, "Faith and the Holocaust: A Review Essay of Emil Fackenheim's ''God's Presence in History''," Judaism 20 (1970–71). p. 292.</ref>{{rp|292}} Not satisfied with criticism, however, Wyschogrod offered a traditional explanation of the Jewish claim to uniqueness and [[Jews as the chosen people|chosenness]] formulated in positive terms.

<blockquote>The fate of Israel is of central concern because Israel is the elect people of God through whom God's redemptive work is done in the world. However tragic human suffering is on the human plane, what happens to Israel is directly tied to its role as that nation to which God attaches His name and through which He will redeem man. He who strikes Israel, therefore, engages himself in battle with God and it is for this reason that the history of Israel is the fulcrum of human history. The suffering of others must, therefore, be seen in the light of Israel's suffering. The travail of man is not abandoned, precisely because Israel suffers and, thereby, God's presence is drawn into human history and redemption enters the horizon of human existence.<ref name="Wyschogrod" />{{rp|293}}</blockquote>

Focusing not on Fackenheim's conception of Jewish identity but on Zionism, renowned scholar Daniel Shoag presents a critique of this view from within the Jewish community in ''The Harvard Israel Review'':

<blockquote>While Fackenheim's sentiments about the need for Jewish self-reliance in the form of a Jewish state are immensely popular, Fackenheim fails to locate a religious or divine source for his moral imperative. For Fackenheim, self-defense, and its manifestation in Zionism, are not religious values but rather things that precede religious value or stand outside of it. Thus Fackenheim locates the significance of the Jewish State in the Holocaust rather than in traditional Judaism...<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hcs.harvard.edu/~hireview/content.php?type=article&issue=spring04/&name=shoag |title=Harvard Israel Review (HIR) |publisher=Hcs.harvard.edu |access-date=2013-02-02}}</ref>
</blockquote>
Perhaps the strongest rejection of Fackenheim's idea of the 614th commandment comes from Rabbi Harold M. Schulweiss:

<blockquote>We abuse the Holocaust when it becomes a cudgel against others who have their claims of suffering. The [[Shoah]] must not be misused in the contest of one-downsmanship with other victims of brutality. ... The Shoah has become our instant ''raison d'etre'', the short-cut answer to the penetrating questions of our children: 'Why should I not marry out of the faith? Why should I join a synagogue? Why should I support Israel? Why should I be Jewish?' We have relied on a singular imperative: 'Thou shalt not give Hitler a posthumous victory.' That answer will not work. To live in spite, to say 'no' to Hitler is a far cry from living 'yes' to Judaism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishpublicaffairs.org/publications/schulweiss.html |title=With What Shall We Enter the New Century? |access-date=2006-02-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011227180219/http://www.jewishpublicaffairs.org/publications/schulweiss.html |archive-date=December 27, 2001 }}</ref>
</blockquote>

Rabbi Michael Goldberg has developed this sort of criticism in his book ''Why Should the Jews Survive?: Looking Past the Holocaust Toward a Jewish Future.''

=== Conclusion ===
During Fackenheim's last interview in 2000 he confronted the question, "Do you think Israel can ever come to the point where it doesn't have to be in a state of resistance?"

<blockquote>I think it will be a very long time. But I would say this. Will the time ever come when we can say Hitler's shadow is gone? I think, yes, it will come when Israel is accepted in peace with its neighbor states. But it doesn't look like it will happen soon.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020|reason=Article unavailable at site}}
