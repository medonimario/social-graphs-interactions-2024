'''Amartya Kumar Sen''' {{post-nominals|country=IND|BR}} ({{IPA|bn|ˈɔmortːo ˈʃen}}; born 3 November 1933) is an Indian economist and philosopher. Sen has taught and worked in England and the United States since 1972. In 1998, Sen received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] for his contributions to [[welfare economics]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1998/summary/ |access-date=20 May 2024 |website=NobelPrize.org |language=en-US}}</ref> He has also made major scholarly contributions to [[social choice theory]], [[Economic justice|economic]] and [[social justice]], economic theories of [[famine]]s, [[decision theory]], [[development economics]], [[public health]], and the measures of [[well-being]] of countries.

Sen is currently the [[Harvard University Professor|Thomas W. Lamont University Professor]], and Professor of Economics and Philosophy at [[Harvard University]].<ref name="Sen Harvard DP">{{cite web|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/sen/biocv|title=University Professorships |publisher=[[Harvard University]]|access-date=31 October 2019}}</ref> He previously served as Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name="Trinity Cambridge">{{cite web|title=The Master of Trinity|url=https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/master-fellows/master/|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|access-date=27 December 2020|archive-date=27 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227055042/https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/master-fellows/master/|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1999, he received India's highest civilian honour, [[Bharat Ratna]], for his contribution to welfare economics. The German Publishers and Booksellers Association awarded him the 2020 [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]] for his pioneering scholarship addressing issues of global justice and combating social inequality in education and healthcare.

His father, Ashutosh Sen, was a Professor of Chemistry at [[Dhaka University]], then the Development Commissioner in Delhi and then Chairman of the West Bengal Public Service Commission. Sen moved with his family to [[West Bengal]] in 1945. Sen's mother, Amita Sen, was the daughter of [[Kshitimohan Sen|Kshiti Mohan Sen]], the eminent Sanskritist and scholar of ancient and medieval India. Sen's maternal grandfather was a close associate of Tagore. K. M. Sen served as the second [[Vice-Chancellor]] of [[Visva-Bharati University|Visva Bharati University]] from 1953 to 1954.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Former Vice-Chancellors of Visva Bharati University |url=https://visvabharati.ac.in/FormerViceChancellors.html |access-date=20 May 2024 |website=visvabharati.ac.in}}</ref>

Sen began his school education at [[St Gregory's School (Dhaka)|St Gregory's School]] in [[Dhaka]] in 1940. In the fall of 1941, he was admitted to [[Patha Bhavana]], Santiniketan, where he completed his school education. The school had many progressive features, such as distaste for examinations or competitive testing. In addition, the school stressed cultural diversity, and embraced cultural influences from the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html|title=Amartya Sen – Biographical |publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=25 April 2016}}</ref> In 1951, he went to [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College, Calcutta]], where he earned a BA in economics with First in the First Class, with a minor in Mathematics, as a graduating student of the [[University of Calcutta]]. While at Presidency, Sen was diagnosed with oral cancer, and given a 15 per cent chance of living five years.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Riz Khan interviewing Amartya Sen |date=21 August 2010 |title=One on One Amartya Sen |medium=Television production |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN5esbvAt-w |access-date=26 April 2016 |time=18:40 minutes in |publisher=Al Jazeera }}</ref> With radiation treatment, he survived, and in 1953 he moved to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he earned a second BA in economics in 1955 with a first class, topping the list as well. At this time, he was elected President of the Cambridge [[Majlis]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=fionaholland |date=11 October 2021 |title=At home with Professor Amartya Sen |url=https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/news/at-home-with-professor-amartya-sen/ |access-date=18 May 2023 |website=Trinity College Cambridge |language=en-GB}}</ref> While Sen was officially a PhD student at Cambridge (though he had finished his research in 1955–56), he was offered the position of First-Professor and First-Head of the Economics Department of the newly created [[Jadavpur University]] in [[Calcutta]]. Appointed to the position at age 22, he is still the youngest chairman to have headed the Department of Economics. He served in that position, starting the new Economics Department, from 1956 to 1958.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Amartya |title=Home in the World |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2021 |isbn=978-0-141-97098-1 |pages=328–335}}</ref>

Meanwhile, Sen was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College, which gave him four years to study any subject; he made the decision to study [[philosophy]]. Sen explained: "The broadening of my studies into philosophy was important for me not just because some of my main areas of interest in economics relate quite closely to philosophical disciplines (for example, [[social choice theory]] makes intense use of [[mathematical logic]] and also draws on [[moral philosophy]], and so does the study of inequality and deprivation), but also because I found philosophical studies very rewarding on their own."<ref name=Philosophy>{{cite web|title=Amartya Sen – Biographical: Philosophy and economics |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website= The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher= Nobel Prize |access-date= 16 June 2014 }}</ref> His interest in philosophy, however, dates back to his college days at Presidency, where he read books on philosophy and debated philosophical themes. One of the books he was most interested in was [[Kenneth Arrow]]'s ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html|title=Amartya Sen – Biographical|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=20 November 2017}}</ref>

In Cambridge, there were major debates between supporters of [[Keynesian economics]], and the neo-classical economists who were sceptical of Keynes. Because of a lack of enthusiasm for social choice theory in both Trinity and Cambridge, Sen chose a different subject for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] thesis, which was on "[[Choice of techniques|The Choice of Techniques]]" in 1959. The work had been completed earlier, except for advice from his adjunct supervisor in India, [[A.&nbsp;K. Dasgupta]], given to Sen while teaching and revising his work at Jadavpur, under the supervision of the "brilliant but vigorously intolerant" [[post-Keynesian]] [[Joan Robinson]].<ref name=Robinson>{{cite web|title= Amartya Sen – Biographical: Cambridge as a battleground |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website= The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher= Nobel Prize |access-date= 16 June 2014 }}</ref> [[Quentin Skinner]] notes that Sen was a member of the secret society [[Cambridge Apostles]] during his time at Cambridge.<ref>{{cite AV media | people = Professor Quentin Skinner and Alan Macfarlane | title = Interview of Professor Quentin Skinner &nbsp;– part 2 | medium = Video | via = YouTube | location = Cambridge | date = 2 June 2008 | minutes = 57:55 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVdAhzqFLps }}</ref>

During 1960–61, Amartya Sen visited the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], on leave from Trinity College.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Amartya |title=Home in the World |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2021 |isbn=978-0-141-97098-1 |pages=358–364}}</ref>

=== Social Choice Theory ===
Sen's work on 'Choice of Techniques' complemented that of [[Maurice Dobb]]. In a developing country, the Dobb-Sen strategy relied on maximising investible surpluses, maintaining constant real wages and using the entire increase in labour productivity, due to technological change, to raise the rate of accumulation. In other words, workers were expected to demand no improvement in their standard of living despite having become more productive.
Sen's papers in the late 1960s and early 1970s helped develop the theory of [[social choice]], which first came to prominence in the work by the American economist [[Kenneth Arrow]]. Arrow had most famously shown that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), any [[Ranked voting system|ranked order]] [[voting system]] will in at least some situations inevitably conflict with what many assume to be basic democratic norms. Sen's contribution to the literature was to show under what conditions [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Benicourt | first = Emmanuelle | title = Is Amartya Sen a post-autistic economist? | journal = Post-Autistic Economics Review | issue = 15 | pages = article 4 | date = 1 September 2002 | url = http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue15/Benicourt15.htm | access-date= 16 June 2014}}</ref> applied, as well as to extend and enrich the theory of social choice, informed by his interests in [[history of economic thought]] and philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

=== Poverty and Famines ===
In 1981, Sen published ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' (1981), a book in which he argued that famine occurs not only from a lack of food, but from inequalities built into mechanisms for distributing food. Sen also argued that the Bengal famine was caused by an urban economic boom that raised [[food prices]], thereby causing millions of rural workers to starve to death when their wages did not keep up.<ref name=Time>{{cite magazine | last= Sachs | first= Jeffrey | author-link = Jeffrey Sachs | title= The real causes of famine: a Nobel laureate blames authoritarian rulers | url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989405,00.html | access-date= 16 June 2014 | magazine= Time | date= 26 October 1998 }}</ref> In 1999 he wrote, "no famine has ever taken place ... in a functioning democracy".<ref>Sen (1999, p. 16).  Similarly, on p. 176, he wrote, "there has never been a famine in a functioning multiparty democracy."</ref>

In addition to his important work on the causes of famines, Sen's work in the field of development economics has had considerable influence in the formulation of the "[[Human Development Report]]",<ref name=UNDP>{{cite book | contribution = Overview &#124; Celebrating 20 years of human development | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme | title = Human Development Report 2010 &#124; 20th anniversary edition &#124; the real wealth of nations: pathways to human development | page = 2 | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = New York| year = 2010 | isbn = 9780230284456 | quote = ...the first HDR called for a different approach to economics and development – one that put people at the centre.

=== "Equality of What?" (1979) ===
Sen's revolutionary contribution to development economics and social indicators is the concept of "[[Capability approach|capability]]" developed in his article "Equality of What?".<ref name="What">{{Cite web |last=Sen |first=Amartya |date=22 May 1979 |title="Equality of What?" |url=https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/s/sen80.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210619215632/https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/s/sen80.pdf |archive-date=19 June 2021 |website=Tanner Lectures - The University of Utah}}</ref> He argues that governments should be measured against the concrete capabilities of their citizens. This is because top-down development will always trump [[human rights]] as long as the definition of terms remains in doubt (is a "right" something that must be provided or something that simply cannot be taken away?). For instance, in the United States citizens have a right to vote. To Sen, this concept is fairly empty. In order for citizens to have a capacity to vote, they first must have "functionings". These "functionings" can range from the very broad, such as the availability of education, to the very specific, such as transportation to the [[Polling station|polls]]. Only when such barriers are removed can the citizen truly be said to act out of personal choice. It is up to the individual society to make the list of minimum capabilities guaranteed by that society. For an example of the "capabilities approach" in practice, see [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s ''Women and Human Development''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = Women and human development: the capabilities approach | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780521003858 }}</ref>

=== "More than 100 Million Women Are Missing" (1990) ===
He wrote a controversial article in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' entitled "More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing" (see [[Missing women of Asia]]), analysing the mortality impact of unequal rights between the genders in the developing world, particularly Asia.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sen |first=Amartya |date=20 December 1990 |title=More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1990/12/20/more-than-100-million-women-are-missing/ |access-date=29 May 2024 |work=The New York Review of Books |language=en |volume=37 |issue=20 |issn=0028-7504}}</ref> Other studies, including one by [[Emily Oster]], had argued that this is an overestimation, though Oster has since then recanted her conclusions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Oster | first1 = Emily |last2 = Chen | first2 = Gang | author-link1 = Emily Oster |title=Hepatitis B does not explain male-biased sex ratios in China |journal=[[Economics Letters]] |volume=107 |issue=2 |year=2010 |pages=142–144 |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2010.01.007 | s2cid = 9071877 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w13971.pdf }}</ref>

=== ''Development as Freedom'' (1999) ===
In 1999, Sen further advanced and redefined the capability approach in his book ''[[Development as Freedom]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Amartya |url=https://archive.org/details/developmentasfre00amar |title=Development as Freedom |publisher=Anchor |year=1999 |isbn=978-0385720274}}</ref> Sen argued that development should be viewed as an effort to advance the real freedoms that individuals enjoy, rather than simply focusing on metrics such as GDP or income-per-capita. 

Sen was inspired by violent acts he had witnessed as a child leading up to the Partition of India in 1947. On one morning, a Muslim daily labourer named Kader Mia stumbled through the rear gate of Sen's family home, bleeding from a knife wound in his back. Because of his extreme poverty, he had come to Sen's primarily Hindu neighbourhood searching for work; his choices were the starvation of his family or the risk of death in coming to the neighbourhood. The price of Kader Mia's economic unfreedom was his death. Kader Mia need not have come to a hostile area in search of income in those troubled times if his family could have managed without it. This experience led Sen to begin thinking about economic unfreedom from a young age.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Amartya |title=Development As Freedom |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2011 |isbn=9780307874290 |pages=8}}</ref>

In ''Development as Freedom'', Sen outlined five specific types of freedoms: political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security. Political freedoms refer to the ability of the people to have a voice in government and to be able to scrutinise the authorities. Economic facilities concern both the resources within the market and the market mechanism itself. Any focus on income and wealth in the country would serve to increase the economic facilities for the people. Social opportunities deal with the establishments that provide benefits like healthcare or education for the populace, allowing individuals to live better lives. Transparency guarantees allow individuals to interact with some degree of trust and knowledge of the interaction. Protective security is the system of social safety nets that prevent a group affected by poverty being subjected to terrible misery. Development encompassing non-economic areas, Sen argues, renders the notion of a dichotomy between "freedom" and "development," as implied by the concept of [[Asian values]], meaningless and disingenuous.

Before Sen's work, these had been viewed as only the ends of development; luxuries afforded to countries that focus on increasing income. However, Sen argued that the increase in real freedoms should be both the ends and the means of development. He elaborates upon this by illustrating the closely interconnected natures of the five main freedoms as he believes that expansion of one of those freedoms can lead to expansion in another one as well. In this regard, he discussed the correlation between social opportunities of education and health and how both of these complement economic and political freedoms as a healthy and well-educated person is better suited to make informed economic decisions and be involved in fruitful political demonstrations, etc. A comparison is also drawn between China and India to illustrate this interdependence of freedoms.

=== ''The Idea of Justice'' (2009) ===
In 2009, Sen published a book called ''[[The Idea of Justice]]''.<ref name="Sen 2010" /> Based on his previous work in welfare economics and social choice theory, but also on his philosophical thoughts, Sen presented his own theory of justice that he meant to be an alternative to the influential modern theories of justice of [[John Rawls]] or [[John Harsanyi]]. In opposition to Rawls but also earlier justice theoreticians [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] or [[David Hume]], and inspired by the philosophical works of [[Adam Smith]] and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], Sen developed a theory that is both comparative and realisations-oriented (instead of being transcendental and institutional). However, he still regards institutions and processes as being equally important. As an alternative to Rawls's [[veil of ignorance]], Sen chose the [[thought experiment]] of an impartial spectator as the basis of his theory of justice. He also stressed the importance of public discussion (understanding democracy in the sense of [[John Stuart Mill]]) and a focus on people's capabilities (an [[capability approach|approach]] that he had co-developed), including the notion of universal human rights, in evaluating various states with regard to justice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

In August 2019, during the clampdown and curfew in [[Kashmir]] for more than two weeks after the [[Indian revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status]], Sen criticised the government and said "As an Indian, I am not proud of the fact that India, after having done so much to achieve a democratic norm in the world – where India was the first non-Western country to go for democracy – that we lose that reputation on the grounds of action that have been taken".<ref>[https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/amartya-sen-no-resolution-of-kashmir-without-democracy-2087327 "Not Proud As An Indian...": Amartya Sen's Critique Of Kashmir Move], NDTV, 19 August 2019.</ref><ref>[http://m.thedailynewnation.com/news/226084/kashmir-without-democracy-not-acceptable-amartya Kashmir without democracy not acceptable: Amartya] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200920110433/http://m.thedailynewnation.com/news/226084/kashmir-without-democracy-not-acceptable-amartya |date=20 September 2020}}, ''New Nation'', 19 August 2019.</ref> He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as "a classical colonial excuse" to prevent [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|backlash]] against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.<ref>[https://www.ndtv.com/video/shows/left-right-centre/j-k-detentions-a-classic-colonial-excuse-amartya-sen-524819 J&K Detentions "A Classic Colonial Excuse": Amartya Sen], NDTV, 19 August 2019.</ref>

Sen has spent much of his later life as a political writer and activist. He has been outspoken about Narendra Modi's leadership in India. In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', he claimed that Modi's fearmongering among the Indian people was anti-democratic. "The big thing that we know from John Stuart Mill is that democracy is government by discussion, and, if you make discussion fearful, you are not going to get a democracy, no matter how you count the votes." He disagreed with Modi's ideology of Hindu nationalism, and advocated for a more integrated and diverse ideology that reflects the heterogeneity of India.<ref>Chotiner, Isaac, and Eliza Griswold.

Sen also wrote an article for ''The New York Times'' in 2013 documenting the reasons why India trailed behind China in economic development. He advocated for healthcare reform, because low-income people in India have to deal with exploitative and inadequate private healthcare. He recommended that India implement the same education policies that Japan did in the late 19th century. However, he conceded that there is a tradeoff between democracy and progress in Asia because democracy is a near reality in India and not in China.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/opinion/why-india-trails-china.html "Why India Trails China."] ''New York Times'', 20 June 2013.</ref>

In a 1999 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Sen recommended for India a middle path between the "hard-knocks" development policy that creates wealth at the expense of civil liberties, and radical progressivism that only seeks to protect civil liberties at the expense of development. Rather than create an entirely new theory for ethical development in Asia, Sen sought to reform the current development model.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Kapur |first=Akash |date=December 1999 |title=A Third Way for the Third World |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/12/a-third-way-for-the-third-world/377927/ |magazine=The Atlantic Monthly |pages=124–129}}</ref>
