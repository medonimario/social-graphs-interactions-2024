'''Celsus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|s|ə|s}}; {{langx|grc-x-hellen|Κέλσος}}, ''Kélsos''; {{Floruit|AD 175–177}}) was a 2nd-century [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] and [[Criticism of Christianity|opponent]] of [[early Christianity]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Young |first=Frances M. |author-link=Frances Young |year=2006 |chapter=Monotheism and Christology |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UTfmw_zStsC&pg=PA452 |editor1-last=Mitchell |editor1-first=Margaret M. |editor1-link=Margaret M.

== Philosophy ==
All that is known about Celsus himself comes from the surviving text of his book and from what Origen says about him.{{sfn|Wilken|2003|page=94}} Although Origen initially refers to Celsus as an [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]],{{sfn|Thomas|2004|page=72}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=215}}{{sfn|Wilken|2003|pages=94–95}} his arguments reflect ideas of the [[Platonism|Platonic]] tradition, rather than Epicureanism.{{sfn|Thomas|2004|page=72}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=215–216}}{{sfn|Wilken|2003|pages=94–95}} Origen attributes this to Celsus's inconsistency,{{sfn|Thomas|2004|page=72}} but modern historians see it instead as evidence that Celsus was not an Epicurean at all.{{sfn|Thomas|2004|page=72}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=215}} Joseph Wilson Trigg states that Origen probably confused Celsus, the author of ''The True Word'', with a different Celsus, who was an Epicurean philosopher and a friend of the Syrian satirist [[Lucian]].{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=215}} Celsus the Epicurean must have lived around the same time as the author of ''The True Word'' and he is mentioned by Lucian in his treatise ''On Magic''.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=215}} Both Celsus the friend of Lucian and Celsus the author of ''The True Word'' evidently shared a passionate zeal against ''[[superstitio]]'', making it easy to see how Origen could have concluded that they were the same person.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=215}}

Stephen Thomas states that Celsus may not have been a Platonist ''per se'',{{sfn|Thomas|2004|page=72}} but that he was clearly familiar with [[Plato]].{{sfn|Thomas|2004|page=72}} Celsus's actual philosophy appears to be a blend of elements derived from Platonism, [[Aristotelianism]], [[Pythagoreanism]], and [[Stoicism]].{{sfn|Thomas|2004|page=72}} Wilken likewise concludes that Celsus was a philosophical eclectic, whose views reflect a variety of ideas popular to a number of different schools.{{sfn|Wilken|2003|page=95}} Wilken classifies Celsus as "a conservative intellectual", noting that "he supports traditional values and defends accepted beliefs".{{sfn|Wilken|2003|page=95}} Theologian [[Robert M. Grant (theologian)|Robert M. Grant]] notes that Origen and Celsus actually agree on many points:{{sfn|Grant|1967|page=552}} "Both are opposed to [[Anthropotheism|anthropomorphism]], to [[idolatry]], and to any crudely literal theology."{{sfn|Grant|1967|page=552}} Celsus also writes as a loyal citizen of the [[Roman Empire]] and a devoted believer in the [[ancient Greek religion]] and the [[religion in ancient Rome]], distrustful of Christianity as new and foreign.{{sfn|Gregerman|2016|page=61}}

Thomas remarks that Celsus "is no genius as a philosopher".{{sfn|Thomas|2004|page=72}} Nonetheless, most scholars, including Thomas, agree that Origen's quotations from ''The True Word'' reveal that the work was well-researched.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=33}}{{sfn|Thomas|2004|pages=72–73}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=215–216}}{{sfn|Gregerman|2016|page=61}} Celsus demonstrates extensive knowledge of both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s{{sfn|Thomas|2004|page=72}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=215–216}}{{sfn|Gregerman|2016|page=61}} and of both Jewish and Christian history.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=215–216}}{{sfn|Gregerman|2016|page=61}} Celsus was also closely familiar with the literary features of ancient polemics.{{sfn|Gregerman|2016|page=61}} Celsus seems to have read at least one work by one of the second-century Christian apologists, possibly [[Justin Martyr]] or [[Aristides of Athens]].{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=216}}{{sfn|Wilken|2003|page=101}} From this reading, Celsus seems to have known which kinds of arguments Christians would be most vulnerable to.{{sfn|Wilken|2003|page=101}} He also mentions the [[Ophites]] and [[Simonians]], two Gnostic sects that had almost completely vanished by Origen's time.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=216}} One of Celsus's main sources for Books I–II of ''The True Word'' was an earlier anti-Christian polemic written by an unknown Jewish author,{{sfn|Gregerman|2016|page=61}}{{sfn|Thomas|2004|page=72}} whom Origen refers to as the "Jew of Celsus".{{sfn|Thomas|2004|page=72}} This Jewish source also provides well-researched criticism of Christianity{{sfn|Gregerman|2016|page=61}} and, although Celsus was also hostile to Judaism,{{sfn|Gregerman|2016|page=61}} he occasionally relies on this Jewish author's arguments,{{sfn|Gregerman|2016|page=61}} if only to demonstrate the inconsistency of the Christian position, rather than argue for his own.

==Work==
{{main|The True Word}}
Celsus was the author of a work titled ''The True Word'' (''Logos Alēthēs''). The argument was contested by the contemporary Christian community and the book was eventually banned in 448 AD by order of [[Valentinian III]] and [[Theodosius II]], along with [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s 15 books attacking the Christians, ''The Philosophy from Oracles''. No complete copies are extant,<ref name="Hoffmann p.29"/><ref name=doc>{{cite book|author=Ulrich R.

Celsus seems to have been interested in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]],<ref>Chadwick, H., ''Origen: Contra Celsum''. CUP (1965), 3, 17, 19; 8, 58.  He quotes an Egyptian musician named Dionysius in ''CC'' 6, 41.</ref> and he seemed to know of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jewish]] logos-theology, both of which suggest ''The True Doctrine'' was composed in Alexandria.<ref>Chadwick, H., ''Origen: Contra Celsum'', CUP (1965), p. xxviii-xxix</ref> Origen indicates that Celsus was an [[Epicurean]] living under the Emperor [[Hadrian]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=290&letter=C |title=Celsus |first1=Richard |last1=Gottheil |first2= Samuel |last2=Krauss | access-date=2007-05-18 |encyclopedia=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] }}</ref><ref>Chadwick, H. ''Origen: Contra Celsum'', introduction.</ref>

Celsus writes that "there is an ancient doctrine [''archaios logos''] which has existed from the beginning, which has always been maintained by the wisest nations and cities and wise men". He leaves Jews and Moses out of those he cites (Egyptians, Syrians,
Indians, Persians, Odrysians, Samothracians, Eleusinians, Hyperboreans, Galactophagoi, Druids, and Getae), and instead blames Moses for the corruption of the ancient religion. "The goatherds and shepherds who followed Moses as their leader were deluded by clumsy deceits into thinking that there was only one God, [and] without any rational cause ... these goatherds and shepherds abandoned the worship of many gods". However, Celsus's harshest criticism was reserved for Christians, who "wall themselves off and break away from the rest of mankind".<ref name=Ha/>

Celsus initiated a critical attack on Christianity, ridiculing many of its dogmas. He wrote that some Jews said Jesus's father was actually a Roman soldier named Pantera. Origen considered this a fabricated story.<ref>''Contra Celsum'' by Origen, Henry Chadwick, 1980, {{ISBN|0-521-29576-9}}, page 32</ref><ref>Patrick, John, ''The Apology of Origen in Reply to Celsus'', 2009, {{ISBN|1-110-13388-X}}, pages 22–24,</ref> In addition, Celsus addressed the [[miracles of Jesus]], holding that "Jesus performed his miracles by sorcery ([[wikt:γοητεία|γοητεία]])":<ref>{{cite book|title=The Miracles of Jesus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qp43AAAAIAAJ&q=according+to+Celsus+Jesus+performed+His+miracles+by+sorcery&pg=PA166|access-date=14 June 2012|year=1965|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|author=Hendrik van der Loos|quote=According to Celsus Jesus performed His miracles by sorcery (γοητεία); ditto in II, 14; II, 16; II, 44; II, 48; II, 49 (Celsus puts Jesus' miraculous signs on a par with those among men).}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Early Christian Women and Pagan Opinion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bpj0g2OJRYcC&q=Celsus+miracles+of+Jesus+sorcery&pg=PA106|access-date=14 June 2012|date=3 October 1996|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|author=Margaret Y.

Origen wrote his refutation in 248. Sometimes quoting, sometimes paraphrasing, sometimes merely referring, Origen reproduces and replies to Celsus's arguments. Since accuracy was essential to his refutation of ''The True Doctrine'',<ref name="James D. Tabor 2006. p 64">James D. Tabor, ''The Jesus Dynasty: The Hidden History of Jesus, His Royal Family, and the Birth of Christianity'', Simon and Schuster, 2006. p 64</ref> most scholars agree that Origen is a reliable source for what Celsus wrote.<ref>David Brewster  & Richard R. Yeo, ''The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia'', Volume 8, Routledge, 1999.  p 362</ref><ref>[[Bernhard Lang (biblical scholar)|Bernhard Lang]], ''[[International Review of Biblical Studies]]'', Volume 54, Publisher [[Brill Publishers|BRILL]], 2009. p. 401</ref>

Biblical scholar Arthur J. Droge has written that it is incorrect to refer to Celsus's perspective as [[polytheism]]. Instead, he was a [[Henotheism|henotheist]], as opposed to the Jewish strict [[monotheism]];<ref name=Ha/>  historian Wouter Hanegraaff explains that "the former has room for a hierarchy of lower deities which do not detract from the ultimate unity of the One."<ref>Hanegraaff p. 38</ref> Celsus shows himself familiar with the story of Jewish origins.<ref>{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Dale B. |title=Inventing Superstition: From the Hippocratics to the Christians |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2004 |isbn=0-674-01534-7 |pages=141, 143}}</ref>{{clarify|date=February 2018}} Conceding that Christians are not without success in business (''infructuosi in negotiis''), Celsus wants them to be good citizens, to retain their own belief but worship the emperors and join their fellow citizens in defending the empire.<ref>Terrot Reavely Glover, ''The Conflict Of Religions In The Early Roman Empire'', (Methuen & Co., 1910 [Kindle Edition]), chap. VIII., p. 431</ref> This appeal on behalf of unity and mutual toleration nevertheless centers on submission to the state and military service. One of Celsus's bitterest complaints is that Christians refused to cooperate with civil society and held local customs and the ancient religions in contempt. The Christians viewed these as idolatrous and inspired by evil spirits, whereas polytheists like Celsus thought of them as the works of the Daemons, or the god's ministers, who ruled mankind in his place to keep him from the ''pollution of mortality''.<ref>Glover, p. 427</ref> Celsus attacks the Christians as feeding off faction and disunity, and accuses them of converting the vulgar and ignorant, while refusing to debate wise men.<ref>Glover, p. 410</ref> As for their opinions regarding their sacred mission and exclusive holiness, Celsus responds by deriding their insignificance, comparing them to ''a swarm of bats, or ants creeping out of their nest, or frogs holding a symposium round a swamp, or worms in conventicle in a corner of the mud''.<ref>Glover, p. 412</ref>  It is not known how many were Christians at the time of Celsus (the Jewish population of the empire may have been about 6.6–10% in a population of 60 million to quote one reference).<ref>[[Robert Louis Wilken]], ''The Christians as the Romans Saw Them'', (Yale: University Press, 2nd edition, 2003)</ref>
