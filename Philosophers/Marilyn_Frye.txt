'''Marilyn Frye''' (born 1941) is an American philosopher and [[radical feminist]] theorist.  She is known for her theories on [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[oppression]], and sexuality.  Her writings offer discussions of feminist topics, such as: [[white supremacy]], [[male privilege]], and gay and lesbian [[marginalization]]. Although she approaches the issues from the perspective of justice, she is also engaged with the [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[moral psychology]] of social categories.

==Education and career==
Frye received a BA with honors in philosophy from [[Stanford University]] in 1963 and a PhD in philosophy at [[Cornell University]] in 1969. She wrote her dissertation, titled ''Meaning and Illocutionary Force'', under the supervision of [[Max Black]]. Before coming to [[Michigan State University]] in 1974, she taught in the philosophy department at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. From 2003 until her retirement, Frye was University Distinguished Professor at [[Michigan State University]]; she also served as Associate Dean for Graduate Studies of the College of Arts and Letters. In 2008 she was the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] Romanell Lecturer.

==Research and publications==
Frye is the author of ''[[The Politics of Reality]]''<ref>Frye, Marilyn. The Politics of Reality: Essays in Feminist Theory, The Crossing Press, 1983, {{ISBN|0-89594-099-X}}, p175</ref> (1983), a collection of nine essays which has become a "classic" of feminist philosophy.<ref name=Cudd>{{cite journal|last=Cudd|first=Ann|title=Frye, Marilyn (1941-)|journal=Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2006}}</ref>
 
In her chapter entitled "Oppression" in the book ''Feminist Frontiers'', Frye discusses the idea of the [[double bind]] in gender. This double bind refers to "situations in which options are reduced to a very few and all of them expose one to penalty, censure or deprivation". Frye applies this principle to gender and the dilemma women often face in her discussion of oppression. For example, it is neither socially acceptable for a woman to be sexually active or for her to be sexually inactive and labelled a "man-hater" or "uptight". This absence of choice permeates so thoroughly into women's day-to-day life that even small things like how they choose to dress or talk are criticized. Frye acknowledges that men face issues as well, but differentiates the issues of men and women through the metaphor of a bird cage. As Frye tells it, each individual bind women face can be thought of as a single bar in a cage: by itself, it isn't enough to contain the bird. But, with enough bars, the bird is trapped inside the cage, left with nowhere to go. This is the complete absence of choice Frye describes: how it is the culmination of issues women face that is so "immobilizing" and why, for Frye, their struggle—and not men's—is considered [[oppression]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Feminist Frontiers|last=Frye|first=Marilyn|year=2007|edition=7th|pages=7–9|chapter=Oppression}}</ref>
