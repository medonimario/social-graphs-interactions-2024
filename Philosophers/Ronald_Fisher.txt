Fisher held strong views on [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] and [[eugenics]], insisting on racial differences. Although he was clearly a eugenicist, there is some debate as to whether Fisher supported [[scientific racism]] (see {{section link|2=Views on race}}). He was the [[Galton Laboratory|Galton Professor]] of Eugenics at [[University College London]] and editor of the [[Annals of Eugenics]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=UCL|accessdate=2021-03-12|title=Ronald A Fisher|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/departments/genetics-evolution-and-environment/research/ucl-centre-computational-biology/ronald-fisher|date=13 February 2019|website=UCL Division of Biosciences}}</ref>

He entered [[Harrow School]] age 14 and won the school's Neeld Medal in mathematics. In 1909, he won a scholarship to study [[Mathematics]] at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]. In 1912, he gained a First in [[Mathematics]].<ref>The Historical Register of the University of Cambridge, Supplement, 1911–1920</ref>

==Career==
During 1913–1919, Fisher worked as a statistician in the City of London and taught [[physics]] and maths at a sequence of [[public school (UK)|public schools]], at the [[Thames Nautical Training College]], and at [[Bradfield College]]. There he settled with his new bride, Eileen Guinness, with whom he had two sons and six daughters.<ref name=box>Box, ''R. A. Fisher'', pp. 35–50</ref>

In 1918 he published "[[The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]", in which he introduced the term [[variance]] and proposed its formal analysis.<ref>{{ cite journal | title=The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance | first1=Ronald A. | last1=Fisher | journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh | year=1918 | volume=52 | issue=2 | pages=399–433 | doi=10.1017/s0080456800012163| s2cid=181213898 | url=https://zenodo.org/record/1428666 }}</ref> He put forward a [[Additive model|genetics conceptual model]] showing that [[quantitative trait locus|continuous variation]] amongst [[phenotypic trait]]s measured by biostatisticians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes and thus be the result of [[Mendelian inheritance]].

In 1919, he began working at the [[Rothamsted Research|Rothamsted Experimental Station]] in Hertfordshire, where he would remain for 14 years.<ref name=russ/> He had been offered a position at the [[Galton Laboratory]] in [[University College London]] led by [[Karl Pearson]], but instead accepted a temporary role at Rothamsted to investigate the possibility of analysing the vast amount of crop data accumulated since 1842 from the "Classical Field Experiments". He analysed the data recorded over many years, and in 1921 published ''Studies in Crop Variation I'', his first application of the [[analysis of variance]] (ANOVA).<ref>{{ cite journal | title=) Studies in Crop Variation.

Fisher's 1924 article ''On a distribution yielding the error functions of several well known statistics'' presented [[Pearson's chi-squared test]] and [[William Sealy Gosset|William Gosset]]'s [[Student's t-distribution]] in the same framework as the [[Gaussian distribution]], and is where he developed [[Fisher's z-distribution]], a new statistical method commonly used decades later as the [[F-distribution|''F''-distribution]].

Fisher formalized and popularized use of the [[p-value]] in statistics, which plays a central role in his approach. Fisher proposes the level p=0.05, or a 1 in 20 chance of being exceeded by chance, as a limit for statistical significance, and applies this to a normal distribution (as a two-tailed test), yielding the rule of two standard deviations (on a normal distribution) for statistical significance.<ref>{{ cite book | url=https://www.jerrydallal.com/LHSP/LHSP.htm | title=The Little Handbook of Statistical Practice | last1=Dallal | first1=Gerard E. | year=2012 }}</ref> The significance of [[1.96]], the approximate value of the 97.5 percentile point of the normal distribution used in probability and statistics, also originated in this book.

In 1930, ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'' was first published by [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] and is dedicated to [[Leonard Darwin]].

One of Fisher's favourite aphorisms was "Natural selection is a mechanism for generating an exceedingly high degree of improbability."<ref>[https://www.genetics.org/content/154/4/1419.full ''The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection'']. It was first reported in 1936 by Julian Huxley and often repeated in Huxley's work (e.g., 1942, 1954) until it finally passed into the language unattributed through the writings of C. H. Waddington, Gavin de Beer, Ernst Mayr, and Richard Dawkins.</ref>

Fisher's fame grew, and he began to travel and lecture widely. In 1931, he spent six weeks at the Statistical Laboratory at [[Iowa State College]] where he gave three lectures per week, and met many American statisticians, including [[George W. Snedecor]]. He returned there again in 1936.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===University College London, 1933–1943===
In 1933, Fisher became the head of the Department of [[Eugenics]] at [[University College London]].<ref>[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department/history Department History], Department of Statistics, [[University College London]].</ref> In 1934, he become editor of the ''Annals of Eugenics'' (now called ''[[Annals of Human Genetics]]'').

In 1935, he published ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'', which was "also fundamental, [and promoted] statistical technique and application... The mathematical justification of the methods was not stressed and proofs were often barely sketched or omitted altogether .... [This] led [[Henry Mann|H.B.

In this book Fisher also outlined the [[Lady tasting tea]], now a famous [[design of experiments|design]] of a statistical [[randomized experiment]] which uses [[Fisher's exact test]] and is the original exposition of Fisher's notion of a [[null hypothesis]].<ref>Fisher, R.

==Personal life and beliefs==
[[File:Ronald Fisher with his sons.png|thumb|Ronald Fisher with his sons]]

Fisher married Eileen Guinness, with whom he had two sons and six daughters.<ref name=box/>
His marriage disintegrated during [[World War II]], and his older son George, an [[aviator]], was killed in combat.<ref>Box, ''R. A. Fisher'', p. 396</ref> His daughter Joan, who wrote a biography of her father, married the statistician [[George E. P. Box]].<ref>Box, Joan Fisher (1978) ''R. A. Fisher: The Life of a Scientist'' [https://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Fisher_Life.html Preface], {{ISBN|0-471-09300-9}}</ref>

According to Yates and Mather, "His large family, in particular, reared in conditions of great financial stringency, was a personal expression of his genetic and evolutionary convictions."<ref name="frs"/> Fisher was noted for being loyal, and was seen as a patriot, a member of the [[Church of England]], politically [[conservative]], as well as a scientific rationalist. He developed a reputation for carelessness in his dress and was the archetype of the absent-minded professor. [[H. Allen Orr]] describes him in the ''Boston Review'' as a "deeply devout [[Anglican]] who, between founding modern statistics and population genetics, penned articles for church magazines".<ref>[https://bostonreview.net/BR24.5/orr.html Gould on God: Can religion and science be happily reconciled?] bostonreview.net</ref> In a 1955 broadcast on Science and Christianity,<ref name="frs"/> he said:

{{blockquote|The custom of making abstract dogmatic assertions is not, certainly, derived from the teaching of [[Jesus]], but has been a widespread weakness among religious teachers in subsequent centuries. I do not think that the word for the Christian virtue of faith should be prostituted to mean the credulous acceptance of all such piously intended assertions. Much self-deception in the young believer is needed to convince himself that he knows that of which in reality he knows himself to be ignorant. That surely is hypocrisy, against which we have been most conspicuously warned.}}

Fisher was involved with the [[Society for Psychical Research]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=Chris |title=Science and the Afterlife Experience: Evidence for the Immortality of Consciousness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVsoDwAAQBAJ |publisher=Simon and Schuster |date=2012 |isbn=978-1594774997 }}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=(Research with Ronald Fisher) |journal=Journal of the Society for Psychical Research |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwR-AAAAMAAJ |year=1967 |publisher=Society for Psychical Research |volume=44 |issue=738 |page=392 |quote=The targets (one-figure numbers and letters of the alphabet) were pasted on the backs of visiting cards, which were put into random order either by shuffling or by the use of random number tables loaned us by Professor Sir Ronald Fisher.}}</ref>

==Views on race==
Between 1950 and 1951, Fisher, along with other leading geneticists and anthropologists of his time, was asked to comment on a statement that [[UNESCO]] was preparing on the nature of race and racial differences, which was published in 1950 as the UNESCO ''[[UNESCO statements on race#Statement on the nature of race and race differences (1951)|Statement on Race]]''. The statement, along with the comments and criticisms of a large number of scientists including Fisher, is published in "The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry" (1952).<ref name=UNESCO1952>{{cite web |url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000733/073351eo.pdf |title=The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry |publisher=UNESCO |year=1952}}</ref>

Fisher was one of four scientists who opposed the statement. In his own words, Fisher's opposition is based on "one fundamental objection to the Statement", which "destroys the very spirit of the whole document." He believes that human groups differ profoundly "in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development" and concludes from this that the "practical international problem is that of learning to share the resources of this planet amicably with persons of materially different nature, and that this problem is being obscured by entirely well-intentioned efforts to minimize the real differences that exist."<ref>{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Copeman |year=2008 |title=God's First Fisherman |location=Cape Town |page=124 |isbn=978-3634000714}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Gavin |last=Evans |date=29 August 2019 |title=Skin Deep: Journeys in the Divisive Science of Race |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1786076236}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Mona Sue |last=Weissmark |date=1 May 2020 |title=The Science of Diversity |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=24 |isbn=978-0190686369}}</ref>

Fisher's opinions are clarified by his more detailed comments on Section 5 of the statement, which are concerned with psychological and mental differences between the races. Section 5 concludes as follows:

{{blockquote|Scientifically, however, we realized that any common psychological attribute is more likely to be due to a common historical and social background, and that such attributes may obscure the fact that, within different populations consisting of many human types, one will find approximately the same range of temperament and intelligence.<ref name= UNESCO1952/>{{rp|14}}}}

Of the entire statement, Section 5 recorded the most dissenting viewpoints.  It was recorded that "Fisher's attitude … is the same as [[Hermann Joseph Muller|Muller]]'s and [[Alfred Sturtevant|Sturtevant]]'s".<ref name= UNESCO1952/>{{rp|56}} Muller's criticism was recorded in more detail and was noted to "represent an important trend of ideas":

{{blockquote|I quite agree with the chief intention of the article as a whole, which, I take it, is to bring out the relative unimportance of such genetic mental differences between races as may exist, in contrast to the importance of the mental differences (between individuals as well as between nations) caused by tradition, training and other aspects of the environment.  However, in view of the admitted existence of some physically expressed hereditary differences of a conspicuous nature, between the averages or the medians of the races, it would be strange if there were not also some hereditary differences affecting the mental characteristics which develop in a given environment, between these averages or medians.  At the same time, these mental differences might usually be unimportant in comparison with those between individuals of the same race…. To the great majority of geneticists it seems absurd to suppose that psychological characteristics are subject to entirely different laws of heredity or development than other biological characteristics. Even though the former characteristics are far more influenced than the latter by environment, in the form of past experiences, they must have a highly complex genetic basis.<ref name= UNESCO1952/>{{rp|52}}}}

Fisher's own words were quoted as follows:

{{blockquote|As you ask for remarks and suggestions, there is one that occurs to me, unfortunately of a somewhat fundamental nature, namely that the Statement as it stands appears to draw a distinction between the body and mind of men, which must, I think, prove untenable.  It appears to me unmistakable that gene differences which influence the growth or physiological development of an organism will ordinarily [[pari passu]] influence the congenital inclinations and capacities of the mind.  In fact, I should say that, to vary conclusion (2) on page 5, 'Available scientific knowledge provides a firm basis for believing that the groups of mankind differ in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development,' seeing that such groups do differ undoubtedly in a very large number of their genes.<ref name= UNESCO1952/>{{rp|56}}}}
Fisher also ended a 1954 letter to [[Reginald Ruggles Gates]], a Canadian-born geneticist who argued that different racial groups were different species, with the words:
{{Blockquote|text=I am sorry that there should be propaganda in favour of [[miscegenation]] in North America as I am sure it can do nothing but harm. Is it beyond human endeavour to give and justly administer equal rights to all citizens without fooling ourselves that these are equivalent items?<ref name="bodmer21">{{cite journal|last1=Bodmer|first1=Walter|last2=et.|first2=al.|date=2021|title=The outstanding scientist, R.A.

Fisher's writings nearly all discuss human populations or humanity as a whole without reference to race or specific racial groups, and none of his work explicitly supports the idea of racial superiority or white supremacy.<ref name="bodmer21" /> Fisher had a close personal relationship with Indian statistician [[P.C. Mahalanobis]], and significantly contributed to the development of the [[Indian Statistical Institute]]; and Fisher's graduate students included [[Walter Bodmer]], a child of Jewish-German parents who fled from Nazi Germany while he was young, and [[Ebenezer Laing]], an African geneticist from Ghana.<ref name="bodmer21" /> [[Daniel Kevles]], an American [[historian of science]], described Fisher as an "anti-racist conservative".<ref name="bodmer21" /> However, British historian Robert J. Evans, writing in ''[[The New Statesman & Nation|The New Statesman]]'', argued that Fisher's views on eugenics and his opposition to UNESCO's statement about genetic racial differences were indicative of racism.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Evans |first=Richard J. |date=2020-07-28 |title=RA Fisher and the science of hatred |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2020/07/ra-fisher-and-science-hatred |access-date=2022-03-14 |website=New Statesman |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Eugenics==
{{Eugenics sidebar|pre-war academics}}
In 1911, Fisher became founding Chairman of the University of Cambridge Eugenics Society, whose other founding members included [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[R. C. Punnett]], and [[Horace Darwin]]. After members of the Cambridge Society – including Fisher – stewarded the First International Eugenics Congress in London in summer 1912, a link was forged with the [[Eugenics Society (UK)]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fisher Box |first1=Joan |title=R.A. Fisher, the life of a scientist |year=1978 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-09300-8 |pages=26–27}}</ref> He saw [[eugenics]] as addressing pressing social and scientific issues that encompassed and drove his interest in both genetics and statistics. During World War I Fisher started writing book reviews for ''[[The Eugenics Review]]'' and volunteered to undertake all such reviews for the journal, being hired for a part-time position.

The last third of ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'' focused on eugenics, attributing the fall of [[civilization]]s to the fertility of their upper classes being diminished, and used British 1911 census data to show an inverse relationship between fertility and social class, which was partly due, he claimed, to the lower financial costs and hence increasing social status of families with fewer children. He proposed the abolition of extra allowances to large families, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father.<ref name=Adelaide>{{cite web |title=Series 12.

Beginning in 1934, Fisher became disillusioned with the Eugenics Society over concerns that its activities were increasingly aimed in a political rather than scientific direction; he formally dissociated with the Society in 1941.<ref name="bodmer21" />

Fisher wrote a testimony on behalf of the eugenicist [[Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer]].

The [[R. A. Fisher Lectureship]] was a North American [[Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies]] (COPSS) annual lecture prize, established in 1963, until the name was changed to COPSS Distinguished Achievement Award and Lectureship in 2020. On 28 April 1998 a minor planet, [[21451 Fisher]], was named after him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=21451|title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser|website=ssd.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>

In 2010, the R.A. Fisher Chair in Statistical Genetics was established in University College London to recognise Fisher's extraordinary contributions to both statistics and genetics.

[[Anders Hald]] called Fisher "a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science",<ref name="Hald98">{{cite book |last=Hald |first=Anders |author-link=Anders Hald |year=1998 |title=A History of Mathematical Statistics |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-17912-2}} p.738.</ref> while [[Richard Dawkins]] named him "the greatest biologist since [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]": <blockquote>Not only was he the most original and constructive of the architects of the neo-Darwinian synthesis, Fisher also was the father of modern statistics and experimental design. He therefore could be said to have provided researchers in biology and medicine with their most important research tools, as well as with the modern version of biology's central theorem.<ref>{{cite web |author=Dawkins, Richard |author-link=Richard Dawkins |date=2010 |title=Who is the Greatest Biologist Since Darwin?

[[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] said of him:<blockquote>To biologists, he was an architect of the "modern synthesis" that used mathematical models to integrate Mendelian genetics with Darwin's selection theories.

=== Contentious views on eugenics ===
Fisher and Sewall Wright both contributed to the development of [[population genetics]], which became part of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]. The interpretation of the mathematical theories of population genetics became a bone of contention between Fisher and Wright by the mid-1920s, and the issue became acrimonious.
