'''Aleksei Fyodorovich Losev''' ({{langx|ru|Алексе́й Фёдорович Ло́сев}}; 22 September 1893 – 24 May 1988) was a Soviet and Russian [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Philology|philologist]] and [[culturology|culturologist]], one of the most prominent figures in [[Russian philosophy|Russian philosophical]] and [[philosophy of religion|religious thought]] of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.transculturalstudies.com/article/view/311 |last=Takho-Godi |first=Elena A. |journal=Transcultural Studies |volume=4 |title=Aleksei Losev's Philosophical Novel 'The Woman Thinker' and the Problem of the Eternal Feminine |year=2008 |pages=119–127 |publisher=Charles Schlacks |location=Idyllwild, California |doi=10.1163/23751606-00401009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130630111343/http://www.transculturalstudies.com/article/view/311 |archive-date=2013-06-30 }} Special Issue: Sophia Across Culture: From Old Testament to Postmodernity.</ref>

==Early life==
Losev was born in [[Novocherkassk]], the administrative center of the [[Don Host Oblast]], the far western Russian territory held by the [[Don Cossacks]] on the banks of the [[Don (river)|Don River]]. He was named after his maternal grandfather, Aleksei Polyakov; a priest in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=Marchenkov2003>{{cite book |last=Marchenkov |first=Vladimir Leonidovich |title=Aleksei Losev and His Theory of Myth |year=2003}} (The introduction to Marchenkov's English translation of ''The Dialectics of Myth'', {{ISBN|0203633733}})</ref> Losev's paternal great-grandfather was also named Aleksei, and was awarded for heroism during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], while fighting in a Cossack Brigade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kongord.ru/Index/Screst/sk137-10.htm |language=Russian |title=Monument to the Don Cossacks on the Arbat |first=Alexander |last=Shevchenko |work=Religion in Contemporary Society |publisher=Konstantin Gordeev |access-date=May 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829175852/http://www.kongord.ru/Index/Screst/sk137-10.htm |archive-date=August 29, 2014 }}</ref> Losev's father was Fyodor Petrovich Losev, a violinist and conductor by avocation and a teacher of mathematics and physics by trade. Attracted to a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, Losev's father left the family in the hands of his wife, Natalya Alekseyevna Loseva (née Polyakova), who raised Losev as an [[only child]] at her father's house.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/>

Losev was schooled in the [[classics]] at [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] from the age of ten. He was little interested in his studies until he was introduced to philosophy. As well, he became fascinated by astronomy after reading a book by [[Camille Flammarion]]. His early interest in music continued, and he considered a career as a violinist.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/>

In his final year of gymnasium, Losev received a gift from his professor: an eight-volume set of writings by Russian philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], which influenced him greatly. Losev entered [[Moscow State University|Moscow University]] in 1911. He held season tickets to the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] where he watched every opera he could. During a study visit to Berlin, his luggage was stolen, including his books and all of his manuscripts. The trip was cut short by the start of [[World War I]].<ref name=Marchenkov2003/>

==Career==
Losev graduated with a [[double degree]]—philology and philosophy—in 1915. He stayed at Moscow Imperial University to prepare for a position as lecturer in Classical Philology.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/> In 1916 he published his first paper, "Eros in Plato".<ref name=Khoruzhii>{{cite journal |url=http://synergia-isa.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/hor_losev.pdf |last=Khoruzhii |first=Sergei Sergeevich |title=A Rearguard Action |editor=M. E. Sharpe |year=2002 |volume=40 |number=3 |journal=Russian Studies in Philosophy |pages=30–68 |doi=10.2753/RSP1061-1967400330 |s2cid=170834095 }} English translator: Stephen Shenfield. First published in Russian in 1994 in ''Posle pereryva. Puti russkoi filosofii'' as "Ar'ergardnyi boi".</ref> When Russia erupted in the 1917 [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s, Losev kept a low profile, spending all of his time writing and studying. In 1919, [[typhus]] killed his mother. The same year, Losev's paper "Russian Philosophy" was published in a German-language volume composed of various articles about Russian cultural development. Losev was unaware of this publication until 1983. It was finally published in the Russian language after Losev's death.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/>

After the revolution, the [[Bolsheviks]] stopped the teaching of the classics at Moscow University. In 1919, Losev became a professor of classical philology at the newly opened [[N. I. Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod|University of Nizhny Novgorod]]. He also found work teaching [[aesthetics]] at the State Institute of Musical Science, at the State Academy of Artistic Science, and at the [[Moscow Conservatory]] where he was named professor.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/>

Losev married Valentina Mikhailovna Sokolova on 5 June 1922; she was a student of mathematics and astronomy who was five years younger than Losev. He had seen her since 1917 when he began renting a room from her parents in Moscow.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/> [[Pavel Florensky]], a former priest and physicist working on the official [[GOELRO|GOELRO plan]] to bring electrical utility service to Russia, performed the wedding ceremony in [[Sergiyev Posad]]. Losev and his wife found they were matched artistically, intellectually and also spiritually; they both sought higher understanding in the study of Russian religion under [[Archimandrite]] David. [[Religion in the Soviet Union|Religion was being suppressed]] by the Bolsheviks, so this study was conducted in secret. On 3 June 1929 the two were ordained monks in the Russian Orthodox Church in a private ceremony officiated by David. They took the monastic names Andronik and Afanasiya. The Losevs successfully hid their monastic status from the public until five years after Losev's death in 1988.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/>

==Conflict with Communism==
Losev wrote eight monograph volumes, beginning the work in 1923.<ref name=Khoruzhii/> The titles were: ''The Ancient Cosmos and Modern Science'', ''The Philosophy of Name'', ''The Dialectics of Artistic Form'', ''The Dialectics of Number in Plotinus'', ''Criticism of Platonism by Aristotle'', ''Music as a Subject of Logic'', ''Essays on Classical Symbolism and Mythology'', and ''The Dialectics of Myth''.<ref name="ISFP">{{cite web|last=Takho-Godi|first=Aza A.|editor=Dmitry Olshansky|editor2=Robert Barsky|editor3=Maryse Dennes|editor4=Geoffrey Klempner|editor5=John McCannon|editor6=[[Henrietta Mondry]]|title=Alexey Losev|url=http://www.isfp.co.uk/russian_thinkers/alexey_losev.html|url-status=live|access-date=May 11, 2013|work=Gallery of Russian Thinkers|publisher=International Society for Philosophers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006222817/http://www.isfp.co.uk/russian_thinkers/alexey_losev.html |archive-date=2006-10-06 }}</ref> The series was to conclude with a ninth volume but ''The Dialectics of Myth'' caused a great deal of controversy, and Losev never finished the final monograph.<ref name=Khoruzhii/>

In these works, Losev synthesized the ideas of Russian philosophy of the early 20th century, of Christian [[Neo-platonism]], dialectics of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]. In 1930's ''The Dialectics of Myth'', Losev rejected [[dialectical materialism]] and proposed that myth ([[idea]]) should be treated on equal terms with physical [[matter]].<ref name=Khoruzhii/>

''The Dialectics of Myth'' identified as false the constructs of the Soviet system; it pointed out the absurdity of the myths associated with state [[ideology]], and with the dogma of [[Communism]]. Soviet officials reacted quickly to suppress the book. On 18 April 1930 Losev was arrested and held in [[solitary confinement]] in the basement prison of the [[Lubyanka Building]]. His wife Valentina was arrested on 5 June 1930; the couple's eighth wedding anniversary. Marianna Gerasimova, an investigator with the [[Joint State Political Directorate]] (OGPU), an agency of secret police, was assigned to investigate Losev with the goal of proving that he was a leader of the secret religious splinter group called [[Onomatodoxy]], based on the idea that the [[Names of God|Name of God]] is [[God]] Himself, and that Losev was involved in planning violence against the Soviet government. Losev was indeed associated with Onomatodoxy but his role was theological, not practical. Gerasimova led a team of investigators who gathered and fabricated evidence over the course of 17 months while Losev was held in prison. Gerasimova listed false claims against Losev such as his being a member of the [[Black Hundreds]], an [[Antisemitism|antisemite]], and a religious bigot and fanatic. Losev's library and writings were seized, and his dwelling was lived in by an agent of OGPU.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/>

In the summer of 1930, the [[16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|16th Communist Congress]] met, and Losev's case was discussed. The book was denounced by politician [[Lazar Kaganovich]] and playwright [[Vladimir Kirshon]] who said "for such nuances put him up against a wall" to be executed.<ref name=Khoruzhii/> All 500 copies of the book were seized and destroyed.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/> After 4 months in Lubyanka, Losev was transferred to [[Butyrka prison|Butyrskaia Prison]] where he was held for 13 more months. The Losevs were sentenced for his "militant idealism": Valentina to five years and Aleksei to ten years of hard labor in Northern Russia. Losev was sent to [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s to work on the construction of the [[White Sea–Baltic Canal]].<ref name=ISFP/> Initially, he was put to work hauling timber, but his health failed and he was assigned night watchman at a timber storage facility.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/> There he began to gradually lose his vision due to malnutrition,<ref name=Khoruzhii/> though he was reunited with his wife in 1932 at [[Belbaltlag]] labor camp.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/> In December 1931, [[Maxim Gorky]] wrote acidly in ''[[Pravda]]'' and in ''[[Izvestia]]'' that he regretted Losev was still alive to foul the Soviet air.<ref name=Khoruzhii/><ref>{{cite book |last=Seifrid |first=Thomas |title=The Word Made Self: Russian Writings on Language, 1860–1930 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wordmadeselfruss00seif/page/168 168] |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0801443164 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/wordmadeselfruss00seif/page/168 }}</ref>

Ironically, it was Gorky's first wife who obtained Losev's release from Gulag. [[Yekaterina Peshkova]], formerly an activist with the [[Political Red Cross]] and in the 1930s the chair of the follow-on group Assistance to Political Prisoners, worked to free Losev, finally succeeding in late 1932 to overturn his conviction.<ref name=Khoruzhii/>

==Post-arrest career==
After returning to Moscow in mid-1933, Losev was allowed to pursue his academic career and to teach. [[Ancient philosophy]], [[idea|myth]] and [[aesthetics]] became his "inner exile": he was able to express his own [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritualist]] beliefs.

Losev had been very admiring of the famous pianist [[Maria Yudina]]. He had met with her at his Moscow home in early April 1930, prior to a concert she performed on April 16.<ref name=Word2009>{{cite journal |url=http://www.portal-slovo.ru/philology/40392.php |script-title=ru:Глава первая. Основные этапы творчества А.Ф. Лосева |last=Takho-Godi |first=Elena A. |date=January 31, 2009 |journal=Слово |language=Russian }} (''Word'' magazine, article title "The art of A.F. Losev's prose")</ref> Soon afterward, Losev was arrested because of his book ''The Dialectics of Myth''. When he returned home in 1933, he wrote a novel using Yudina as the model: ''Woman as Thinker'', or ''The Woman Thinker''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Vitebsk: the life of art |first=Aleksandra Semënovna |last=Šatskih |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0300101089 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cg4kkYvTKw4C&pg=PA308 |page=308}}</ref> The flawed heroine Losev created, Maria Valentinovna Radina, was a woman musician who spouted high-minded philosophy but slipped to lower standards in her personal life. The novel has been criticized as an outlet for Losev's difficult relationship with Yudina, and as a poor example of his capabilities as a writer.<ref>{{cite book |title=Booker Winners and Others |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookerwinnersoth0000unse/page/227 227] |first1=Natalii͡a |last1=Perova |first2=A. L. |last2=Tait |year=1994 |publisher=Russlit |isbn=0939010437 |volume=7 |series=Glas new Russian writing |url=https://archive.org/details/bookerwinnersoth0000unse/page/227 }}</ref> Yudina disliked the character of Maria which she recognized as herself, and in early 1934 she broke with Losev, never to see him again.<ref name=Word2009/>

During the 1930s, Losev composed what he intended to be a definitive work on classic aesthetics, titled ''A History of Ancient Aesthetics''. The manuscript was lost along with everything else in his Moscow apartment when it was hit by a German bomb in 1941.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/> In 1943, Losev was awarded a doctorate degree in the classics ''[[Honorary degree|honoris causa]]'': from the mass of work previously accomplished. From 1942 to 1944, Losev taught at Moscow University and from 1944 on at the [[Moscow State Pedagogical University]]. Also in 1944, the Losevs brought a young post-graduate student into their home—Aza Alibekovna Takho-Godi—who continued in her studies of classical philology. Both the Losevs grew fond of Takho-Godi; when Valentina died from cancer on 29 January 1954 it was with her blessing that Losev and Takho-Godi would join in marriage. Takho-Godi became Losev's second wife and eventually his widow.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/>

Losev published some 30 monographs between the 1950s and 1970s. With regards to Western philosophy of the time, Losev criticized severely the [[Structuralism|structuralist]] thinking.

In the USSR, his works were censored while he was praised as one of the greatest philosophers of the time. He was even awarded the [[USSR State Prize]] in 1986 for his eight-volume ''History of Classical Aesthetics'', two years before his death.

==Controversies==
In 1996, a controversy arose when author [[Konstantin Polivanov]], Jewish studies historian [[Leonid Katsis]], and journalist Dmitrii Shusharin published three articles that described Losev as an [[Antisemitism|antisemite]] who bargained with [[Joseph Stalin]] for his release from exile. According to translator Vladimir Leonidovich Marchenkov these three articles appearing in Russian newspaper Segodnya were a coordinated series of accusations.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/> Katsis compared Losev's supposed relationship with Stalin to the relationship between [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], with Rosenberg helping to shape Hitler's ideology.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/> Olesya Nikolaeva responded to deny this assertion in the Russian Orthodox newspaper ''Radonezh'': "The logic of the Bolshevist secret police" (1996). Losev's widow Aza Alibekovna Takho-Godi wrote a rebuttal of the claims in the magazine ''[[Russkaya mysl]]''; to disprove the assertions she printed letters written by Losev to the state censors. The popular science magazine ''[[Rodina (magazine)|Rodina]]'' moved to settle the matter by publishing materials from the 1930–31 [[OGPU]] case file, which for the first time publicly demonstrated how Soviet secret police fabricated evidence against Losev.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/>

Swiss Slavicist [[Felix Philipp Ingold]] followed with "''Zerbrechende Mythen''" ("Crumbling myths") in 1996, in support of the idea that Losev was antisemitic.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/> Professor Alexander Haardt of [[Ruhr University Bochum]] responded to Ingold by defending Losev's reputation. Haardt said that Losev's legacy should not be smeared by a few words but judged by the whole of his life's work. He said the antisemitic statements listed in Gerasimova's politically motivated investigation from 1930 to 1931 could not be trusted as originating from Losev. Losev's defenders characterized him as a principled critic of all religions including Protestantism, Judaism, and his own orthodoxy, and said that he was never anti-Jew. He was also said to be in approval of Communist totalitarianism even while he freely criticized the emptiness of Communist ideology. Russian philosopher [[Leonid Stolovich]] wrote very strongly against those who called Losev an antisemite, the article titled "Losev should not be handed over as a gift to the Black Hundred followers!"<ref name=Marchenkov2003/> He said that mitigating documents that should have been included in the OGPU investigation case files appeared to be missing, likely because they did not support the antisemitic conclusions.<ref name=Marchenkov2003/> In 1999, Katsis re-examined the issue in light of the letters and files published in late 1996. He found the issue to be more nuanced than he previously thought, and agreed that "all attempts to distort" Losev's legacy were "politically motivated".<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Logos |title=AF Losev, VS Soloviev, Maxim Gorky: A retrospective view of 1999 |last=Katsis |first=Leonid |date=April 1999 |number=14 |pages=68–95 |url=http://www.ruthenia.ru/logos/number/1999_04/1999_4_06.htm |language=Russian |access-date=May 12, 2013}}</ref>

Losev also entered into the controversy raging within Eastern Orthodoxy over the nature of the Name of God, siding with and clearly articulating the [[Imiaslavie]] position which was at odds with the official stance taken by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].<ref>[http://www.cjoc.ca/pdf/Vol_7_3_2_Imiaslavie.pdf Dn. Lasha Tchantouridzé, “In the Name of God: 100 Years of the Imiaslavie Movement in the Church of Russia”; The Canadian Journal of Orthodox Christianity Volume VII, Number 3, Fall 2012; p. 225]</ref>
