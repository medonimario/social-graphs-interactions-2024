==Biography==
G. H. von Wright<ref>An explanation of the [[von Wright]] name is given in [[iarchive:philosophyofgeor0000unse/page/n24/mode/1up|"Georg Henrik von Wright: Intellectual Autobiography"]] (in: Schilpp, 1989): "Around the year 1650, the earliest known members of my family had to leave Scotland because, it is said, they had sided with King Charles against Cromwell. They settled in Narva in Estonia, which was then a province under Swedish rule. [https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/ssne/item.php?id=1649 Georg(e) Wright] there begat [https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/ssne/item.php?id=4942 Henrik Wright], who fought in the armies of [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] and after a long and eventful life died in his home in Finland, another part of the old Swedish realm. Henrik Wright's son Georg Henrik was, together with his three other sons, raised to noble rank after the royal coup d'etat of 1772. This was how the odd combination of 'von' and 'Wright' originated." </ref> was born in Helsinki on 14 June 1916 to Tor von Wright and his wife Ragni Elisabeth Alfthan.<ref name="hacker" />

On the retirement of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] as professor at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1948, von Wright succeeded him.<ref name="hacker">{{cite news |last=Hacker |first=P. M.

==Work==
Von Wright's writings come under two broad categories. The first is [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophical logic]] in the Anglo-American vein. His 1951 texts ''An Essay in Modal Logic'' and "Deontic Logic" were landmarks in the postwar rise of formal modal logic and its [[deontic logic|deontic]] version. He was an authority on Wittgenstein, editing his later works. He was the leading figure in the Finnish philosophy of his time, specializing in philosophical logic, [[philosophical analysis]], [[philosophy of action]], [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and the close study of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

The other vein in von Wright's writings is [[morality|moralist]] and [[pessimism|pessimist]]. During the last twenty years of his life, under the influence of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Jürgen Habermas]] and the [[Frankfurt School]]'s reflections about modern [[rationality]], he wrote prolifically. His best known article from this period is entitled "The Myth of Progress" (1993), and it questions whether our apparent material and technological progress can really be considered "[[progress]]" (see [[Myth of Progress]]).

==Awards==
In the last year of his life, he was awarded several [[honorary degree]]s, including one by the [[University of Bergen]].<ref>{{cite news |date=17 January 2002 |title=Nytt om navn |language=no |page=14 |work=[[Aftenposten]]}}</ref> He also was awarded the [[Swedish Academy Finland Prize]] in 1968.
