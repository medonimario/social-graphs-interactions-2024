==Early life and background==
Varma was born on 7 April 1962 in a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] family to Krishnam Raju Varma and Suryavathi. In an interview with [[Lakshmi Manchu]] on a talk show Varma said that he was born in Nampally [[Hyderabad]] He did his schooling at [[St. Mary's High School, Secunderabad]]<ref>and completed Intermediate from New Science college Ameerpet Hyderabad. {{cite news |last1=varma |first1=ram gopal |title=Dedicated to my first, memorable crush |url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/140309/entertainment-bollywood/article/dedicated-my-first-memorable-crush |work=Deccan Chronicle |date=9 March 2014}}</ref> and completed his BE degree in Civil engineering from [[Velegapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College|V.R. Siddhartha Engineering College]], Vijayawada. Even during this period, Varma remained a film buff, through his uncle. Varma would skip classes often and watch films instead. He would watch the same film repeatedly "just to watch certain scenes which interested him."<ref>{{cite web|last=Basu|first=Arundhati|title=Don of the big screen|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050702/asp/weekend/story_4921623.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127004822/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050702/asp/weekend/story_4921623.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 November 2005 |work=The Telegraph|location=India|access-date=12 September 2011|date=2 July 2005}}</ref> According to him, that is how he learned film direction.

In an interview to ''[[Tehelka]]'', Varma talked about his relationship with his parents and the reasons behind his decision to become a filmmaker.
{{blockquote|From my parents' perspective, I looked like a useless bum. It was the truth. I had no objective. I was just fascinated by people, so I used to study their behaviour. I was most fascinated by the bullies in my classroom. They were like gangsters for me. They had the guts to push around people, do things I couldn't— perhaps did not even want to do myself. But I'd want a friend like that (laughs). I used to adulate them like heroes. That was my first touch with anti-socialism. Over a period of time, I developed a low-angle fascination for larger than life people. I was always a loner – not because I was unhappy, but because I live away from myself, not just others. I like to study myself – the way I am walking, talking, behaving. My constant obsession with studying myself and other people is perhaps the primary motivation for me to be a filmmaker.<ref>{{cite web|title=I need to change my approach to films|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main34.asp?filename=hub150907ramgopalverma.asp |work=[[Tehelka]] |access-date=12 September 2011|date=15 September 2007}}</ref>}}

==Film career, craft and style==
{{Main|Ram Gopal Varma filmography}}

After a brief stint as a site engineer for Krishna Oberoi hotel in [[Hyderabad]], he put his dreams on the back burner and decided to go to Nigeria to make some money. It was at this moment that he visited a video rental library in Hyderabad. He loved the idea and decided to start one of his own at [[Ameerpet]] in Hyderabad, through which he slowly developed connections with the film world.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> His father at that time was a long time sound engineer at [[Annapurna Studios]]. After working as an assistant director in ''[[Collector Gari Abbai]]'' and ''[[Rao Gari Illu]]'', [[Akkineni Nageswara Rao]] gave him the opportunity to direct the 1989 cult blockbuster, ''[[Siva (1989 Telugu film)|Siva]]'', after being impressed by him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://70mmonline.com/WatchMovie.aspx?movieid=3279&movieName=Lakshmi%20Talk%20show%20with%20Ramgopal%20Varma|title=Lakshmi Talk Show with Ram Gopal Varma|website=70mmonline.com|access-date=12 September 2011}}</ref>

===International acclaim===
Rachel Dwyer, a reader in ''world cinema'' at the [[University of London]]-Department of South Asia, marked Varma's ''Satya'' as an experiment with a new genre, a variation of [[film noir]] that has been called ''Mumbai Noir'', of which Varma is the acknowledged master.<ref name="The Sunday Tribune – Spectrum"/><ref name="dwyer">{{cite news
