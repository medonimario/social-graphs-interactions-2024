'''Leo Strauss'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|s|t|r|aʊ|s}} {{respell|STROWSS}}; {{IPA|de|ˈleːoː ˈʃtʁaʊs|lang}}}} (September 20, 1899 – October 18, 1973) was an American scholar of [[political philosophy]]. Born in [[Germany]] to [[Jewish]] parents, Strauss later emigrated from Germany to the United States. He spent much of his career as a professor of political science at the [[University of Chicago]], where he taught several generations of students and published fifteen books.

Trained in the [[neo-Kantian]] tradition with [[Ernst Cassirer]] and immersed in the work of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]] [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], Strauss authored books on [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], and articles on [[Maimonides]] and [[Al-Farabi]]. In the late 1930s, his research focused on the texts of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], retracing their interpretation through medieval [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] and [[Jewish philosophy]], and encouraging the application of those ideas to contemporary political theory.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education===
Strauss was born on September 20, 1899, in the small town of [[Kirchhain]] in [[Hesse-Nassau]], a province of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (part of the [[German Empire]]), to Hugo Strauss and Jennie Strauss, née David. According to [[Allan Bloom]]'s 1974 obituary in ''Political Theory'', Strauss "was raised as an [[Orthodox Jew]]", but the family does not appear to have completely embraced Orthodox practice.<ref>Joachim Lüders and Ariane Wehner, ''Mittelhessen – eine Heimat für Juden? Das Schicksal der Familie Strauss aus Kirchhain'' (Central Hesse – a Homeland for Jews? The Fate of the Strauss Family from Kirchhain) 1989.</ref> Strauss himself noted that he came from a "conservative, even orthodox Jewish home", but one which knew little about Judaism except strict adherence to ceremonial laws. His father and uncle operated a farm supply and livestock business that they inherited from their father, Meyer (1835–1919), a leading member of the local Jewish community.<ref>In "A Giving of Accounts", published in ''The College'' 22 (1) and later reprinted in ''Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity''.</ref>

After attending the Kirchhain Volksschule and the Protestant Rektoratsschule, Leo Strauss was enrolled at the [[Gymnasium Philippinum]] (affiliated with the [[University of Marburg]]) in nearby [[Marburg]] (from which [[Johannes Althusius]] and [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] also graduated) in 1912, graduating in 1917. He boarded with the Marburg [[Hazzan|cantor]] Strauss (no relation), whose residence served as a meeting place for followers of the [[neo-Kantian]] philosopher [[Hermann Cohen]]. Strauss served in the German army from [[World War I]] from July 5, 1917, to December 1918.

Strauss subsequently enrolled in the [[University of Hamburg]], where he received his [[doctorate]] in 1921; his thesis, ''On the Problem of Knowledge in the Philosophical Doctrine of F. H. Jacobi'' (''Das Erkenntnisproblem in der philosophischen Lehre Fr. H. Jacobis''), was supervised by [[Ernst Cassirer]]. He also attended courses at the Universities of [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] and Marburg, including some taught by [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. Strauss joined a Jewish fraternity and worked for the German Zionist movement, which introduced him to various German Jewish intellectuals, such as [[Norbert Elias]], [[Leo Löwenthal]], [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Walter Benjamin]]. Benjamin was and remained an admirer of Strauss and his work throughout his life.<ref name="Kenneth Hart Green page 55">'' Jewish philosophy and the crisis of modernity'' (SUNY 1997), ''Leo Strauss as a Modern Jewish thinker'', Kenneth Hart Green, Leo Strauss, page 55</ref><ref name="Scholem, Gershom 1981. page 201">Scholem, Gershom. 1981.

Strauss's closest friend was [[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]] but he also was intellectually engaged with Gerhard Krüger—and also [[Karl Löwith]], [[Julius Guttmann]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], and [[Franz Rosenzweig]] (to whom Strauss dedicated his first book), as well as [[Gershom Scholem]], [[Alexander Altmann]], and the Arabist [[Paul Kraus (Arabist)|Paul Kraus]], who married Strauss's sister Bettina (Strauss and his wife later adopted Paul and Bettina Kraus's child when both parents died in the [[Middle East]]). With several of these friends, Strauss carried on vigorous epistolary exchanges later in life, many of which are published in the ''Gesammelte Schriften'' (''Collected Writings''), some in translation from the German. Strauss had also been engaged in a discourse with [[Carl Schmitt]]. However, after Strauss left Germany, he broke off the discourse when Schmitt failed to respond to his letters.

=== Career ===
After receiving a [[Rockefeller Fellowship]] in 1932, Strauss left his position at the [[Higher Institute for Jewish Studies]] in [[Berlin]] for [[Paris]]. He returned to Germany only once, for a few short days twenty years later. In Paris, he married Marie (Miriam) Bernsohn, a widow with a young child, whom he had known previously in Germany. He adopted his wife's son, Thomas, and later his sister's child, [[Jenny Strauss Clay]] (later a professor of classics at the University of Virginia); he and Miriam had no biological children of their own. At his death, he was survived by Thomas, Jenny Strauss Clay, and three grandchildren. Strauss became a lifelong friend of [[Alexandre Kojève]] and was on friendly terms with [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Étienne Gilson]]. Because of the Nazis' rise to power, he chose not to return to his native country. Strauss found shelter, after some vicissitudes, in England, where, in 1935 he gained temporary employment at the [[University of Cambridge]] with the help of his in-law [[David Daube]], who was affiliated with [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]]. While in England, he became a close friend of [[R. H. Tawney]] and was on less friendly terms with [[Isaiah Berlin]].<ref name="books.google.com">[https://books.google.com/books?id=H3QyfGR9qM4C&pg=PA87 Leo Strauss And the Politics of Exile: The Making of a Political Philosopher] p. 87</ref>

[[File:Campus Spring.jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of Chicago]], the school with which Strauss is most closely associated]]

Unable to find permanent employment in England, Strauss moved to the United States in 1937, under the patronage of [[Harold Laski]], who made introductions and helped him obtain a brief lectureship. After a short stint as a [[research fellow]] in the Department of History at [[Columbia University]], Strauss secured a position at [[The New School]], where, between 1938 and 1948, he worked in the political science faculty and also took on adjunct jobs.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eugene Sheppard|title=Leo Strauss and the Politics of Exile: The Making of a Political Philosopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNmPBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT102|year=2014|publisher=Brandeis UP|pages=102–03|isbn=9781611687699}}</ref> In 1939, he served for a short term as a visiting professor at [[Hamilton College]]. He became a U.S. citizen in 1944, and in 1949 became a professor of political science at the [[University of Chicago]], holding the Robert Maynard Hutchins Distinguished Service Professorship until he left in 1969.

In 1953, Strauss coined the phrase ''[[reductio ad Hitlerum]]'', a play on ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', suggesting that comparing an argument to one of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s, or "playing the Nazi card", is often a fallacy of irrelevance.<ref>Leo Strauss, ''Natural Right and History''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965 [1953], p. 42.</ref>

In 1954, he met [[Karl Löwith]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] in [[Heidelberg]] and delivered a public speech on [[Socrates]]. He had received a call for a temporary lectureship in [[Hamburg]] in 1965 (which he declined for health reasons) and received and accepted an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Hamburg]] and the {{Lang|de|[[Bundesverdienstkreuz]]|label=none}} (German Order of Merit) via the German representative in Chicago. In 1969, Strauss moved to [[Claremont McKenna College]] (formerly Claremont Men's College) in California for a year, and then to [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College, Annapolis]] in 1970, where he was the Scott Buchanan Distinguished Scholar in Residence until his death from pneumonia in 1973.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jpl8aokR5ZUC&pg=PA6 Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity: Essays and Lectures in Modernity] preface p. 6.</ref> He was buried in Annapolis Hebrew Cemetery, with his wife Miriam Bernsohn Strauss, who died in 1985. [[Psalm 114]] was read in the funeral service at the request of family and friends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cato1.tripod.com/strauss-bio.htm#_ednref82|title=Leo Strauss|access-date=2020-12-02|archive-date=2021-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210117180702/https://cato1.tripod.com/strauss-bio.htm#_ednref82|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Thought== 
Strauss's thought can be characterized by two main themes: the critique of modernity and the recovery of classical political philosophy. He argued that modernity, which began with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], was a radical break from the tradition of [[Western culture|Western civilization]], and that it led to a crisis of [[nihilism]], [[relativism]], [[historicism]], and [[scientism]]. He claimed that modern political and social sciences, which were based on empirical observation and rational analysis, failed to grasp the essential questions of human nature, morality, and justice, and that they reduced human beings to mere objects of manipulation and calculation. He also criticized modern [[liberalism]], which he saw as a product of modernity, for its lack of moral and spiritual foundations, and for its tendency to undermine the authority of religion, tradition, and [[natural law]].<ref name=Batnizky>[[Leora Batnitzky]], [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/strauss-leo/%20Leo%20Strauss Leo Strauss], the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], 9 April 2021.</ref><ref name=Routledge>[[Shadia Drury]] (1998). [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/biographical/strauss-leo-1899-1973/v-1 Strauss, Leo (1899–1973)]. In The [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]. Taylor and Francis. Retrieved 30 Dec. 2023. doi:10.4324/9780415249126-S092-1</ref>

To overcome the crisis of modernity, Strauss proposed a return to the classical political philosophy of the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greeks]] and the [[Medieval philosophy|medieval thinkers]], who he believed had a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of human nature and society. He advocated a careful and respectful reading of the classical texts, arguing that their authors wrote in an esoteric manner, which he called "[[Persecution and the Art of Writing|the art of writing]]" and which he practiced in his own works. He suggested that the classical authors hid their true teachings behind a surface layer of conventional opinions, in order to avoid persecution and to educate only the few who were capable of grasping them, and that they engaged in a dialogue with each other across the ages. Strauss called this dialogue "[[Great Conversation|the great conversation]]", and invited his readers to join it.<ref name=Batnizky/><ref name=Routledge/>

Strauss's interpretation of the classical political philosophy was influenced by his own Jewish background and his encounter with Islamic and Jewish medieval philosophy, especially the works of [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Maimonides]]. He argued that these philosophers, who lived under the [[Sharia|rule of Islam]], faced similar challenges as the ancient Greeks. He also claimed that these philosophers, who were both faithful to their revealed religions and loyal to the rational pursuit of philosophy, offered a model of how to reconcile [[reason]] and [[revelation]], philosophy and theology, Athens and Jerusalem.<ref name=Batnizky/><ref name=Routledge/>

== Views ==
=== Philosophy ===
For Strauss, politics and philosophy were necessarily intertwined. He regarded the trial and death of [[Socrates]] as the moment when political philosophy came into existence. Strauss considered one of the most important moments in the [[history of philosophy]] Socrates' argument that philosophers could not study [[nature]] without considering their own [[human nature]],<ref>Laurence Lampert, ''The Enduring Importance of Leo Strauss'', University of Chicago Press, 2013, p. 126.</ref> which, in the words of [[Aristotle]], is that of "a political animal."<ref>"From these things it is evident, that the city belongs among the things that exist by nature, and that man is by nature a political animal" (Aristotle, ''The Politics'', 1253a1–3).</ref> However, he also held that the ends of politics and philosophy were inherently irreconcilable and irreducible to one another.<ref>Steven B. Smith, ''Reading Leo Strauss: Politics, Philosophy, Judaism'', University of Chicago Press, 2007, p. 13.</ref><ref>[[Thomas Pangle|Pangle, Thomas L.]], ''Leo Strauss: An Introduction to His Thought and Intellectual Legacy''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 2006, p. 51: "Classical political philosophy is not concerned to rule, but it is concerned to understand, political society—and to share its understanding, in a constructive fashion, with the various political societies and their citizens and rulers."

Cf. also his "Fundamental Tension" (ibid., p.54f) </ref>

Strauss distinguished "scholars" from "great thinkers," identifying himself as a scholar. He wrote that most self-described philosophers are in actuality scholars, cautious and methodical. Great thinkers, in contrast, boldly and creatively address big problems. Scholars deal with these problems only indirectly by reasoning about the great thinkers' differences.<ref>Leo Strauss, "An Introduction to Heideggerian Existentialism," 27–46 in ''The Rebirth of Classical Political Rationalism,'' ed. Thomas L. Pangle (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1989) 29–30.</ref>

In ''Natural Right and History'', Strauss begins with a critique of [[Max Weber]]'s [[epistemology]], briefly engages the [[relativism]] of [[Martin Heidegger]] (who goes unnamed) and continues with a discussion of the evolution of [[natural right]]s via an analysis of the thought of [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]]. He concludes by critiquing [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Edmund Burke]]. At the heart of the book are excerpts from [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Cicero]]. Much of his philosophy is a reaction to the works of [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]. Indeed, Strauss wrote that Heidegger's thinking must be understood and confronted before any complete formulation of modern political theory is possible, and this means that political thought has to engage with issues of ontology and the history of metaphysics.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Velkley |first1=Richard L. |title=[[Heidegger, Strauss, and the premises of philosophy : on original forgetting]] |date=2015 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |isbn=9780226214948 |edition=Paperback 2015}}</ref>

Strauss wrote that [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was the first philosopher to properly understand [[historicism]], an idea grounded in a general acceptance of Hegelian [[philosophy of history]]. Heidegger, in Strauss's view, sanitized and politicized Nietzsche, whereas Nietzsche believed "our own principles, including the belief in progress, will become as unconvincing and alien as all earlier principles (essences) had shown themselves to be" and "the only way out seems to be ... that one voluntarily choose life-giving delusion instead of deadly truth, that one fabricate a myth."<ref>Leo Strauss, "Relativism", 13–26 in ''The Rebirth of Classical Political Rationalism'', ed. Thomas L. Pangle (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), 25.</ref> Heidegger believed that the tragic [[nihilism]] of Nietzsche was itself a "myth" guided by a defective Western conception of [[Being]] that Heidegger traced to Plato. In his published correspondence with [[Alexandre Kojève]], Strauss wrote that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was correct when he postulated that an end of history implies an end to philosophy as understood by classical political philosophy.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/191204 | jstor=191204 | title=Leo Strauss's Classic Natural Right Teaching | last1=Drury | first1=S.

=== On reading ===
[[File:Al-Farabi.jpg|thumb|Strauss's study of philosophy and political discourses produced by the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]—especially those of [[Al-Farabi]] (shown here) and [[Maimonides]]—was instrumental in the development of his theory of reading.]]

In the late 1930s, Strauss called for the first time for a reconsideration of the "distinction between exoteric (or public) and esoteric (or secret) teaching."<ref>"Exoteric Teaching" (Critical Edition by Hannes Kerber). In ''Reorientation: Leo Strauss in the 1930s''. Edited by Martin D. Yaffe and Richard S. Ruderman. New York: Palgrave, 2014, p. 275.</ref> In 1952 he published ''[[Persecution and the Art of Writing]]'', arguing that serious writers write esoterically, that is, with multiple or layered meanings, often disguised within irony or paradox, obscure references, even deliberate self-contradiction. Esoteric writing serves several purposes: protecting the philosopher from the retribution of the regime, and protecting the regime from the corrosion of philosophy; it attracts the right kind of reader and repels the wrong kind; and ferreting out the interior message is in itself an exercise of philosophic reasoning.<ref>{{cite book |author=Smith, Steven |title=Reading Leo Strauss |year=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |quote=excerpt entitled "Why Strauss, Why Now?" |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/764028.html |isbn=978-0226763897 |access-date=2006-09-20 |archive-date=2020-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109031348/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/764028.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Mansfield, Harvey |title=Strauss's Machiavelli |quote= ... a book containing much that is appreciably esoteric to any reader stated in a manner either so elusive or so challenging as to cause him to give up trying to understand it. |work=[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]] |year=1975 |jstor= 190834}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Damon Linker |title=What if Leo Strauss was Right? |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/271006/what-if-leo-strauss-was-right |work=[[The Week]] |date=October 31, 2014 |access-date=2014-11-04 |archive-date=2014-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103102531/http://theweek.com/article/index/271006/what-if-leo-strauss-was-right |url-status=live }}</ref> 

Taking his bearings from his study of [[Maimonides]] and [[Al-Farabi]], and pointing further back to Plato's discussion of writing as contained in the ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', Strauss proposed that the classical and medieval art of ''esoteric'' writing is the proper medium for philosophic learning: rather than displaying philosophers' thoughts superficially, classical and medieval philosophical texts guide their readers in thinking and learning independently of imparted knowledge. Thus, Strauss agrees with the Socrates of the ''Phaedrus'', where the Greek indicates that, insofar as writing does not respond when questioned, good writing provokes questions in the reader—questions that orient the reader towards an understanding of problems the author thought about with utmost seriousness. Strauss thus, in ''Persecution and the Art of Writing'', presents Maimonides "as a closet nonbeliever obfuscating his message for political reasons".<ref>Michael Paley and Jacob J. Staub in ''Jewish Philosophy: Medieval and Modern'', printed in ''The Schocken Guide to Jewish Books'' (1992) p. 215.</ref>

[[Straussian hermeneutics|Strauss's hermeneutical]] argument<ref name="Schröder">Winfried Schröder (ed.), ''Reading between the lines – Leo Strauss and the history of early modern philosophy'', Walter de Gruyter, 2015, p. 39, "According to Robert Hunt, '[t]he Straussian hermeneutic ... sees the course of intellectual history as an ongoing conversation about important philosophical questions'."</ref>—rearticulated throughout his subsequent writings (most notably in ''The City and Man'' [1964])—is that, before the 19th century, Western scholars commonly understood that philosophical writing is not at home in any polity, no matter how liberal. Insofar as it questions conventional wisdom at its roots, philosophy must guard itself especially against those readers who believe themselves authoritative, wise, and liberal defenders of the status quo. In questioning established opinions, or in investigating the principles of morality, philosophers of old found it necessary to convey their messages in an oblique manner. Their "art of writing" was the art of esoteric communication. This was especially apparent in medieval times when heterodox political thinkers wrote under the threat of the [[Inquisition]] or comparably obtuse tribunals.

Strauss's argument is not that the medieval writers he studies reserved one exoteric meaning for the many ([[hoi polloi]]) and an esoteric, hidden one for the few (hoi oligoi), but that, through rhetorical stratagems including self-contradiction and hyperboles, these writers succeeded in conveying their proper meaning at the tacit heart of their writings—a heart or message irreducible to "the letter" or historical dimension of texts.

Explicitly following [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s lead, Strauss indicates that medieval political philosophers, no less than their ancient counterparts, carefully adapted their wording to the dominant moral views of their time, lest their writings be condemned as heretical or unjust, not by "the many" (who did not read), but by those "few" whom the many regarded as the most righteous guardians of morality. It was precisely these righteous personalities who would be most inclined to persecute/ostracize anyone who was in the business of exposing the noble or great lie upon which the authority of the few over the many stands or falls.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ubxOiy1-lpQC&pg=PA25 Jew and Philosopher: The Return to Maimonides in the Jewish Thought of Leo Strauss] p. 25</ref>

=== On politics ===
{{conservatism sidebar|philosophers}}
{{Conservatism US|schools}}
According to Strauss, modern [[social science]] is flawed because it assumes the [[fact–value distinction]], a concept which Strauss found dubious. He traced its roots in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy to [[Max Weber]], a thinker whom Strauss described as a "serious and noble mind". Weber wanted to separate values from science but, according to Strauss, was really a derivative thinker, deeply influenced by Nietzsche's [[relativism]].<ref>[[Allan Bloom]], "Leo Strauss", 235–55 in ''Giants and Dwarfs: Essays 1960–1990'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1990) 238–39.</ref> Strauss treated politics as something that could not be studied from afar. A political scientist examining politics with a value-free scientific eye, for Strauss, was self-deluded. [[Positivism]], the heir to both [[Auguste Comte]] and Max Weber in the quest to make purportedly value-free judgments, failed to justify its own existence, which would require a value judgment.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=In0tFsfFhnQC&pg=PA193 ''Faith and Political Philosophy: The Correspondence Between Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin, 1934–1964''], p. 193</ref>

While modern-era [[Classical liberalism|liberalism]] had stressed the pursuit of individual liberty as its highest goal, Strauss felt that there should be a greater interest in the problem of human excellence and political virtue. Through his writings, Strauss constantly raised the question of how, and to what extent, freedom and excellence can coexist. Strauss refused to make do with any simplistic or one-sided resolutions of the Socratic question: ''What is the [[Good and evil|good]] for the city and man?''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zG2tRJHEdLUC&pg=PA3 ''Political Philosopher and Jewish Thinker''], p. 3</ref>

=== Encounters with Carl Schmitt and Alexandre Kojève ===
Two significant political-philosophical dialogues Strauss had with living thinkers were those he held with [[Carl Schmitt]] and [[Alexandre Kojève]]. Schmitt, who would later become, for a short time, the chief jurist of Nazi Germany, was one of the first important German academics to review Strauss's early work positively. Schmitt's positive reference for, and approval of, Strauss's work on [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] was instrumental in winning Strauss the scholarship funding that allowed him to leave Germany.<ref>''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: the hidden dialogue'', [[Heinrich Meier]], University of Chicago Press 1995, 123</ref>

Strauss's critique and clarifications of ''[[The Concept of the Political]]'' led Schmitt to make significant emendations in its second edition. Writing to Schmitt in 1932, Strauss summarised Schmitt's [[political theology]] that "because man is by nature evil, he, therefore, needs '' dominion''. But dominion can be established, that is, men can be unified only in a unity against—against other men. Every association of men is necessarily a separation from other men ... the political thus understood is not the constitutive principle of the state, of order, but a condition of the state."<ref>''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: the hidden dialogue'', Heinrich Meier, University of Chicago Press 1995, 125</ref>

Strauss, however, directly opposed Schmitt's position. For Strauss, Schmitt and his return to [[Thomas Hobbes]] helpfully clarified the nature of our political existence and our modern self-understanding. Schmitt's position was therefore symptomatic of the modern-era [[Classical liberalism|liberal]] self-understanding. Strauss believed that such an analysis, as in Hobbes's time, served as a useful "preparatory action," revealing our contemporary orientation towards the eternal problems of politics (social existence). However, Strauss believed that Schmitt's reification of our modern self-understanding of the problem of politics into a political theology was not an adequate solution. Strauss instead advocated a return to a broader classical understanding of human nature and a tentative return to political philosophy, in the tradition of the ancient philosophers.<ref>''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: the hidden dialogue'', Heinrich Meier, University of Chicago Press 1995</ref>

With Kojève, Strauss had a close and lifelong philosophical friendship. They had first met as students in Berlin. The two thinkers shared boundless philosophical respect for each other. Kojève would later write that, without befriending Strauss, "I never would have known ... what philosophy is".<ref>{{citation |last=Lilla |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Lilla |chapter=Alexandre Kojève |title=The Reckless Mind. Intellectuals in Politics |year=2001 |publisher=New York Review Books |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780940322769/page/131 131] |isbn=978-0-940322-76-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780940322769/page/131 }}.</ref> The political-philosophical dispute between Kojève and Strauss centered on the role that philosophy should and can be allowed to play in politics.

Kojève, a senior civil servant in the French government, was instrumental in the creation of the [[European Economic Community]]. He argued that philosophers should have an active role in shaping political events. Strauss, on the contrary, believed that philosophers should play a role in politics only to the extent that they can ensure that philosophy, which he saw as mankind's highest activity, can be free from political intervention.<ref>{{citation | last = Strauss | first = Leo | title = On Tyranny | editor-last = Gourevitch | editor-first = Victor | editor2-last = Roth | editor2-first = Michael S.}}</ref>

=== Liberalism and nihilism ===
Strauss argued that [[Classical liberalism|liberalism]] in its modern form (which is oriented toward [[Liberty|universal freedom]] as opposed to "ancient liberalism" which is oriented toward [[Virtue ethics|human excellence]]), contained within it an intrinsic tendency towards extreme [[relativism]], which in turn led to two types of [[nihilism]]:<ref>Thomas L. Pangle, "Epilogue", 907–38 in ''History of Political Philosophy'', ed. Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, 3rd ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987) 907–8.</ref>

* The first was a "brutal" nihilism, expressed in [[Nazi]] and [[Bolshevik]] regimes. In ''On Tyranny'', he wrote that these [[ideologies]], both descendants of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, tried to destroy all traditions, history, ethics, and moral standards and replace them by force under which nature and mankind are subjugated and conquered.<ref>Leo Strauss, ''On Tyranny'' (New York: Free Press, 1991) 22–23, 178.</ref>
* The second type—the "gentle" nihilism expressed in Western [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]—was a kind of value-free aimlessness and a [[hedonism|hedonistic]] "permissive [[egalitarianism]]," which he saw as permeating the fabric of contemporary American society.<ref>Leo Strauss, "The Crisis of Our Time", 41–54 in Howard Spaeth, ed., ''The Predicament of Modern Politics'' (Detroit: University of Detroit Press, 1964) 47–48.</ref><ref>Leo Strauss, "What Is Political Philosophy?" 9–55 in Leo Strauss, ''What Is Political Philosophy? and Other Studies'' (Glencoe, IL: The Free Press, 1959) 18–19.</ref>

In the belief that 20th-century relativism, [[scientism]], [[historicism]], and nihilism were all implicated in the deterioration of [[modernism|modern society]] and philosophy, Strauss sought to uncover the philosophical pathways that had led to this situation. The resultant study led him to advocate a tentative return to classical political philosophy as a starting point for judging political action.<ref>Leo Strauss, ''The City and Man'' (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1964) 10–11.</ref>

=== Strauss's interpretation of Plato's ''Republic'' ===
According to Strauss, the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' by [[Plato]] is not "a blueprint for regime reform" (a play on words from [[Karl Popper]]'s ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', which attacks ''The Republic'' for being just that). Strauss quotes [[Cicero]]: "''The Republic'' does not bring to light the best possible regime but rather the nature of political things—the nature of the city."<ref>Leo Strauss, "Plato", 33–89 in ''History of Political Philosophy'', ed. Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, 3rd ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987) 68.</ref>

Strauss argued that the city-in-speech was unnatural, precisely because "it is rendered possible by the abstraction from ''eros''".<ref>Leo Strauss, "Plato", 33–89 in ''History of Political Philosophy'', ed. Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, 3rd ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987) 60.</ref> Though skeptical of "progress," Strauss was equally skeptical about political agendas of "return"—that is, going backward instead of forward.

In fact, he was consistently suspicious of anything claiming to be a solution to an old political or philosophical problem. He spoke of the danger in trying finally to resolve the debate between [[rationalism]] and [[tradition]]alism in politics. In particular, along with many in the [[Weimar Republic|pre-World War&nbsp;II]] German Right, he feared people trying to force a [[world state]] to come into being in the future, thinking that it would inevitably become a [[tyranny]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=puxRXDxS5TMC ''On Tyranny''], p. 143</ref> Hence he kept his distance from the two totalitarianisms that he denounced in his century, both fascists and communists.

=== Strauss and Karl Popper ===
Strauss actively rejected [[Karl Popper]]'s views as illogical. He agreed with a letter of response to his request of [[Eric Voegelin]] to look into the issue. In the response, Voegelin wrote that studying Popper's views was a waste of precious time, and "an annoyance". Specifically about ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' and Popper's understanding of Plato's ''The Republic'', after giving some examples, Voegelin wrote:

{{blockquote|Popper is philosophically so uncultured, so fully a primitive ideological brawler, that he is not able even approximately to reproduce correctly the contents of one page of Plato. Reading is of no use to him; he is too lacking in knowledge to understand what the author says.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Voegelin, Eric |author2=Strauss, Leo |editor1-last=Emberley |editor1-first=Peter |editor2-last=Cooper |editor2-first=Barry |title=Faith and Political Philosophy: The Correspondence between Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin, 1934-1964 |date=20 August 2004 |publisher=University of Missouri |isbn=978-0826215512 |page=68 |chapter=Letter 30: April 18, 1950}}</ref>}}

Strauss proceeded to show this letter to [[Kurt Riezler]], who used his influence in order to oppose Popper's appointment at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Anonymous |title=Strauss and Voegelin on Popper |url=http://thephilosophyofscience.wordpress.com/2011/07/15/strauss-and-voegelin-on-popper/ |website=Philosophy of Science |access-date=4 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728053558/http://thephilosophyofscience.wordpress.com/2011/07/15/strauss-and-voegelin-on-popper/ |archive-date=2013-07-28 |date=2011-07-15}}</ref>

=== Ancients and Moderns ===
Strauss constantly stressed the importance of two dichotomies in political philosophy, namely [[Athens]] and [[Jerusalem]] ([[reason]] and [[revelation]]) and Ancient versus Modern. The "Ancients" were the Socratic philosophers and their intellectual heirs; the "Moderns" start with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. The contrast between Ancients and Moderns was understood to be related to the unresolvable tension between Reason and Revelation. The Socratics, reacting to the first [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers, brought philosophy back to earth, and hence back to the marketplace, making it more political.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0AUpAMhf8OAC&pg=PA104 Leo Strauss, the Straussians, and the American Regime]'' by Kenneth Deutch (1999), p. 104</ref>

The Moderns reacted to the dominance of revelation in [[medieval]] society by promoting the possibilities of Reason. They objected to Aquinas's merger of natural right and [[natural theology]], for it made natural right vulnerable to sideshow theological disputes.<ref>Strauss, Leo, ''Natural Right and History'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1953) p. 164</ref> [[Thomas Hobbes]], under the influence of [[Francis Bacon]], re-oriented political thought to what was most solid but also most low in man—his physical hopes and fears—setting a precedent for [[John Locke]] and the later economic approach to political thought, as in [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=X9iWFmynOUEC&pg=PA204 Adam Smith in His Time and Ours: Designing the Decent Society] By Jerry Z. Müller</ref>

=== Strauss and Zionism ===
As a youth, Strauss belonged to the German [[Zionism|Zionist]] youth group, along with his friends [[Gershom Scholem]] and [[Walter Benjamin]]. Both were admirers of Strauss and would continue to be throughout their lives.<ref name="Kenneth Hart Green p. 55">''Jewish philosophy and the crisis of modernity'' (SUNY 1997), ''Leo Strauss as a Modern Jewish thinker'', Kenneth Hart Green, Leo Strauss, p. 55</ref> When he was 17, as he said, he was "converted" to political Zionism as a follower of [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]]. He wrote several essays about its controversies but left these activities behind by his early twenties.<ref>Green, K. H. (editor), Strauss, Leo, ''Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity : Essays and Lectures in Modern Jewish Thought'', 1997, State University of New York Press, p. 3</ref>

While Strauss maintained a sympathetic interest in Zionism, he later came to refer to Zionism as "problematic" and became disillusioned with some of its aims.

He taught at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] during the 1954–55 [[academic year]]. In his letter to a ''[[National Review]]'' editor, Strauss asked why [[Israel]] had been called a [[racist]] state by one of their writers. He argued that the author did not provide enough proof for his argument. He ended his essay with this statement: "Political Zionism is problematic for obvious reasons. But I can never forget what it achieved as a moral force in an era of complete dissolution. It helped to stem the tide of 'progressive' leveling of venerable, ancestral differences; it fulfilled a conservative function."<ref>Green, K. H. (editor), Strauss, L., ''Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity : Essays and Lectures in Modern Jewish Thought'', 1997, State University of New York Press, pp. 413–14</ref>

=== Religious belief ===
Although Strauss accepted the utility of religious belief, there is some question about his religious views. He was openly disdainful of atheism<ref>see his writings on Max Weber</ref>{{better source needed|date=August 2021}} and disapproved of contemporary [[dogma]]tic disbelief, which he considered intemperate and irrational.<ref>Strauss felt that one should either be "the philosopher open to the challenge of theology or the theologian open to the challenge of philosophy." see Deutsch, Kenneth L. and Walter Nicgorski [https://books.google.com/books?id=zG2tRJHEdLUC Leo Strauss: Political Philosopher and Jewish Thinker] pp. 11–12, 1994 Rowman & Littlefield</ref> However, like [[Thomas Aquinas]], he felt that revelation must be subject to examination by reason.<ref>but where Aquinas saw an amicable interplay between reason and revelation, Strauss saw two impregnable fortresses. per Schall S.J., James V. ''A Latitude for Statesmanship: Strauss on St. Thomas'' in [https://books.google.com/books?id=zG2tRJHEdLUC Leo Strauss: Political Philosopher and Jewish Thinker], ed. Kenneth L. Deutsch and Walter Nicgorski, pp. 212–15, 1994 Rowman & Littlefield. For an early treatment of Aquinas' understanding of the relation between philosophy and sacred, revealed law, see Strauss's early ''Philosophy and Law'' (''Philosophie und Gesetz''), where Christian medieval theology testifies to a less than amicable opposition between pagan (though not necessarily Platonic or political) philosophy and Biblical morality.</ref> At the end of ''The City and Man'', Strauss invites us to "be open to ... the question ''quid sit deus'' ["What is God?"]" (p.&nbsp;241). [[Edward Feser]] writes that "Strauss was not himself an orthodox believer, neither was he a convinced [[atheist]]. Since whether or not to accept a purported divine revelation is itself one of the 'permanent' questions, orthodoxy must always remain an option equally as defensible as unbelief."<ref>Feser, Edward, [http://nrd.nationalreview.com/article/?q=NzE5MTRlZGY5YmY1MTUyOTZkYWY5NThmZGQ2NTNjOTU= "Leo Strauss 101"] (a review of Steven B. Smith's ''Reading Leo Strauss: Politics, Philosophy, Judaism''), ''National Review Online,'' May 22, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115105641/http://nrd.nationalreview.com/article/?q=NzE5MTRlZGY5YmY1MTUyOTZkYWY5NThmZGQ2NTNjOTU= |date=November 15, 2006 }}</ref>

In ''Natural Right and History'', Strauss distinguishes a Socratic (Platonic, Ciceronian, Aristotelian) from a conventionalist (materialistic, Epicurean) reading of divinity, and argues that "the question of religion" (what is religion?) is inseparable from the question of the nature of civil society and civil authority. Throughout the volume he argues for the Socratic reading of civil authority and rejects the conventionalist reading (of which atheism is an essential component).<ref>See ''Natural Right and History'', especially p. 119A and Chapter III: "The Origin of the Idea of Natural Right"</ref> This is incompatible with interpretations by Shadia Drury and other scholars who argue that Strauss viewed religion purely instrumentally.<ref>Shadia B. Drury, ''Leo Strauss and the American Right'' (Palgrave Macmillan; 1999)</ref><ref>Peter Minowitz, ''Straussophobia: Defending Leo Strauss and Straussians against Shadia Drury and Other Accusers'' (Lexington Books; 2009)</ref>

== Reception and legacy ==
=== Reception by contemporaries ===
Strauss's works were read and admired by thinkers as diverse as the philosophers [[Gershom Scholem]], [[Walter Benjamin]],<ref name="Kenneth Hart Green p. 55"/> [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]],<ref name="Political Thought 2009 page 56"/> and [[Alexandre Kojève]],<ref name="Political Thought 2009 page 56"/> and the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]].<ref name="Political Thought 2009 page 56">''Approaches to Political Thought'', edited by William L. Richter, (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 16 Mar 2009), p. 56</ref> Benjamin had become acquainted with Strauss as a student in Berlin, and expressed admiration for Strauss throughout his life.<ref name="Kenneth Hart Green page 55"/><ref name="Scholem, Gershom 1981. page 201"/><ref name="Gershom Scholem 1989, page 155-58"/> Gadamer stated that he 'largely agreed' with Strauss's interpretations.<ref name="Political Thought 2009 page 56"/>

=== The Straussian school ===
Straussianism is the name given "to denote the research methods, common concepts, theoretical presuppositions, central questions, and pedagogic style (teaching style<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pedagogic|title=Definition of PEDAGOGIC|access-date=2020-12-26|archive-date=2020-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022033042/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pedagogic|url-status=live}}</ref>) characteristic of the large number of conservatives who have been influenced by the thought and teaching of Leo Strauss".<ref name=First>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=871|title=Straussianism|author=Mark C. Henrie|date=May 5, 2011|publisher=First Principles – ISI Web Journal|access-date=November 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221125446/http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=871|archive-date=December 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> While it "is particularly influential among university professors of historical political theory ... it also sometimes serves as a common intellectual framework more generally among conservative activists, think tank professionals, and public intellectuals".<ref name=First/> [[Harvey Mansfield|Harvey C. Mansfield]], [[Steven B. Smith (professor)|Steven B. Smith]] and Steven Berg, though never students of Strauss, are "Straussians" (as some followers of Strauss identify themselves). Mansfield has argued that there is no such thing as "Straussianism" yet there are Straussians and a school of Straussians. Mansfield describes the school as "open to the whole of philosophy" and without any definite doctrines that one has to believe in order to belong to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/transcript/harvey-mansfield-iv-transcript/|title=Transcript of Harvey Mansfield (IV)|website=conversationswithbillkristol.org|access-date=14 March 2018|archive-date=15 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315134211/http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/transcript/harvey-mansfield-iv-transcript/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Within the discipline of political theory, the method calls for its practitioners to use "a 'close reading' of the 'Great Books' of political thought; they strive to understand a thinker 'as he understood himself'; they are unconcerned with questions about the historical context of, or historical influences on, a given author"<ref name=First/> and strive to be open to the idea that they may find something timelessly true in a [[great book]]. The approach "resembles in important ways the old [[New Criticism]] in literary studies."<ref name=First/> 

There is some controversy in the approach over what distinguishes a great book from lesser works. Great books are held to be written by authors/philosophers "of such sovereign critical self-knowledge and intellectual power that they can in no way be reduced to the general thought of their time and place,"<ref name=First/> with other works "understood as epiphenomenal to the original insights of a thinker of the first rank."<ref name=First/> This approach is seen as a counter "to the historicist presuppositions of the mid-twentieth century, which read the history of political thought in a progressivist way, with past philosophies forever cut off from us in a superseded past."<ref name=First/> Straussianism puts forward the possibility that past thinkers may have "hold of ''the truth''{{mdash}}and that more recent thinkers are therefore wrong."<ref name=First/>

=== The Chinese Straussians ===
Almost the entirety of Strauss's writings has been translated into Chinese. There even is a school of Straussians in China, the most prominent being [[Liu Xiaofeng (academic)|Liu Xiaofeng]] (Renmin University) and [[Gan Yang]]. "Chinese Straussians" (who often are also fascinated by Carl Schmitt) represent an example of the hybridization of Western political theory in a non-Western context. As the editors of a recent volume write, "the reception of Schmitt and Strauss in the Chinese-speaking world (and especially in the People's Republic of China) not only says much about how Schmitt and Strauss can be read today, but also provides important clues about the deeper contradictions of Western modernity and the dilemmas of non-liberal societies in our increasingly contentious world."<ref>{{cite book|last=Marchal|first=Kai|title=Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss in the Chinese-speaking World: Reorienting the Political|year=2017|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-1498536264|page=7}}.</ref>

== Criticism ==

=== Basis for esotericism ===
In the essay, ''Persecution and the Art of Writing'', Strauss posits that information needs to be kept secret from the masses by "writing between the lines". However, this seems like a false premise, as most authors Strauss refers to in his work lived in times when only the social elites were literate enough to understand works of philosophy.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bekesi |first=Aron B |date=2019-12-31 |title=Esoteric philosophy: Leo Strauss and sociolinguistics |url=https://doi.org/10.23756/sp.v7i2.481 |journal=Science & Philosophy |volume=7 |issue=2 |doi=10.23756/sp.v7i2.481}}</ref>

=== Conservatism ===
Some critics of Strauss have accused him of being [[elitism|elitist]], [[illiberalism|illiberal]] and anti-democratic. Journalists such as [[Seymour Hersh]] have opined that Strauss endorsed [[noble lie]]s, "myths used by political leaders seeking to maintain a cohesive society".<ref name=Hersh>[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M. Hersh]], [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/05/12/030512fa_fact "Selective Intelligence"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717100914/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/05/12/030512fa_fact |date=2014-07-17 }}, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', May 12, 2003.

Retrieved February 16, 2007.</ref> In ''The City and Man'', Strauss discusses the myths outlined in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' that are required for all governments. These include a belief that the state's land belongs to it even though it may have been acquired illegitimately and that citizenship is rooted in something more than accidents of birth.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=y-xnGhgrwUoC ''The City and Man''], p. 104</ref>

[[Shadia Drury]], in ''Leo Strauss and the American Right'' (1999), claimed that Strauss [[inculcation|inculcated]] an elitist strain in American political leaders linked to [[imperialism|imperialist]] [[militarism]], [[neoconservatism]] and [[Christian fundamentalism]]. Drury argues that Strauss teaches that "[[Noble lie|perpetual deception of the citizens by those in power is critical because they need to be led]], and they need strong rulers to tell them what's good for them". Nicholas Xenos similarly argues that Strauss was "an anti-democrat in a fundamental sense, a true [[reactionary]]". Xenos says: "Strauss was somebody who wanted to go back to a previous, pre-liberal, pre-[[bourgeois]] era of blood and guts, of imperial domination, of authoritarian rule, of pure [[fascism]]."<ref name="Xenos_Logos">Nicholas Xenos, [http://www.logosjournal.com/xenos.htm "Leo Strauss and the Rhetoric of the War on Terror,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126074218/http://www.logosjournal.com/xenos.htm |date=2021-01-26 }} ''Logosjournal.com''</ref>

=== Anti-historicism ===
Strauss has also been criticized by some [[conservatives]]. According to [[Claes G. Ryn]], Strauss's anti-historicist thinking creates an artificial contrast between moral universality and "the conventional", "the ancestral", and "the historical". Strauss, Ryn argues, wrongly and reductively assumes that respect for tradition must undermine reason and universality. Contrary to Strauss's criticism of Edmund Burke, the historical sense may be indispensable to an adequate apprehension of universality. Strauss's abstract, ahistorical conception of natural right distorts genuine universality, Ryn contends. Strauss does not consider the possibility that real universality becomes known to human beings in a concretized, particular form. Strauss and the Straussians have paradoxically taught philosophically unsuspecting American conservatives, not least Roman Catholic intellectuals, to reject tradition in favor of ahistorical theorizing, a bias that flies in the face of the central Christian notion of the Incarnation, which represents a synthesis of the universal and the historical. According to Ryn, the propagation of a purely abstract idea of universality has contributed to the neoconservative advocacy of allegedly universal American principles, which neoconservatives see as justification for American intervention around the world—bringing the blessings of the "West" to the benighted "rest". Strauss's anti-historical thinking connects him and his followers with the French [[Jacobins]], who also regarded tradition as incompatible with virtue and rationality.<ref>Claes G. Ryn, "Leo Strauss and History: The Philosopher as Conspirator", ''Humanitas'', Vol. XVIII, Nos. 1 & 2 (2005).</ref> 

What Ryn calls the "new Jacobinism" of the "neoconservative" philosophy is, writes [[Paul Gottfried]], also the rhetoric of [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] and [[Leon Trotsky]], which the philosophically impoverished American Right has taken over with mindless alacrity; [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] operators and [[think tank]]s apparently believe they can carry the electorate by appealing to yesterday's [[leftist]] clichés.<ref name=Gottfried>Paul Gottfried, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/gottfried/gottfried90.html "Strauss and the Straussians"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618055415/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/gottfried/gottfried90.html |date=2015-06-18 }}, ''LewRockwell.com'', April 17, 2006.

=== Response to criticism ===
In his 2009 book ''Straussophobia'', Peter Minowitz provides a detailed critique of Drury, Xenos, and other critics of Strauss whom he accuses of "bigotry and buffoonery".<ref>Peter Minowitz, ''Straussophobia: Defending Leo Strauss and Straussians against Shadia Drury and Other Accusers'' (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2009).

In ''Reading Leo Strauss'', [[Steven B. Smith (professor)|Steven B. Smith]] rejects the link between Strauss and [[neoconservative]] thought, arguing that Strauss was never personally active in politics, never endorsed imperialism, and questioned the utility of political philosophy for the practice of politics. In particular, Strauss argued that Plato's myth of the [[philosopher king]] should be read as a [[reductio ad absurdum]], and that philosophers should understand politics not in order to influence policy but to ensure philosophy's autonomy from politics.<ref name=SSmith>[[Steven B.

Strauss's daughter, [[Jenny Strauss Clay]], defended Strauss against the charge that he was the "mastermind behind the neoconservative ideologues who control United States foreign policy." "He was a conservative", she says, "insofar as he did not think change is necessarily change for the better." Since contemporary academia "leaned to the left", with its "unquestioned faith in progress and science combined with a queasiness regarding any kind of moral judgment", Strauss stood outside of the academic consensus. Had academia leaned to the right, he would have questioned it, too{{mdash}}and on certain occasions ''did'' question the tenets of the right.<ref name="MyUser_The_New_York_Times_March_30_2015c">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/07/opinion/07CLAY.html |title=The Real Leo Strauss |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 7, 2003 |author=Jenny Strauss Clay |access-date=March 30, 2015 |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121914/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/07/opinion/07CLAY.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Mark Lilla]] has argued that the attribution to Strauss of neoconservative views contradicts a careful reading of Strauss' actual texts, in particular ''On Tyranny''. Lilla summarizes Strauss as follows:

<blockquote>Philosophy must always be aware of the dangers of tyranny, as a threat to both political decency and the philosophical life. It must understand enough about politics to defend its own autonomy, without falling into the error of thinking that philosophy can shape the political world according to its own lights.<ref>Mark Lilla, ''The Reckless Mind'' (New York: NY Review of Books, 2001) 133.</ref></blockquote>

Responding to charges that Strauss's teachings fostered the neoconservative foreign policy of the [[George W. Bush]] administration, such as "unrealistic hopes for the spread of liberal democracy through military conquest", Nathan Tarcov, director of the Leo Strauss Center at the University of Chicago, asserts that Strauss as a political philosopher was essentially non-political. After an exegesis of the very limited practical political views to be gleaned from Strauss's writings, Tarcov concludes that "Strauss can remind us of the permanent problems, but we have only ourselves to blame for our faulty solutions to the problems of today."<ref>Nathan Tarcov, "Will the Real Leo Strauss Please Stand Up" in ''The American Interest'' September–October 1986, at {{cite web |url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=166 |title=Will the Real Leo Strauss Please Stand Up? - Nathan Tarcov - the American Interest Magazine |access-date=2009-06-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130050901/http://the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=166 |archive-date=2010-11-30 }}</ref>
