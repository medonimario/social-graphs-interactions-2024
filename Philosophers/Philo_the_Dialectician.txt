'''Philo the Dialectician''' ({{langx|el|Φίλων}}; [[floruit|fl.]] 300 BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] philosopher of the [[Megarian school|Megarian (Dialectical) school]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Philo the Dialectician (late 4th–early 3rd centuries BC) - Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/biographical/philo-the-dialectician-late-4th-early-3rd-centuries-bc/v-1|access-date=2021-09-11|website=www.rep.routledge.com|language=en}}</ref> He is sometimes called '''Philo of Megara''' although the city of his birth is unknown. He is most famous for the debate he had with his teacher [[Diodorus Cronus]] concerning the idea of the [[Subjunctive possibility|possible]] and the criteria of the truth of [[material conditional|conditional statements]].

==Life==
Little is known about the life of Philo. He was a disciple of [[Diodorus Cronus]], and was a friend of [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], the founder of [[Stoicism]]. [[Diogenes Laërtius]] states that Zeno "used to dispute very carefully with Philo the logician and study along with him—hence Zeno, who was the junior, had as great an admiration for Philo as his master Diodorus."<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 16</ref>

[[Jerome]] refers to Philo as the teacher of [[Carneades]], which is chronologically impossible.<ref>Jerome, ''Contra Jovinianum'', i. 42</ref> Diogenes Laërtius mentions a (presumably different) Philo who was a disciple of [[Pyrrho]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 67, 69</ref>

==Writings==
One of Philo's works was called ''Menexenus'' in which he mentioned the five daughters of Diodorus who were all distinguished dialecticians.<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromata'', iv. 19; cf. Jerome, ''Contra Jovinianum'', i. 42</ref> Two of [[Chrysippus]]' logical works were responses to books by Philo, one was directed at "Philo's Work on Meanings",<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 191</ref> and the other at "Philo's Work on Moods".<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 194</ref>

==Philosophy==
Philo disputed with Diodorus respecting the idea of the [[Subjunctive possibility|possible]] and the criteria of the truth of [[material conditional|conditional statements]].

In regards to things possible, Diodorus maintained that possible was identical with necessary, i.e. that possible is "that which either is or will be true".<ref name="ancientlogic">{{cite SEP|url-id=logic-ancient|title=Ancient Logic|last=Bobzien|first=Susanne}}</ref> Philo instead defined possible as "that which is capable of being true by the proposition's own nature",<ref name="ancientlogic"/> thus a statement like "this piece of wood can burn" is possible, even if it spent its entire existence on the bottom of the ocean.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''Nat. Qual.'' i. 14., ''In An. Pr.'' 183-4</ref>

Both Philo and Diodorus sought for criteria for the correct form of conditional propositions, and each of them did so in a manner corresponding to what he maintained respecting the idea of the possible. Philo regarded a conditional as true unless it has both a true [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and a false [[consequent]]. Precisely, let ''T<sub>0</sub>'' and ''T<sub>1</sub>'' be true statements, and let ''F<sub>0</sub>'' and ''F<sub>1</sub>'' be false statements; then, according to Philo, each of the following conditionals is a true statement, because it is not the case that the consequent is false while the antecedent is true (it is not the case that a false statement is asserted to follow from a true statement):
* If ''T<sub>0</sub>'', then ''T<sub>1</sub>''
* If ''F<sub>0</sub>'', then ''T<sub>0</sub>''
* If ''F<sub>0</sub>'', then ''F<sub>1</sub>''
The following conditional does not meet this requirement, and is therefore a false statement according to Philo:
* If ''T<sub>0</sub>, then ''F<sub>0</sub>''
Indeed, [[Sextus Empiricus|Sextus]] says "According to &#91;Philo&#93;, there are three ways in which a conditional may be true, and one in which it may be false."<ref name=sextus-adv-math>Sextus Empiricus, ''Adv. Math.'' viii, Section 113</ref> Philo's criterion of truth is what would now be called a [[truth-functional]] definition of "if ... then"; it is the definition used in [[predicate logic|modern logic]].

In contrast, Diodorus allowed the validity of conditionals only when the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion.<ref name=sextus-adv-math /><ref>Sextus Empiricus, ''Hypotyp.'' ii. 110, comp.</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 47, ''de Fato'', 6.</ref> A century later, the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Chrysippus]] attacked the assumptions of both Philo and Diodorus.
