== Life and Writings ==

Very little is known of the life of John of Mirecourt, but it seems that he was born at Mirecourt in Lorraine between 1310 and 1315.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Neste|first=Roy|title=The Epistemology of John of Mirecourt in Relation to Fourteenth Century Thought|year=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin|pages=14}}</ref> He lectured at the Cistercian College of St. Bernard in Paris, and rose to the height of his philosophical and theological fame around the year 1345.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pasnau|first=Robert|title=The Cambridge History of Medieval Philosophy|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=909}}</ref> He is credited with writing a commentary on Peter Lombard's [[Sentences]], and two subsequent apologies which were responses to various criticisms of his commentary.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Neste|first=Roy|title=The Epistemology of John of Mirecourt in Relation to Fourteenth Century Thought|year=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin|pages=22}}</ref> He wrote two versions of his commentary; the first of which was attacked by a Benedictine called Johannes Normanus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beuchot|first=Mauricio|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=377}}</ref> Mirecourt replied by issuing a ''Declaratio'' in which he explained the meanings behind his propositions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beuchot|first=Mauricio|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=377}}</ref> Nevertheless, acting upon the recommendation of the faculty of theology at the University of Paris, Robert of Bardis, the University chancellor, condemned 41 propositions that were drawn from Mirecourt's writings on the Sentences.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Neste|first=Roy|title=The Epistemology of John of Mirecourt in Relation to Fourteenth Century Thought|year=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin|pages=18}}</ref> Mirecourt responded to this condemnation by writing a second apology to no avail: he was censured in Paris by [[Pope Clement VI]] in 1347.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beuchot|first=Mauricio|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=377}}</ref> After this censure, nothing further is known of him, including any approximation as to the date of his death.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Courtenay|title=nquiry and Inquisition: Academic Freedom in Medieval Universities|journal=Church History |year=1989|volume=2|issue=58|pages=168–181|doi=10.2307/3168722 |jstor=3168722|s2cid=162299569 }}</ref> There is some speculation that scholarly jealousy and academic politics made up a portion of the motivation behind Mirecourt's censure; and as Mirecourt was not radical in all of his philosophical views, it is not unsubstantiated that his censure was in part the result of some ill-will from various of the nominalist factions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Neste|first=Roy|title=The Epistemology of John of Mirecourt in Relation to Fourteenth Century Thought|year=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin|pages=33}}</ref>

=== Philosophical thought ===

==== Knowledge and Intuition ====
 

Mirecourt reasoned that there are two kinds of certain knowledge: (1) 'the principle of non-contradiction,' and (2) 'the immediate intuition of one's existence'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beuchot|first=Mauricio|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=377–379}}</ref> The most undoubtedly of all things that can be known fall to this first kind of knowledge, as well as all analytic judgements that are reducible to it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beuchot|first=Mauricio|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=377–379}}</ref> Mirecourt distinguishes between two kinds of evidence of these kinds of knowledge: (1) special and (2) natural.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beuchot|first=Mauricio|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=377–379}}</ref> Special evidence comes from the principle of non-contradiction, and natural evidence is that which is gained empirically.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beuchot|first=Mauricio|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=377–379}}</ref> Mirecourt thought natural evidence to be weaker than special evidence because he understood God to be both absolutely powerful and the producer of miracles (as taken to be some occurrence outside of what is otherwise empirically observable).<ref>{{cite book|last=Beuchot|first=Mauricio|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=378}}</ref> 

It is speculated that Mirecourt was censured due to his rigid views regarding the reliance of everything upon the will of God.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beuchot|first=Mauricio|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=379}}</ref> Mirecourt held the view that anything physical or moral is wholly depended on the entirely free will of God.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beuchot|first=Mauricio|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=379}}</ref> This was a controversial view because it held God responsible for willing not only all that is good, but also all that is not good. This stood in rather severe contradistinction to the commonly accepted view of Mirecourt's contemporaries which were centered on the premise of an all-good God.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beuchot|first=Mauricio|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=380}}</ref> Mirecourt stated that some temptations cannot be overcome without a miracle from God. Such temptations included resisting the urge to have sexual relations with another man's wife. If this miracle is not given, Mirecourt argued that the action is then to be called neither adultery, nor a sin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beuchot|first=Mauricio|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=380}}</ref>

Mirecourt is most well known for his theories on the infinite.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murdoch|first=John|title=Subtilitates Anglicanae in Fourteenth-Century Paris: John of Mirecourt and Peter Ceffons|year=1978|publisher=New York Academy of Sciences|pages=51–61}}</ref> He was chiefly concerned with species and perfections.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murdoch|first=John|title=Subtilitates Anglicanae in Fourteenth-Century Paris: John of Mirecourt and Peter Ceffons|year=1978|publisher=New York Academy of Sciences|pages=60}}</ref> God possessed the highest degree of perfection on his scale; and all creatures were  infinitely distant from him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murdoch|first=John|title=Subtilitates Anglicanae in Fourteenth-Century Paris: John of Mirecourt and Peter Ceffons|year=1978|publisher=New York Academy of Sciences|pages=60}}</ref> Mirecourt held that it is impossible to measure perfections because of the infinite distance they have from God. Thus, all that can be known is that any species either exceeds, or is exceeded by, some other species in a scale of perfections.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murdoch|first=John|title=Subtilitates Anglicanae in Fourteenth-Century Paris: John of Mirecourt and Peter Ceffons|year=1978|publisher=New York Academy of Sciences|location=New York|pages=60}}</ref>

==== Nominalism ====

Mirecourt is generally thought to be a [[nominalist]], and is often thought of as being a follower of William Ockham. Mirecourt rejected the idea of an imperfect intuitive cognition, however, which is a considerable departure from Ockham.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Neste|first=Roy|title=The Epistemology of John of Mirecourt in Relation to Fourteenth Century Thought|year=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin|pages=90}}</ref> The two, though, are generally in accord, especially with respect to their epistemological views.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Neste|first=Roy|title=The Epistemology of John of Mirecourt in Relation to Fourteenth Century Thought|year=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin|pages=90–91}}</ref>

==== Epistemology ====

Both Mirecourt and Ockham describe abstractive and intuitive cognition in very similar ways: both men think of knowledge as starting with intuitive cognition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Neste|first=Roy|title=The Epistemology of John of Mirecourt in Relation to Fourteenth Century Thought|year=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin|pages=90}}</ref> Both men also distinguish between judgement and simple apprehension.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Neste|first=Roy|title=The Epistemology of John of Mirecourt in Relation to Fourteenth Century Thought|year=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin|pages=90}}</ref> In addition, both assert a need for close connections between a cognition and its object.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Neste|first=Roy|title=The Epistemology of John of Mirecourt in Relation to Fourteenth Century Thought|year=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin|pages=90}}</ref>

==== Influences ====
 
Mirecourt was chiefly influenced by the philosophy of [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]], [[William Ockham]], and to a minimal degree, [[Gregory of Rimini]], and perhaps even [[Thomas Bradwardine]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Neste|first=Roy|title=The Epistemology of John of Mirecourt in Relation to Fourteenth Century Thought|year=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin|pages=14–90}}</ref> Nearly all of the major figures of Mirecourt's day accepted the basic tenets of nominalism, to some degree, and Mirecourt was no different in this respect. He was particularly influenced by the radical nominalist views of Nicholaus of Autrecourt, who was forced to burn his writings in 1347.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Neste|first=Roy|title=The Epistemology of John of Mirecourt in Relation to Fourteenth Century Thought|year=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin|pages=18}}</ref>
