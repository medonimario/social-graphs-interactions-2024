==Biography==
The son of a trained weaver who became a textile designer, Feigl was born in [[Liberec|Reichenberg (Liberec)]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], into a Jewish (though not religious) family.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{cite book|title=Inquiries and provocations : selected writings, 1929-1974|last=Feigl|first=Herbert|publisher=D. Reidel Pub. Co.|year=1981|isbn=90-277-1101-1}}</ref><ref name=":3" /> He matriculated at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1922 and studied [[physics]] and [[philosophy]] under [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], [[Hans Thirring]], and [[Karl Bühler]].<ref name=":0" /> He became one of the members of the Vienna Circle in 1924<ref name=":0" /> and would be one of the few Circle members (along with Schlick and [[Friedrich Waismann]]<ref name=":2" />) to have extensive conversations with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]]. Feigl received his doctorate at Vienna in 1927 for his dissertation ''Zufall und Gesetz: Versuch einer naturerkenntnistheoretischen Klarung des Wahrscheinlichkeits- und Induktionsproblems'' (''Chance and Law: An Epistemological Analysis of the Roles of Probability and Induction in the Natural Sciences'').<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /> He published his first book, ''Theorie und Erfahrung in der Physik'' (''Theory and Experience in Physics''), in 1929.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/feigl-herbert|title=Feigl, Herbert [Encyclopaedia Judaica]|last=Avrum Stroll/Ruth Beloff|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref><ref name=":3" /> 

In 1930, on an International [[Rockefeller Foundation]] scholarship at [[Harvard University]],<ref name=":2" /> Feigl met the physicist [[Percy Williams Bridgman]], the philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], and the psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]],<ref name=":3" /> all of whom he saw as kindred spirits. In 1931, with [[Albert Blumberg]], he published the paper "Logical Positivism: A New European Movement"<ref name=":0" /> which argued for [[logical positivism]] to be renamed "logical empiricism" based upon certain [[Philosophical realism|realist]] differences between contemporary [[philosophy of science]] and the older [[positivist]] movement.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCWLpalg7tAC&pg=PA40|title=The Vienna Circle in the Nordic Countries : networks and transformations of logical empiricism|last=Faye|first=Jan|date=2010|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media|others=Manninen, Juha., Stadler, Friedrich.|isbn=9789048136834|location=Dordrecht|pages=40|chapter=Niels Bohr and the Vienna Circle|oclc=567371218|quote=[8] Albert Blumberg and Feigl suggested in their 1931 paper “Logical Positivism. A New European Movement” that logical positivism was renamed “logical empiricism” because of certain differences between the new and the older positivist movement.}}</ref>

In 1930, Feigl married Maria Kaspar<ref name=":0" /> and emigrated with her to the United States, settling in [[Iowa]] to take up a position in the philosophy department at the [[University of Iowa]].<ref name=":3" /> Their son, Eric Otto, was born in 1933. In 1940, Herbert Feigl accepted a position as professor of philosophy at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he remained for 31 years.<ref name=":0" /> His close professional and personal relationship with [[Wilfrid Sellars]] produced many different collaborative projects, including the textbook ''Readings in Philosophical Analysis'' and the journal ''Philosophical Studies'', which he and Sellars (with other colleagues) founded in 1949.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" />

In 1953, he established the [[Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science]] (the first center of its kind in the United States)<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /> with a grant from the Hill Foundation.<ref name=":3" /> He was appointed Regents Professor of the University of Minnesota in 1967.<ref name=":2" />

Feigl believed that [[empiricism]] is the only adequate philosophy for [[experimental science]]. Though he became a philosopher instead of a chemist, he never lost the perspective, and the scientific commonsense, of a practical scientist. He was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |access-date=October 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archive-date=October 20, 2012 }}</ref> and he was, in the paradigmatic sense, a philosopher of science. 

Feigl retired in 1971 and died of [[cancer]] on 1 June 1988 in [[Minneapolis]].<ref name=":0" /> He was joined in death by his wife Maria the following year; they were survived by their son Eric O. Feigl, a professor of [[physiology]] at the University of Washington.<ref name=":3" />
