'''Pierre Maurice Marie Duhem''' ({{IPA|fr|pjɛʁ mɔʁis maʁi dy.ɛm, – moʁ-|lang|Pierre duhem pronunciation.ogg}}; 9 June<ref>Jaki, Stanley L. (1987). ''Uneasy Genius: The Life and Work of Pierre Duhem''. Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff, p. 3.</ref> 1861 – 14 September 1916) was a French theoretical [[physicist]] who worked on [[thermodynamics]], [[hydrodynamics]], and the theory of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].  Duhem was also a [[history of science|historian of science]], noted for his work on the European [[Middle Ages]], which is regarded as having created the field of the history of medieval science.<ref name=":0" />As a [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], he is remembered principally for his views on the indeterminacy of experimental criteria (see [[Duhem–Quine thesis]]).

==Early life and education==
Duhem completed a Ph.D. in 1888 at [[Université Paul Sabatier]] titled ''Étude historique sur la théorie de l'aimantation par influence''.<ref name=phd>{{cite thesis | last=Duhem | first=Pierre Maurice Marie | title=Étude historique sur la théorie de l'aimantation par influence | year=1888 | oclc=34976080 | language=fr | page= |url=https://afst.centre-mersenne.org/item/AFST_1888_1_2__1_0/}}</ref>

==Theoretical physics==
Among scientists, Duhem is best known today for his work on [[chemical thermodynamics]], and in particular for the [[Gibbs–Duhem equation|Gibbs–Duhem]] and [[Duhem–Margules equation]]s.  His approach was strongly influenced by the early works of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], which Duhem effectively explained and promoted among French scientists.  In [[continuum mechanics]], he is also remembered for his contribution to what is now called the [[Clausius–Duhem inequality]].
 
Duhem was a supporter of [[Energeticism|energetics]] and was convinced that all physical phenomena, including mechanics, electromagnetism, and chemistry, could be derived from the principles of thermodynamics.<ref name=":0">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Pierre Duhem|encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duhem/|author=Roger Ariew|year=2007|access-date=2009-11-07}}</ref> Influenced by [[William Rankine]]'s "Outlines of the Science of Energetics",<ref>Macquorn Rankine (1855). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=uU8EAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA120 Outlines of the Science of Energetics]," ''The Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal'', Vol. II, pp. 120–140.</ref> Duhem carried out this intellectual project in his ''Traité de l'Énergétique'' (1911), but was ultimately unable to reduce electromagnetic phenomena to thermodynamic first principles.

With [[Ernst Mach]], Duhem shared a skepticism about the reality and usefulness of the concept of [[atom]]s.<ref>See Hentschel (1988) on these and other parallels between Duhem and Mach, and on their correspondence.</ref>  He therefore did not follow the [[statistical mechanics]] of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], and Gibbs, who explained the laws of thermodynamics in terms of the statistical properties of mechanical systems composed of many atoms.

Duhem was an opponent of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=McMullin, Ernan|year=1990|title=Comment: Duhem's Middle Way|journal=[[Synthese]]|volume=83|issue=3|pages=421–430|doi=10.1007/BF00413426 |s2cid=46980317 }}</ref><ref name="Gillies 1993">Gillies, Donald.

==History of science==
[[File:Oresme-Nicole.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Nicole Oresme]], a prominent medieval scholar. Duhem came to regard the medieval scholastic tradition as the origin of modern science.]]

Duhem is well known for his work on the [[history of science]],<ref>"Pierre Duhem, himself a distinguished physicist, initiated in heroic fashion, almost singlehandedly, the modern study of the history of medieval science by the simple but effective expedient of reading and analyzing as many medieval scientific manuscripts as possible." — Palter, Robert M.

He thus filled the hiatus that had existed between Greek and Arabic science, on the one extreme, and early modern science in the seventeenth-century Europe, on the other. For the first time, the history of science was provided with a genuine sense of continuity." — Grant, Edward (1996). ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages''. Cambridge University Press, p. xi.</ref> which resulted in the ten volume ''Le système du monde: histoire des doctrines cosmologiques de Platon à Copernic'' (''The System of World: A History of Cosmological Doctrines from Plato to Copernicus'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Duhem|first=Pierre|title=Le système du monde: histoire des doctrines cosmologiques de Platon à Copernic'' (''The System of World: A History Cosmological Doctrines from Plato to Copernicus)|url=https://archive.org/details/lesystmedumond01duhe|year=1914|publisher=Paris, A. Hermann }}</ref> Unlike many former historians (e.g. [[Voltaire]] and [[Condorcet]]), who denigrated the [[Middle Ages]], he endeavored to show that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had helped foster Western science in one of its most fruitful periods. His work in this field was originally prompted by his research into the origins of [[statics]], where he encountered the works of medieval mathematicians and philosophers such as [[John Buridan]], [[Nicole Oresme]] and [[Roger Bacon]], whose sophistication surprised him. He consequently came to regard them as the founders of modern science, having in his view anticipated many of the discoveries of [[Galileo Galilei]] and later thinkers.<ref>Wallace, William A. (1984). ''Prelude, Galileo and his Sources. The Heritage of the Collegio Romano in Galileo's Science''.

In philosophy of science, Duhem is best known for arguing that hypotheses are not straightforwardly refuted by experiment and that there are no crucial experiments in science. Duhem’s formulation of his thesis is that “if the predicted phenomenon is not produced, not only is the questioned proposition put into doubt, but also the whole theoretical scaffolding used by the physicist”.{{sfn|Massey|2011|loc=Sec. 1}}  Duhem's views on the philosophy of science are explained in his 1906 work ''The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory''.<ref name=aim>{{cite book|last=Duhem|first=Pierre|others=Philip P. Wiener (Foreword) Jules Vuillemin (Introduction)|trans-title=The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory|title=La Théorie Physique: son Objet et sa Structure|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1954|isbn=978-0-691-02524-7}}</ref> In this work, he opposed [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s statement that the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'s'' [[Newton's Law of Gravity|law of universal mutual gravitation]] was [[Deductive reasoning|deduced]] from '[[phenomena]]', including [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s second and third laws. Newton's claims in this regard had already been attacked by critical proof-analyses of the German logician [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and then most famously by [[Immanuel Kant]], following [[David Hume|Hume]]'s logical critique of [[inductive reasoning|induction]]. But the novelty of Duhem's work was his proposal that Newton's theory of universal mutual gravity flatly ''contradicted'' Kepler's Laws of planetary motion because the interplanetary mutual gravitational [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s caused deviations from Keplerian [[orbit]]s. Since no contingent [[proposition]] can be [[Validity (logic)|validly]] logically deduced from any it contradicts, according to Duhem, Newton must not have logically deduced his law of gravitation directly from Kepler's Laws.<ref name=aim/><ref>{{cite book|last=Lakatos|first=Imre|author2=Paul Feyerabend |author3=Matteo Motterlini |title=For and Against Method: Including Lakatos's Lectures on Scientific Method and the Lakatos-Feyerabend Correspondence|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1999|pages=45–49|isbn=978-0-226-46774-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lakatos|first=Imre|author2=John Worrall |author3=Gregory Currie |title=The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980|chapter=5: Newton's Effect on Scientific Standards|isbn=978-0-521-28031-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lakatos|first=Imre|author2=John Worrall |author3=Gregory Currie |title=Mathematics, Science, and Epistemology|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1978|chapter=5: The Method of Analysis-Synthesis|isbn=978-0-521-21769-9}}</ref> 

===Opposition to the English inductivist tradition===
Duhem argues that physics is subject to certain methodological limitations that do not affect other sciences. In his ''The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory''<ref name=aim/> (1906), Duhem critiqued the [[Baconian method|Baconian]] notion of "crucial experiments". According to this critique, an experiment in physics is not simply an observation, but rather an interpretation of observations by means of a theoretical framework. Furthermore, no matter how well one constructs one's experiment, it is impossible to subject an isolated single hypothesis to an experimental test. Instead, it is a whole interlocking group of hypotheses, background assumptions, and theories that is tested. This thesis has come to be known as [[confirmation holism]]. This inevitable holism, according to Duhem, renders crucial experiments impossible. More generally, Duhem was critical of Newton's description of the method of physics as a straightforward "deduction" from facts and observations.

===Duhem's philosophy of science and faith===
In the appendix to ''The Aim and Structure'', entitled "Physics of a Believer," Duhem draws out the implications that he sees his philosophy of science as having for those who argue that there is a conflict between physics and religion. He writes, "metaphysical and religious doctrines are judgments touching on objective reality, whereas the principles of physical theory are propositions relative to certain mathematical signs stripped of all objective existence. Since they do not have any common term, these two sorts of judgments can neither contradict nor agree with each other" (p.&nbsp;285). Nonetheless, Duhem argues that it is important for the theologian or metaphysician to have detailed knowledge of physical theory in order not to make illegitimate use of it in speculations. Duhem's philosophy of science was criticized by one of his contemporaries, [[Abel Rey]], in part because of what Rey perceived as influence on the part of Duhem's Catholic faith.{{sfn|Page|2018|p=5}}  Although Duhem was indeed a believer, a sincere and fervent Catholic, he was eager to point out that his works in physics and chemistry should be considered on their own merits, independent of his religion. They were not examples of "Catholic science," nor even colored by his Catholic faith.{{sfn|Kragh|2008}}{{refn|name=DuhemSeparationScienceReligion}}
