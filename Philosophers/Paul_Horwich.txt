'''Paul Gordon Horwich''' (born 1947) is a British [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] at [[New York University]], noted for his contributions to [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of physics]], the philosophy of language (especially [[truth]] and meaning) and the interpretation of [[Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy.

==Education and career==

Horwich read Physics at Oxford, graduating in 1968, and earned his PhD in Philosophy from [[Cornell University]] in 1975 with a thesis on ''The Metric and Topology of Time'', under the direction of [[Richard Boyd]]. He began his academic career at [[MIT]], where he taught from 1973 until 1994, when he took up a post at [[University College London]]. He returned to the U.S. in 2000, to take up a chair at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]]. He moved to [[New York University Department of Philosophy|NYU]] in 2005.<ref>[https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/philosophy/documents/faculty-documents/horwich/Horwich-Paul-CV.pdf as.nyu.edu]</ref>

==Philosophical work==

In ''Truth'' (1990), Horwich presented a detailed defence of the [[Minimalism (philosophy)|''minimalist'' variant]] of the [[deflationary theory of truth]]. He is opposed to appealing to reference and truth to explicate meaning, and so has defended a naturalistic [[use theory of meaning]] in his book ''Meaning''. Other concepts he has advanced are a probabilistic account of [[scientific methodology]] and a unified explanation of temporally asymmetric phenomena.<ref>[http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/paulhorwich NYU faculty page]</ref>

In the context of philosophical speculations about [[time travel]], Horwich coined the term autofanticide for a variant of the [[grandfather paradox]], in which a person goes back in time and deliberately or inadvertently kills their infant self.<ref>''Asymmetries in Time: Problems in the Philosophy of Science'' by Paul Horwich, MIT Press, 1987.</ref>
