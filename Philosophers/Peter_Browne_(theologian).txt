'''Peter Browne''' (23 December 1665 – 27 August 1735) was an Irish Anglican priest who served as the 17th [[Provost of Trinity College Dublin]] from 1699 to 1710. He was also [[Bishop of Cork and Ross]].

==Life==
Born in [[Dublin]] in 1665, Browne entered [[Trinity College Dublin]], in 1682, and after ten years' residence obtained a fellowship.<ref>"Alumni Dublinenses : a register of the students, graduates, professors and provosts of [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College in the University of Dublin]] (1593–1860) [[George Dames Burtchaell]]/[[Thomas Ulick Sadleir]] p101: Dublin, Alex Thom and Co, 1935</ref> In 1699, he was made [[List of Provosts of Trinity College Dublin|Provost]], and in the same year published his ''Letter in answer to a Book entitled "Christianity not Mysterious,"'' which was recognized as the ablest reply yet written to [[John Toland|Toland]]. It expounds in germ the whole of his later theory of analogy. Browne was a man of abstemious habits, charitable disposition, and impressive eloquence. In 1710, he was made bishop of Cork and Ross, which post he held till his death in 1735.

==Works==
In 1713, Browne became known for his vigorous pamphleteering attack on the fashion of drinking healths, especially "to the glorious and immortal memory." His two most important works are the ''Procedure, Extent, and Limits of the Human Understanding'' (1728), an able though sometimes captious critique of [[John Locke|Locke]]'s essay, and ''Things Divine and Supernatural conceived by Analogy with Things Natural and Human, more briefly referred to as the Divine Analogy'' (1733).

The doctrine of analogy was intended as a reply to the [[deism|deistical]] conclusions that had been drawn from Locke's theory of knowledge. Browne holds that not only God's essence, but his attributes are inexpressible by our ideas, and can only be conceived analogically. This view was vigorously assailed as leading to [[atheism]] by [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] in his ''[[Alciphron (book)|Alciphron]]'' (Dialogue iv.), and a great part of the ''Divine Analogy'' is occupied with a defence against that criticism. The bishop emphasizes the distinction between metaphor and analogy; though the conceived attributes are not thought. as they are in themselves, yet there is a reality corresponding in some way to our ideas of them.

His analogical arguments resemble those found in the [[Bampton Lectures]] of [[Henry Longueville Mansel|Dean Mansel]].
