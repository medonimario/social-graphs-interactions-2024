'''Richard Granville Swinburne''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|w|ɪ|n|b|ɜr|n}}; born 26 December 1934) is an English [[philosopher]]. He is an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Oxford]]. Over the last 50 years, Swinburne has been a proponent of philosophical [[Existence of God#Arguments for the existence of God|arguments for the existence of God]]. His [[philosophy|philosophical]] contributions are primarily in the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[philosophy of science]]. He aroused much discussion with his early work in the philosophy of religion, a trilogy of books consisting of ''The Coherence of Theism'', ''[[The Existence of God (book)|The Existence of God]]'', and ''Faith and Reason''. He has been influential in reviving [[substance dualism]] as an option in [[philosophy of mind]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robinson, Howard|year=2021|title=The Revival of Substance Dualism|journal=Roczniki Filozoficzne|volume=69|issue=1|pages=33–44|doi=10.18290/rf21691-4 |jstor=27031914|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Swinburne was born in [[Smethwick]], [[Staffordshire]], England, on 26 December 1934. His father was a school music teacher, who was himself the son of an off-licence owner in [[Shoreditch]]. His mother was a secretary, the daughter of an optician. He is an only child. Swinburne attended a preparatory school and then [[Charterhouse School]].

==Academic career==
Swinburne received an open scholarship to study [[classics]] at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], but in fact graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class]] [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[philosophy, politics, and economics]]. Swinburne has held various professorships throughout his career in academia. From 1972 to 1985, he taught at [[Keele University]]. During part of this time, he gave the [[Gifford lectures]] at [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]] from 1982 to 1984, resulting in the book ''The Evolution of the Soul''. From 1985 until his retirement in 2002, he was [[Nolloth Professor of the Philosophy of the Christian Religion]] at the [[University of Oxford]] (his successor to this chair was [[Brian Leftow]]). He has continued to publish regularly since his retirement.<ref>[https://users.ox.ac.uk/~orie0087/    Richard Swinburne - short intellectual autobiography]</ref>

Swinburne has been an active author throughout his career, producing a major book every two to three years. He has played a role in the recent debate over the [[mind–body problem]], defending a [[substance dualism]] that recalls the work of [[René Descartes]] in important respects (see ''The Evolution of the Soul'', 1997).

His books are primarily very technical works of academic philosophy, but he has written at the popular level as well. Of the non-technical works, his ''[[Is There a God?]]'' (1996), summarising for a non-specialist audience many of his [[arguments for the existence of God]] and plausibility in the belief of that existence, is probably the most popular and is available in 22 languages.<ref>Ozioko, Johnson Uchenna (2019). Rationality of the Christian Faith in Richard Swinburne. Rome: Urbaniana University Press.</ref>

In 1992 he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]].<ref>[https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/fellows/richard-swinburne-FBA/ The British Academy for Humanities and Social Sciences.]</ref> He is a recipient of [[James Joyce Award]] from the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin. Also, he was awarded honorary doctorates by the [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|Catholic University of Lublin]] (2015),<ref>[https://www.kul.pl/professor-richard-swinburne-doctor-honoris-causa-kul,art_64147.html Professor Richard Swinburne - Doctor honoris causa KUL]</ref> [[Dimitrie Cantemir Christian University]] in Bucharest (2016),&nbsp;the International Academy of Philosophy in Liechtenstein (2017), and [[New Georgian University|New Georgian&nbsp;University in Poti]]&nbsp;(2023).<ref>[http://ngu.edu.ge/en/about-university/sapatio-doktorebi/profesori-richard-suinberni New Georgian University honors Professor Richard Swinburne]</ref>

==Christian apologetics==

A member of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], Swinburne is noted as one of the foremost [[Christian apologist]]s, arguing in his many articles and books that faith in Christianity is rational and coherent in a rigorous philosophical sense. [[William Hasker]] writes that his "tetralogy on Christian doctrine, together with his earlier trilogy on the philosophy of theism, is one of the most important apologetic projects of recent times."<ref>Hasker, William (2002). "Is Christianity Probable? Swinburne's Apologetic Programme". Religious Studies. 38 (3): 253–264. doi:10.1017/S0034412502006078. ISSN 1469-901X. JSTOR 20008419. S2CID 170888913.</ref> While Swinburne presents many arguments to advance the belief that God exists, he argues that God is a being whose existence is not logically necessary (see [[modal logic]]) but [[metaphysic]]ally necessary in a way he defines in his ''The Christian God''. Other subjects on which Swinburne writes include [[personal identity]] (in which he espouses a view based on the concept of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]), and [[epistemic justification]]. He has written in defence of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]] and [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian free will]].<ref>Swinburne, Richard (2013). Mind, Brain, and Free Will.</ref>

Although he is best known for his vigorous defence of Christian intellectual commitments, he also has a theory of the nature of passionate faith which is developed in his book ''Faith and Reason''.

According to an interview Swinburne did with ''Foma'' magazine, he converted from [[Anglican Communion|Anglicanism]] ([[Church of England]]) to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] around 1996:
<blockquote>I don't think I changed my beliefs in any significant way. I always believed in the [[Apostolic succession]]: that the Church has to have its authority dating back to the Apostles, and the general teaching of the Orthodox Church on the saints and the prayers for the departed and so on, these things I have always believed.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=БЕЗОТВЕТСТВЕННОЕ ПРИГЛАШЕНИЕ К СЕРЬЕЗНОМУ РАЗГОВОРУ |url=http://www.foma.ru/article/index.php?news=2368&sphrase_id=899158 |url-status=dead |magazine=Foma |language=ru |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222214436/http://www.foma.ru/article/index.php?news=2368&sphrase_id=899158 |archive-date=22 February 2014 |access-date=2012-02-17}}</ref></blockquote>

Swinburne's philosophical method reflects the influence of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. He admits that he draws from Aquinas a systematic approach to philosophical theology. Swinburne, like Aquinas, moves from basic philosophical issues (for example, the question of the possibility that God may exist in Swinburne's ''The Coherence of Theism''), to more specific Christian beliefs (for example, the claim in Swinburne's ''Revelation'' that God has communicated to human beings propositionally in [[Jesus Christ]]).<ref>Chartier, Gary (2013). "Richard Swinburne". In Markham, Ian S. (ed.). The Student's Companion to the Theologians. Chichester, England: Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 522–526. doi:10.1002/9781118427170.ch75. ISBN 978-1-118-42717-0.</ref>

Swinburne moves in his writing program from the philosophical to the theological, building his case and relying on his previous arguments as he defends particular Christian beliefs. He has attempted to reassert classical Christian beliefs with an apologetic method that he believes is compatible with contemporary science. That method relies heavily on [[inductive logic]], seeking to show that his Christian beliefs fit best with the evidence.<ref>Schellenberg, J. L. (2016). "Working with Swinburne: Belief, Value, and Religious Life". In Bergmann, Michael; Brower, Jeffrey E. (eds.). Reason and Faith: Themes from Richard Swinburne. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 26–45. doi:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198732648.003.0002. ISBN 978-0-19-873264-8.</ref>
