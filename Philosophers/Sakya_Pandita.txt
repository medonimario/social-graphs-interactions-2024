He is held in the tradition to have been an emanation of [[Manjusri]], the embodiment of the wisdom of all the Buddhas.{{sfnb|Pal|1997|p=49}}

Sakya Pandita was also known as a great scholar in [[Tibet]], [[India]], [[Mongolia]] and [[China]] and was proficient in the five great sciences of Buddhist philosophy, medicine, grammar, dialectics and sacred [[Sanskrit literature]] as well as the minor sciences of rhetoric, synonymies, poetry, music, dancing and astrology. He is considered to be the fourth Sakya Forefather and sixth [[Sakya Trizin]] and one of the most important figures in the Sakya lineage.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
[[File:Sakya Pandita, Kunga Gyaltsen Pal Zangpo.jpg|thumb|250px|Sakya Pandita]]
Sakya Pandita was born as Palden Dondup at [[Sa'gya County|Sakya]] in the noble family of Jamyanggön (Khön).{{sfnb|Penny-Dimri|1995|p=71}} This lineage had held the abbotship of Sakya on a hereditary basis since 1073. His father was Palchen Öpoche (1150–1203) and his mother Machig Nyitri Cham. Sakya Pandita was the nephew of [[Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen]] (1147–1216), and became the principal disciple of this prominent scholar.<ref name="tibetgov">The Government of Tibet in Exile. [http://www.tibet.com/Buddhism/sakya.html The Sakya Tradition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613081114/http://tibet.com/Buddhism/sakya.html |date=2006-06-13 }}. Retrieved September 26, 2007.</ref> He was instructed in the [[sutra]]s and [[tantra]]s by Dragpa Gyaltsen and mastered Sanskrit and three Inner Asian languages. Eventually he was initiated as a [[śrāmaṇera]] by his master and given the religious name Künga Gyeltsen.

As a young monk, he visited the prominent [[Kashmir]]i scholar [[Śakya Śri]], who ordained him as a [[bhikkhu|bhikśu]] in 1208, and taught him sutras and mantras. Legend has it that he visited [[Gyirong County|Kyirong]] on his way back, and there defeated a [[brahman]] [[Shastri (degree)|Shastri]] in a debate on logic. He then overcome his opponent in a contest of supernatural powers. As he wanted to show his fellow Tibetans the peculiar dress of [[Brahmin|Indian Brahmin]] priests, he brought the Shastri to Tibet where he was killed by the protective deities of the land. The Shastri's head was then tied to a pillar of the great temple in Sakya which remained until modern times.{{sfnb|Das|1970|pp=97-8}}<ref>According to Townsend, Dominique (2010) "Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyeltsen", [http://www.treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Sakya-Pandita-Kunga-Gyeltsen/2137] this took place later, in 1240.</ref> The experience of Sakya Pandita with Indian learning provided a notably [[Culture of India|Indian]] influence to his scholarship later on. His ordination as bhikśu marked the inception of Sakya as a proper monastic order.<ref>[[Matthew Kapstein|Kapstein, Matthew]] (2006) ''The Tibetans''. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 110–1.</ref> He acceded as ''dansa chenpo'' or abbot-ruler of Sakya upon the death of his uncle Dragpa Gyaltsen in 1216.

===Mongol invasion===

In 1253 [[Kublai Khan]] invited Sakya Pandita's Nephew [[Chogyal Phagpa]] to court. As a result, Buddhism was declared the state religion and Phagpa was given authority over three of Tibet's provinces.]]

{{See also|Mongol conquest of Tibet}}
According to later Tibetan historiography, [[Genghis Khan]] subjugated a king of Tibet in 1206 and then sent a letter to the Sakya abbot. After the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, the Tibetans stopped sending tribute. This is, however, a legend without historical foundation.<ref>[[Luciano Petech|Petech, Luciano]] (1990) ''Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Yüan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history''. Rome: IsIMEO, p. 6.</ref> It is known, however, that the grandson of Genghis Khan and second son of [[Ögedei Khan]], [[Godan Khan]] was granted an appanage at Liangzhou (present-day [[Wuwei, Gansu]]) in 1239. In 1240 he sent an invasion force under Dorta into Tibet. The [[Mongols]] reached the Phanyul Valley north of [[Lhasa]], killing some 500 monks and destroying and looting monasteries, villages and towns. The Gyal Lhakhang Monastery went up in flames and many monks of the [[Reting Monastery]] were slaughtered by the horsemen.<ref>[[Giuseppe Tucci|Tucci, Giuseppe]] (1949) ''Tibetan painted scrolls''. Rome, Vol. II, p. 652.</ref> The [[Drigung Monastery]] was saved, ostensibly since the Mongols believed that a sudden avalanche of stones could be attributed to the supernatural powers of the lamas. According to [[Luciano Petech|L. Petech]], the [[Reting Monastery]] itself escaped destruction when Dorta reached [[Damxung County|Dam]], and its abbot suggested the Mongols to contact Sakya Paṇḍita, who was a famous author and religious figure and could represent the Tibetans vis-à-vis the Mongols.<ref name="Petech, Luciano 1990 p. 8">Petech, Luciano (1990) p. 8.</ref> According to J.Y. Chang, it was rather the Drigung abbot who made the proposal.<ref>Chang, Jiunn Yih (1984) ''A study of the relationship between the Mongol Yuan Dynasty and the Tibetan Sa-skya Sect''. PhD Thesis, Indiana University, p. 29.</ref> Later chronicles assert that Dorta sent message to Prince Godan and enumerated the four foremost sects and lamas of Tibet: [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]], [[Taklung Monastery|Taklung]], [[Drigung Monastery|Drigung]], and Sakya. Godan drew the conclusion that Sakya Pandita was an important and wise lama who could show the road to salvation, and ordered to send a letter of "invitation" and presents to him.<ref>[[Fifth Dalai Lama]] (1995) ''A history of Tibet''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 90–1.</ref> The actual reason for selecting the Sakya might have been that the sect was specialized in magic rituals that resonated with Mongol beliefs, and was prominent in spreading Buddhist morality. It was also important that Sakya Paṇḍita was a religious hierarch by birth, and thus represented a dynastic continuity useful for the Mongol aim to rule via respected intermediaries.<ref>Chang (1984) p. 28.</ref>

===The stay at the Mongol court===
In fact, recent research has shown that the letter of summons sent by Godan is a later fabrication.<ref name="Petech, Luciano 1990 p. 8"/> Nevertheless, Sakya Pandita was indeed summoned to come to Godan's royal camp at Liangzhou in 1244. The cleric left Sakya in the company of his two young nephews, the ten-year-old [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa|Phagpa]] and six-year-old Chakna Dorje. As he continually preached sermons along his way he did not arrive at Prince Godan's camp until 1246. There he had to wait for Godan who at the time participated in the [[Kurultai]] where [[Güyük Khan]] was enthroned. Sakya Paṇḍita and Godan first met in early 1247.<ref>Petech, Luciano (1990), p. 8.</ref> He gave religious instruction to the prince and greatly impressed the court with his personality and powerful teachings. He is also said to have cured Prince Godan of a serious illness, probably [[leprosy]].<ref>According to [[Thubten Jigme Norbu|Norbu, Thubten Jigme]] and [[Colin Turnbull|Turnbull, Colin]] (1969) ''Tibet: Its History, Religion and People''. Chatto & Windus. Reprint: Penguin Books (1987), p. 195, and Townsend, Dominique, "Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyeltsen" (2010), [http://www.treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Sakya-Pandita-Kunga-Gyeltsen/2137], Sakya Paṇḍita, with the help of his nephew, Phagpa, adapted the [[Uighur script]] so that the Buddhist Scriptures could be translated into Mongolian which, until that time, was an unwritten language. This is not clear from more detailed studies which indicate that the new script was developed much later, in the 1260s.</ref> In return, he was allegedly given "temporal authority over the 13 myriarchies [''Trikor Chuksum''] of Central Tibet."<ref>[[Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa|Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D.]] (1967) ''Tibet: A Political History''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, p. 63.</ref> Since the myriarchies were not yet constituted by this time the story is not entirely correct. It should be understood in the sense that Sakya Paṇḍita was used as the main agent of the Mongols in Tibetan affairs. Tibetan historians quote a long letter by his hand to the various clerical and temporal lords in Tibet in 1249. In order to spare Tibet from devastating invasions, he wrote, it was necessary that the local regimes unconditionally accepted Mongol overlordship. A census was to be taken, and the lords must henceforth carry out the administration in consultation with envoys dispatched by Sakya and in accordance with Mongol law.<ref>The letter is accepted as genuine in Petech, Luciano (1990), p. 9, and Van Schaik, Sam (2011) ''Tibet: A history''. New Haven & London: Yale University Press, p. 77. Jackson, David P. (1987) [http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/jts/pdf/JTS_06_02.pdf] argues that it may be authored long after Sakya Paṇḍita's death.</ref> However, the sources keep silent about the actual imposition of Mongol rule in these years. The death of Güyük Khan in 1248 led to internal rivalries in the dynasty of Genghis Khan until the enthronement of [[Möngke Khan]] in 1251. This left Tibetan affairs in a state of limbo for the time being.<ref>[[Turrell V. Wylie|Wylie, Turrell V.]], 'The first Mongol conquest of Tibet reinterpreted', in McKay, Alex (ed.), ''The history of Tibet'', Vol. II. London & New York 2003, p. 323.</ref>

===Death and inheritance===
Sakya Pandita died on 28 November 1251, at the age of seventy, in the Trulpaide temple in Liangzhou.<ref>Petech, Luciano (1990), p. 10. According to the legendary account in Das, Sarat Chandra (1970) ''Contributions on the religion and history of Tibet''. New Delhi: Manjusri, p. 98, he died in the city of Gyu-ma.</ref> He chose his brother's son Chogyal Phagpa as his heir, and nominated him before his death as the successor to his religious authority by giving him his conch shell and begging bowl.<ref>[[Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa|Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D.]] (1967) ''Tibet: A Political History''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, pp. 62–3.</ref> After his death Phagpa continued his mission.<ref>[[Rolf A. Stein|Stein, R. A.]] (1972) ''Tibetan Civilization''. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (pbk), p. 106.</ref> The conch is one of the [[Ashtamangala]] and the begging bowl was a particular symbol of [[Gautama Buddha]] and the [[śramaṇa]]s.

After Sakya Pandita's death, the new Mongol ruler [[Möngke Khan]] chose to patronize the [[Drikung Kagyu]] while the other main schools were put under the protection of various Mongol princes. Nevertheless, a decree from 1252 stated that the Sakya precepts should be followed in the main. Meanwhile, Phagpa won a position in the court of Möngke's brother [[Kublai Khan]] and became the tantric guru of the prince in 1258. When Kublai came to power in 1260 he appointed Phagpa ''guoshi'' "preceptor of the kingdom".<ref>Schaik, Sam Van (2011) ''Tibet: A history''. New Haven & London: Yale University Press, p. 77.</ref> Thus began a strong Sakya-Mongol alliance, and the seat or ''densa'' ({{bo|w=gdan sa}}) of Sakya became the administrative capital of Tibet in 1264. This lasted until about the middle of the 14th century. During the reign of the 14th [[Sakya Trizin]], [[Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen]], the myriarch [[Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen]] of the [[Phagmodrupa dynasty]] began to subordinate the Central Tibetan province [[Ü (region)|Ü]], marking the "beginning of the end of the period of Sakya power in Central Tibet."<ref>Penny-Dimri, Sandra (1995) "The Lineage of His Holiness Sakya Trizin Ngawang-Kunga." ''The Tibet Journal'', Vol. XX No. 4, Winter 1995, pp.&nbsp;71–3.</ref><ref>[[Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa|Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D.]] (1967) ''Tibet: A Political History''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, p. 86.</ref>

In the lineage of the [[Tibet]]an [[Panchen Lama]]s there were considered to be four Indian and three Tibetan [[tulku]]s of [[Amitābha]] before [[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama]]. The lineage starts with [[Subhuti]], one of the original disciples of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Sakya Paṇḍita is considered to be the second Tibetan emanation of Amitābha in this line.<ref>Stein, R. A. (1972) ''Tibetan Civilization''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (paper), p. 84.</ref><ref>Das, Sarat Chandra (1970) ''Contributions on the Religion and History of Tibet''.

==Work==
He is best known for his works such as the ''Treasury of Logic on Valid Cognition (Tshad ma rigs pa'i gter)'' and the ''Discrimination of the Three Vows (sDom-gsum rab-dbye)''.<ref name=tibetgov/> He produced five major works in all, the other three being ''The Entrance Gate for the Wise (Mkhas pa rnams 'jug pa'i sgo)'', ''Clarifying the Sage's Intention (Thub pa'i dgongs gsal)'', and the ''Elegant Sayings of Sakya Pandita (sa skya legs bshad).''<ref>Jackson, David P. (1997) ''The Entrance Gate for the Wise (Section III): Saskya Pandita on Indian and Tibetan Traditions of Pramana and Philosophical Debate''. Wien: Arbeitskreis für Tibetisch und Buddhistiche Studien Universiteit, p. 2.</ref> The latter is a collection of moral precepts in verse which was imitated by others and translated into [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]].<ref>Stein, R. A. (1972) ''Tibetan Civilization''. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (pbk), p. 268.</ref>

Sakya Pandita focused on doctrine and logic "basing himself upon the ''[[Pramanavarttika]]'' of [[Dharmakirti]]" and was very interested in rhetoric. With his profound knowledge of [[History of Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]], Sakya Paṇḍita was observant of what he saw as aberrations in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. He was suspicious of lamas who promised enlightenment without going through the consecutive stages of Buddhist practices, and he took a more conservative view. The scholastic tradition of Tibetan Buddhism owes much to him, and his works are still included in the monastic curricula today.<ref>Van Schaik, Sam (2011), pp. 76–7.</ref>

According to José Cabezón, Sakya Pandita wrote numerous critiques of Tibetan Buddhist doctrines of his time. He was very concerned with refuting what he considered to be false views and practices in Tibet.<ref name=":1">Cabezón, José (2007). ''Freedom from Extremes'', p. 27. Wisdom Publications.</ref> In his ''Treasure of Reasoning'' (''Rigs gter''), he roundly critiques Chapa Chökyi Sengé's (1109–1169) interpretation of Dharmakirti's thought.<ref name=":1" />

Sakya Pandita is also known as a critic of a certain kind of [[Mahamudra]] theory and practice called White Panacea (''dkar po chig thub'') or “self-sufficient white remedy.” According to Cabezon, this "is the doctrine that “the realization of the nature of mind is sufficient in and of itself to bring about spontaneously and instantaneously the simultaneous consummation of all virtuous qualities, including [[Buddhahood]] itself.”"<ref name=":2">Cabezón, José (2007). ''Freedom from Extremes'', pp. 27-28. Wisdom Publications.</ref>

Sapan focused his critique on the figure of [[Gampopa]] (1079–1153), and his disciple, Zhang Tshal pa (1123–93).<ref name=":2" /> His critique was influential on numerous later figures, including the [[5th Dalai Lama|Fifth Dalai Lama]] (1617–82), [[Jamyang Zhepa|Jamyang Shepe Dorje Ngawang Tsondrü]] (1648–1722) and the Second Belmang, Konchok Gyeltsen  (1764–1853).<ref name=":2" />

His ''Treatise on Music'' provides valuable historical information about liturgical music theory and performance practice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Snellgrove |first1=David L. |last2=Richardson |first2=Hugh |title=A cultural history of Tibet |date=2015 |publisher=Orchid Press |location=Bangkok |isbn=9789745240339 |pages=281, 287 |edition=4th}}</ref><ref name=Canzio1979/>
