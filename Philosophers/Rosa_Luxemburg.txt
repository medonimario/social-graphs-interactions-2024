'''Rosa Luxemburg''' ({{langx|pl|Róża Luksemburg}}, {{IPA|pl|ˈruʐa ˈluksɛmburk||Róża Luksemburg wymowa (Rosa Luxemburg PL pronunciation).ogg}}; {{IPA|de|ˈʁoːza ˈlʊksm̩bʊʁk|lang|De-Rosa Luxemburg.ogg}}; born '''Rozalia Luksenburg'''; 5 March 1871 – 15 January 1919) was a Polish and naturalised-German [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]], [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]], and [[Opposition to World War I|anti-War activist]] during the [[First World War]]. She became a key figure of the revolutionary socialist movements of Poland and Germany during the late 19th and early 20th century, particularly the [[Spartacist uprising]].

Born and raised in a [[Jewish secularism|secular Jew]]ish family in [[Congress Poland]], she became a [[Second Reich|German]] citizen in 1897. The same year, she was awarded a [[Doctor of Law]] in [[political economy]] from the [[University of Zurich]], becoming one of the first women in Europe to do so. Successively, she was a member of the [[Proletariat (party)|Proletariat]] party, the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] (SDKPiL), the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]] (USPD), the [[Spartacus League]] ({{lang|de|Spartakusbund}}), and the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD).

After the SPD supported German involvement in [[World War I]] in 1915, Luxemburg and [[Karl Liebknecht]] co-founded the anti-war Spartacus League which eventually became the KPD. During the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|November Revolution]], she co-founded the newspaper {{lang|de|[[Die Rote Fahne]]}} (''The Red Flag''), the central organ of the Spartacist movement. Luxemburg considered the Spartacist uprising of January 1919 a blunder,<ref>Frederik Hetmann: ''Rosa Luxemburg. Ein Leben für die Freiheit'', p. 308.</ref> but supported the attempted overthrow of the SPD-ruled [[Weimar Republic]] and rejected any attempt at a negotiated solution. [[Friedrich Ebert]]'s SPD Cabinet crushed the revolt and the {{lang|de|Spartakusbund}} by sending in the {{lang|de|[[Freikorps]]}}, government-sponsored [[Weimar paramilitary groups|paramilitary groups]] consisting mostly of battle-hardened World War I veterans of the [[Imperial German Army]]. {{lang|de|Freikorps}} troops captured, tortured and executed<ref>{{Cite news |last=Feigel |first=Lara |date=2019-01-09 |title=The Murder of Rosa Luxemburg review – tragedy and farce |url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/09/the-murder-of-rosa-luxemburg-by-klaus-gietinger-review |access-date=2022-07-12 |work=[[The Guardian]] |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115163203/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/09/the-murder-of-rosa-luxemburg-by-klaus-gietinger-review |archive-date=2019-01-15}}</ref> Luxemburg and Liebknecht during the rebellion.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Christian |date=2023-01-15 |title=Cinco obras de Rosa Luxemburgo para recordar su legado |trans-title=Five works by Rosa Luxemburg to remember her legacy |url=https://www.tercerainformacion.es/articulo/memoria-historica/15/01/2023/cinco-obras-de-rosa-luxemburgo-para-recordar-su-legado/ |access-date=2023-01-16 |website=Tercera Información |language=es}}</ref>

Due to her pointed criticism of both the [[Leninism|Leninist]] and the more moderate [[social democracy|social democratic]] schools of [[Marxism]], Luxemburg has always had a somewhat ambivalent reception among scholars and theorists of the [[left-wing politics|political left]].<ref>[[Leszek Kołakowski]] ([1981], 2008), ''Main Currents of Marxism, Vol. 2: The Golden Age'', W.

[[File:Staszica 37 (Zamość).JPG|thumb|Luxemburg's birthplace in [[Zamość]], Poland]]

Little is known about Rozalia's great-grandparents, Elisza and Szayndla, but according to historical evidence it is likely they lived in [[Warsaw]].<ref name="rory">{{cite web|url=https://www.praktykateoretyczna.pl/artykuly/rory-castle-you-alone-will-make-our-familys-name-famous-rosa-luxemburg-her-family-and-the-origins-of-her-polish-jewish-identity/|title=Rosa Luxemburg, Her Family and the Origins of her Polish-Jewish Identity|website=praktykateoretyczna.pl|access-date=2021-12-03|date=2013-06-16|first=Rory|last=Castle|publisher=Praktyka Teoretyczna}}</ref> Their son, Rosa's grandfather, Abraham Luxemburg probably lived in Warsaw before marrying Chana Szlam (Rosa's grandmother) and moving to [[Zamość]].<ref name="rory" /> Abraham built a successful timber business there, based in Zamość and Warsaw but with links as far away as [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], [[Leipzig]], [[Berlin]], and [[Hamburg]]; although coming from humble origins, he became a wealthy businessman with transnational connections who could afford to provide for his children an education abroad in the [[German Empire]].<ref name="damian" /><ref name="rory" /> He supported the [[Reform Judaism|Jewish Reform movement]], becoming a prominent member of the Zamość [[Haskalah|Maskilim]].<ref name="rory" /> He was committed to [[Jewish emancipation]], spoke [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], and ensured that his children spoke these languages too; it is unclear whether he took part in the [[November Uprising]] (1830–31) or not.<ref name="rory" />

Abraham's son Edward was Róża's father.<ref name="rory" /> He was born in Zamość on 17 December 1830, the eldest of ten siblings and heir to his father's timber business.<ref name="rory" /><ref name="damian" /> Edward Eliasz Luxenburg lost his mother at the age of 18. He met his wife Lina Löwenstein through his stepmother Amalia, who was Lina's older sister.<ref name="rory" /> Lina and Amalia were daughters of the Rabbi of [[Velyki Mezhyrichi|Meseritz]], Isaak Ozer Löwenstein, and their brother was the reform Rabbi Isachar Dov Berish (Bernhard) Löwenstein of [[Lemberg]].<ref name="rory" /> Lina and Edward married around 1853 and lived together in Zamość, where Edward worked with his father.<ref name="rory" /> Like his father, Edward was a leading member of the Reform Jewish community in the city.<ref name="rory" /> When the [[January Uprising]] broke out, Edward delivered weapons to Polish partisans and organised fundraisers for the insurrection.<ref name="damian" /> After the fall of the uprising he became a target of the tsarist police and was forced into hiding in Warsaw, leaving his family behind in Zamość.<ref name="rory" /> During the 1860s and 1870s, Edward moved frequently and experienced financial difficulties; eventually the rest of the family, including two-year-old Rosa, joined him in Warsaw in 1873.<ref name="rory" /><ref name="nettl">J.

==== Origins ====
Róża Luksemburg, actual birth name Rozalia Luksenburg, was born on 5 March 1871 at 45 Ogrodowa Street (now 7a Kościuszko Street)<ref name="rory" /> in Zamość.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/l/u.htm#luxemburg|title=Glossary of People: L|website=Marxists.org|access-date=22 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matrikel.uzh.ch/suche/search?cmd=D&theSame=13056&name=Luxemburg+Rosa|title=Matrikeledition|website=Matrikel.uzh.ch|access-date=22 February 2018|archive-date=6 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200206123408/http://www.matrikel.uzh.ch/suche/search?cmd=D&theSame=13056&name=Luxemburg+Rosa|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Luxemburg family were [[History of Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] living in the [[Congress Poland|Russian sector of Poland]], after the country was [[partitions of Poland|partitioned]] by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Habsburg monarchy|Austria]] almost a century earlier. She was the fifth and youngest child of Edward Eliasz Luxemburg and Lina Löwenstein. Her father Edward, like his father Abraham, supported the Jewish Reform movement. Luxemburg later stated that her father imparted an interest in [[liberalism|liberal]] ideas to her while her mother was religious and well-read with books kept at home.<ref name="Merrick">{{cite web|title=Rosa Luxemburg: A Socialist With a Human Face|last=Merrick|first=Beverly G.|work=Center for Digital Discourse and Culture at Virginia Tech University|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/feminism/Luxemburg.html|date=1998|access-date=18 May 2015|archive-date=2 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402161631/https://www.cddc.vt.edu/feminism/Luxemburg.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The family moved to Warsaw in 1873.<ref name="nettl" /> Polish and [[German language|German]] were spoken at home; Luxemburg also learned [[Russian language|Russian]].<ref name="Merrick"/> Although over time she became fluent in Russian and [[French language|French]], Polish remained Róża's first language with German also spoken at a native level.<ref name="tych5" /><ref name="winkler" /><ref name="sprawaPL" /> Rosa was considered intelligent early on, writing letters to her family and impressing her relatives with recitals of poetry, including the Polish classic ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''.<ref name="rory" />

Rory Castle writes: "From her grandfather and father [Rosa] inherited the belief that she was a Pole first and a Jew second, her passionate opposition to Tsarism and her emotional connection to Polish language and culture. Although her parents were religious, they did not consider themselves to be Jewish by nationality, rather 'Poles of the Mosaic persuasion{{'"}}.<ref name="rory" /> He also points out that more recent research into the Luxemburg family and her early years show that "Rosa Luxemburg gained a lot more from her family than has previously been understood by her biographers. Not only in terms of her education, financial support and assistance during her frequent incarcerations, but also in terms of her identity and politics. Her family was a closely knitted support network, even when its members were spread out across Europe. This solid foundation, which supported and encouraged her at every step, gave Luxemburg the intellectual and personal confidence to go out and attempt to change the world".<ref name="rory" /> It is especially from Luxemburg's private correspondence that it can be seen she in fact remained very close with her family throughout the years, despite being separated by borders and spread out across countries.<ref name="rory" />

==== Education and activism ====

She began political activities by organising a [[general strike]]; as a result, four of the Proletariat Party leaders were put to death and the party was disbanded, though the remaining members, including Luxemburg, kept meeting in secret. In 1887, she passed her [[matura]] ([[secondary school]] examinations).

In 1893, with Leo Jogiches and [[Julian Marchlewski]] (alias Julius Karski), Luxemburg founded the newspaper {{lang|pl|Sprawa Robotnicza}} (''The Workers' Cause'') which opposed the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] policies of the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. Luxemburg believed that an independent Poland could arise and exist only through socialist revolutions in Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia. She maintained that the struggle should be against [[capitalism]], not just for Polish independence. Her position of denying a national right of [[self-determination]] provoked a philosophic disagreement with [[Vladimir Lenin]]. She and Leo Jogiches co-founded the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] (SDKPiL) party, after merging Congress Poland's and Lithuania's social democratic organisations. Despite living in Germany for most of her adult life, Luxemburg was the principal theoretician of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland (SDKP, later the SDKPiL) and led the party in a partnership with Jogiches, its principal organiser.<ref name="tych2" /> She remained sentimental towards Polish culture, her favourite poet was [[Adam Mickiewicz]], and she vehemently opposed the [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanisation of Poles]] in the [[Prussian Partition]]; in 1900 she published a brochure against this in [[Poznań]].<ref name="tych5">{{cite book|last=Tych|first=Feliks|date=2018|editor-last=Wielgosz|editor-first=Przemysław|title=O rewolucji: 1905, 1917|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy "Książka i Prasa"|page=18|chapter=Przedmowa|isbn=978-8365304599}}</ref> Earlier, in 1893, she also wrote against the Russification of Poles by the Russian Empire's absolutist government.<ref name="sprawaPL">{{cite journal|last1=Luksemburg|first1=Róża|date=July 1893|title=O wynaradawianiu (Z powodu dziesięciolecia rządów jen.-gub.

==== The 1905 revolution ====
{{see also|Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905–1907)|1905 Russian Revolution}}
After the [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905–1907)|1905 revolution]] broke out, against the advice of her Polish and German comrades, Luxemburg left for Warsaw. If she were to be recognised, tsarist authorities would imprison her, but the October/November political strike, part of the [[1905 Russian Revolution|upheaval in Russia]] with particularly active elements in Congress Poland, convinced Róża that she was needed in Warsaw instead of Berlin.<ref name="tych3">{{cite book|last=Tych|first=Feliks|date=2018|editor-last=Wielgosz|editor-first=Przemysław|title=O rewolucji: 1905, 1917|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy "Książka i Prasa"|page=15|chapter=Przedmowa|isbn=978-8365304599}}</ref> She arrived there on 30 December thanks to her German friend Anna Matschke's passport and met up with Jogiches, who had returned to Warsaw a month earlier also on a false passport; they lived together in a [[Pension (lodging)|pension]] at the corner of Jasna and Świętokrzyska streets, from where they wrote for the SDKPiL's illegally published paper {{lang|pl|Czerwony Sztandar}} (The Red Banner).<ref>{{cite book|last=Tych|first=Feliks|date=2018|editor-last=Wielgosz|editor-first=Przemysław|title=O rewolucji: 1905, 1917|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy "Książka i Prasa"|page=16|chapter=Przedmowa|isbn=978-8365304599}}</ref> Luxemburg was one of the first writers to notice the 1905 revolution's potential for democratisation within the Russian Empire. In the years 1905-1906 alone, she made in Polish and German over 100 articles, brochures, appeals, texts, and speeches about the revolution.<ref name="tych3" /> Although only the closest friends and comrades of Jogiches and Luxemburg knew of their return to the country, the [[Okhrana]], thanks to a [[mole (espionage)|mole]] recruited by the tsarist authorities within the senior SDKPiL leadership, came to arrest them on 4 March 1906.<ref name="tych4">{{cite book|last=Tych|first=Feliks|date=2018|editor-last=Wielgosz|editor-first=Przemysław|title=O rewolucji: 1905, 1917|publisher=Instytut Wydawniczy "Książka i Prasa"|page=17|chapter=Przedmowa|isbn=978-8365304599}}</ref>

They held her prisoner first at the [[ratusz]] jail, then at [[Pawiak prison]] and later at the Tenth Pavilion of the [[Warsaw Citadel]]. Luxemburg continued to write for the SDKPiL in secret while in custody, with her works smuggled out of the compound.<ref name="tych4" /> After two officers of the Okhrana were bribed by her relatives, a temporary release on bail was secured for her on 28 June 1906 for health reasons until the court trial;<ref name="winkler" /> in early August from [[Saint Petersburg]], she left for [[Repino, Saint Petersburg|Kuokkala]], which was then part of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] (an autonomous part of the Russian Empire). From there, in the middle of September, she managed to secretly flee to Germany.<ref name="tych4" />

[[File:RLuxemburgCpWz.jpg|thumb|Luxemburg {{circa|1895–1900}}]]

Luxemburg wanted to move to Germany to be at the centre of the party struggle, but she had no way of obtaining permission to remain there indefinitely. Thus, in April 1897 she married the son of an old friend, Gustav Lübeck, in order to gain German citizenship. They never lived together, and they formally divorced five years later.<ref>Waters, p. 12.</ref> She returned briefly to [[Paris]], then moved permanently to Berlin to support [[Eduard Bernstein]]'s constitutional reform movement. Luxemburg disliked the middle-class culture of Berlin, which she considered stifling to revolution. She further disliked [[Prussia]]n men and resented what she saw as the grip of urban capitalism on [[social democracy]].<ref>Nettl, p. 383; Waters, p. 13.</ref> In the [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party of Germany]]'s women's section, she met [[Clara Zetkin]], whom she made a lifelong friend. Between 1907 and his conscription in 1915, she was involved in a love affair with Clara's younger son, [[Kostja Zetkin]], to which approximately 600 surviving letters (now mostly published) bear testimony.<ref name=hingfetscher>{{cite news|title=Selbst im Gefängnis Trost für andere|newspaper=Die Zeit |url=http://www.zeit.de/1984/41/selbst-im-gefaengnis-trost-fuer-andere/komplettansicht|date=5 October 1984| volume=41/1984| publisher=[[Die Zeit]] (online)|access-date=12 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=RLBriefelautStichting>{{cite web|title=Heute war mir Dein süßer Brief ein solcher Trost|url=https://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/Themen/Rosa_Luxemburg/rosa24-35.pdf#31|page=31|publisher=Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung Gesellschaftsanalyse und politische Bildung e. V., Berlin|access-date=12 September 2017}}</ref><ref>''Rosa Luxemburg: Gesammelte Briefe''. Vol. 2, 5 and 6.</ref> Luxemburg was a member of the uncompromising left wing of the SPD. Their clear position was that the objectives of liberation for the industrial [[working class]] and all [[Minority group|minorities]] could be achieved by revolution only.

As [[Irene Gammel]] writes in a review of the English translation of the book in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'': "The three decades covered by the 230 letters in this collection provide the context for her major contributions as a political [[Activism|activist]], [[Socialism|socialist]] theorist and writer". Her reputation was tarnished by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s cynicism in ''Questions Concerning the History of Bolshevism''. In his rewriting of Russian events, he placed the blame for the theory of [[permanent revolution]] on Luxemburg's shoulders, with faint praise for her attacks on [[Karl Kautsky]] which she commenced in 1910.<ref>Waters, p. 20.</ref>

According to Gammel, "In her controversial tome of 1913, ''The Accumulation of Capital'', as well as through her work as a co-founder of the radical [[Spartacus League]], Luxemburg helped to shape Germany's young democracy by advancing an international, rather than a nationalist, outlook. This farsightedness partly explains her remarkable popularity as a socialist icon and its continued resonance in movies, novels and memorials dedicated to her life and oeuvre". Gammel also notes that for Luxemburg "the revolution was a way of life" and yet that the letters also challenge the stereotype of "Red Rosa" as a ruthless fighter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/the-letters-of-rosa-luxemburg-translated-by-george-shriver/article574948/ |title=The Letters of Rosa Luxemburg, translated by George Shriver |date=25 March 2011 |access-date=5 March 2024 |first=Irene |last=Gammel |work=Globe and Mail }}</ref> However, ''The Accumulation of Capital'' sparked angry accusations from the [[Communist Party of Germany]]. In 1923, [[Ruth Fischer]] and [[Arkadi Maslow]] denounced the work as "errors", a derivative work of economic miscalculation known as "spontaneity".<ref>Waters, p. 19.</ref>

Luxemburg continued to identify as Polish and disliked living in Germany, which she saw as a political necessity, making various negative comments about [[German culture]] during the German Empire in her private correspondence that was written in Polish; at the same time, she loved the works of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and showed an appreciation for [[German literature]]. However, she also preferred Switzerland to Berlin and greatly missed Polish language and [[Polish culture|culture]].<ref name="rauba">{{cite web|url=http://www.1917.net.pl/node/6533|title=Ryszard Rauba: Wątek niemiecki w zapomnianej korespondencji Róży Luksemburg|last=Rauba|first=Ryszard|date=2011-09-28|website=1917.net|publisher=Instytut Politologii, Uniwersytet Zielonogórski|access-date=2021-07-25}}</ref><ref name="damian">{{cite web|url=https://histmag.org/Prawdziwe-oblicze-Rozy-Luksemburg-20512|title=Prawdziwe oblicze Róży Luksemburg?|last=Winczewski|first=Damian|date=2020-04-18|website=histmag.org|access-date=2021-07-25}}</ref>

==== Before World War I ====
When Luxemburg moved to Germany in May 1898, she settled in Berlin. She was active there in the left wing of the SPD in which she sharply defined the border between the views of her faction and the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism theory]] of Eduard Bernstein. She attacked him in her brochure ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'', released in September 1898. Luxemburg's rhetorical skill made her a leading spokesperson in denouncing the SPD's [[Reformism|reformist]] parliamentary course. She argued that the critical difference between [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Labour economics|labour]] could only be countered if the [[proletariat]] assumed [[Power (social and political)|power]] and effected [[revolution]]ary changes in [[methods of production]]. She wanted the revisionists ousted from the SPD. That did not occur, but Kautsky's leadership retained a Marxist influence on its programme.<ref>Weitz, Eric D. (1994). "'Rosa Luxemburg Belongs to Us!'". German Communism and the Luxemburg Legacy. ''Central European History'' (27: 1), pp. 27–64.</ref>

From 1900, Luxemburg published analyses of contemporary European socio-economic problems in newspapers. Foreseeing war, she vigorously attacked what she saw as German [[militarism]] and [[imperialism]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Kate Evans, ''Red Rosa: A Graphic Biography of Rosa Luxemburg'', New York, Verso, 2015</ref> Luxemburg wanted a general strike to rouse the workers to solidarity and prevent the coming war. However, the SPD leaders refused and she broke with Kautsky in 1910. Between 1904 and 1906, she was imprisoned for her political activities on three occasions in [[Barnimstrasse women's prison]].<ref>Weitz, Eric D. (1997). ''Creating German Communism, 1890–1990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.</ref> In 1907, she went to the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Russian Social Democrats]]' Fifth Party Day in [[London]], where she met Lenin. At the socialist [[Second International]] Congress in [[Stuttgart]], her [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] demanding that all European workers' parties should unite in attempting to stop the war was accepted.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Luxemburg taught Marxism and economics at the SPD's Berlin training centre. Her former student [[Friedrich Ebert]] became the SPD leader and later the [[Weimar Republic]]'s first President. In 1912, Luxemburg was the SPD representative at the European Socialists' congresses.<ref name="ReferenceB">Paul Frölich, ''Rosa Luxemburg'', London: Haymarket Books, 2010</ref> With French socialist [[Jean Jaurès]], Luxemburg argued that European workers' parties should organise a general strike when war broke out. In 1913, she told a large meeting: "If they think we are going to lift the weapons of murder against our French and other brethren, then we shall shout: 'We will not do it!{{'"}} However, when nationalist crises in the [[Balkans]] erupted into violence and then the war in 1914, there was no general strike and the SPD majority supported the war as did the [[French Section of the Workers' International|French Socialists]]. The [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] unanimously agreed to finance the war. The SPD voted in favour of that and agreed to a truce ({{lang|de|[[Burgfriedenspolitik|Burgfrieden]]}}) with the Imperial government and promised that SPD-controlled [[labour union]]s would refrain from [[strike action]] for the duration of the war. This led Luxemburg to contemplate suicide as the revisionism she had fought since 1899 had triumphed.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

In response, Luxemburg organised anti-war demonstrations in [[Frankfurt]], calling for [[Conscientious objector|conscientious objection]] to [[Conscription|military conscription]] and the refusal of soldiers to follow orders. On that account, she was imprisoned for a year for "inciting to disobedience against the authorities' law and order".

==== During the war ====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-14077-006, Rosa Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|Luxemburg in 1915]]

In August 1914, Luxemburg, along with [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Clara Zetkin]], and [[Franz Mehring]], founded the group {{lang|de|Die Internationale}} ("The International"), which became the Spartacus League in January 1916. They wrote and distributed illegal anti-war pamphlets [[pseudonym]]ously signed [[Spartacus]], after the slave-liberating [[Thrace|Thracian]] [[gladiator]] who led an uprising against the Roman Republic. Luxemburg's pseudonym was Junius, after [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], the founder of the [[Roman Republic]]. The Spartacus League vehemently rejected the SPD's support in the Reichstag for funding [[World War I|the war]] and urged Germany's [[labor union]]s to declare an anti-war general strike. As a result, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were imprisoned in June 1916 for two and a half years. During imprisonment, Luxemburg was twice relocated, first to Posen (now Poznań), then to Breslau (now [[Wrocław]]).

Luxemburg continued to write and friends secretly smuggled out and illegally published her articles. Among them was ''[[The Russian Revolution (pamphlet)|Die Russische Revolution]]'', criticising the [[Bolsheviks]] and accusing them of seeking to impose a [[totalitarian]] [[single party state]] upon the Soviet Union. In that context, she wrote her famous pronouncement on [[freedom of expression]] "Freedom is always the freedom of dissenters" ({{lang|de|"Freiheit ist immer Freiheit der Andersdenkenden"}}) in criticizing Lenin and the Russian Revolution.<ref name=freedom>{{cite web | url=https://www.rosalux.de/en/foundation/historical-centre-for-democratic-socialism-1/rosa-luxemburg/frequently-asked-questions-about-rosa-luxemburg | title=Frequently Asked Questions about Rosa Luxemburg - Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung }}</ref> She added: "The public life of countries with limited freedom is so poverty-stricken, so miserable, so rigid, so unfruitful, precisely because, through the exclusion of democracy, it cuts off the living sources of all spiritual riches and progress".<ref>[https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1918/russian-revolution/ch06.htm "The Russian Revolution, Chapter 6: The Problem of Dictatorship"]. Marxists.org. Retrieved 5 February 2017.</ref> Another article written in April 1915 when in prison and published and distributed illegally in June 1916 originally under the pseudonym ''Junius'' was {{lang|de|Die Krise der Sozialdemokratie}} (''The Crisis of Social Democracy''), also known as the {{lang|de|Junius-Broschüre}} or ''[[Junius Pamphlet|The Junius Pamphlet]]''.<ref>[http://mlwerke.de/lu/luf.htm "Die Krise der Sozialdemokratie (Junius-Broschüre)"].</ref>

In 1917, the Spartacus League was affiliated with the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]] (USPD), founded by [[Hugo Haase]] and made up of anti-war former SPD members.

According to Russian historian [[Edvard Radzinsky]], "The Bolshevik envoy in Berlin began secretly purchasing arms for the German revolutionaries. A little while ago the Germans had been assisting revolution in Russia. Now Lenin was reciprocating. The Bolshevik embassy became the headquarters of the German revolution."<ref>Edvard Radzinsky (1996), ''[[Stalin (Radzinsky book)|Stalin: The First In-Depth Biography Based on Explosive Documents from Russia's Secret Archive]]'', Anchor Books. p. 158.</ref>

In November 1918, the USPD and the SPD initially shared power in the [[Council of the People's Deputies]], the revolutionary government set up following the 9 November [[abdication]] of Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Altmann |first=Gerhard |date=11 April 2000 |title=Der Rat der Volksbeauftragten |trans-title=Council of the People's Deputies |url=https://www.dhm.de/lemo/kapitel/weimarer-republik/revolution-191819/rat-der-volksbeauftragten.html |access-date=1 May 2024 |website=Deutsches Historisches Museum |language=de}}</ref> This took place during the early days of the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German Revolution]] that began with the [[Kiel mutiny]], which sparked the establishment of [[German workers' and soldiers' councils 1918–1919|workers' and soldiers' councils]] across most of Germany to put an end to World War I and to the [[German Emperor|monarchy]]. The SPD leaders tried to prevent the establishment of a {{lang|de|Räterepublik}} (council republic) like the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] of the Russian [[Revolution of 1905|Revolutions of 1905]] and [[October Revolution|1917]] by pushing for early elections to a [[constituent assembly]] to determine Germany's future form of government. Only a small minority of the councils supported a soviet-style system.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Scriba |first=Arnulf |date=15 August 2015 |title=Arbeiter- und Soldatenräte |trans-title=Workers' and Soldiers' Councils |url=https://www.dhm.de/lemo/kapitel/weimarer-republik/revolution-191819/arbeiter-und-soldatenraete.html |access-date=28 February 2024 |website=Deutsches Historisches Museum |language=de}}</ref>

Luxemburg was freed from prison in Breslau on 8 November 1918, three days before the [[armistice of 11 November 1918]]. One day later, Karl Liebknecht, who had also been freed from prison, proclaimed the Free Socialist Republic ({{lang|de|Freie Sozialistische Republik}}) in Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Long Live the Republic – 9 November 1918|last=von Hellfeld|first=Matthias|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|url=http://www.dw.de/long-live-the-republic-november-9-1918/a-4746952|date=16 November 2009|access-date=30 November 2014}}</ref> He and Luxemburg reorganised the Spartacus League and founded ''The Red Flag'' ({{lang|de|Die Rote Fahne}}) newspaper, demanding amnesty for all [[political prisoner]]s and the abolition of [[capital punishment]] in the essay ''Against Capital Punishment''.<ref name="Merrick"/> On 14 December 1918, they published the new programme of the Spartacus League.

Following the arrival of Soviet emissary and [[military advisor]] [[Karl Radek]], between 29 and 31 December 1918 a joint congress of the League, independent socialists and the International Communists of Germany (IKD) took place with Radek's involvement. During the conference, Luxemburg continued to denounce the [[Red Terror]] and [[Censorship in Russia|censorship in the Soviet Russia]]. She also accused both Lenin and the Bolsheviks of having [[police state]] aspirations. She further expressed shame that her former colleague and friend, [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], had agreed to head the [[CHEKA|Cheka]], the then Soviet security agency, and asked Radek to convey her opinions about all these matters to the [[Politburo]] in Moscow.<ref> Robert Service (2012), ''Spies and Commissars: The Early Years of the Russian Revolution'', Public Affairs Books. pp. 171–173.</ref>

This same conference, however, ultimately led to the foundation on 1 January 1919 of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) under the leadership of Liebknecht and Luxemburg. Luxemburg supported the new KPD's participation in the [[Weimar National Assembly]] that founded the Weimar Republic, but she was out-voted and the KPD boycotted the elections.<ref>Luban, Ottokar (2017).

London: Lawrence & Wishart. pp. 45–65.</ref>

Leading up to the January 1919 struggle for power with the SPD, the improvised [[Spartacist uprising|Spartacist Uprising]] began in Berlin. Luxemburg spoke at the founding conference of the German Communist Party on 31 December 1918:

<blockquote>The progress of large-scale capitalist development during seventy years has brought us so far that today we can seriously set about destroying capitalism once and for all. No, still more; today we are not only in a position to perform this task, its performance is not only a duty toward the proletariat, but its solution offers the only means of saving human society from destruction.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Luxemburg |first1=Rosa |editor1-last=Hudis |editor1-first=Peter |editor2-last=Anderson |editor2-first=Kevin B. |chapter=Our Program and the Political Situation |title=The Rosa Luxemburg Reader |date=2004 |publisher=Monthly Review |pages=364}}</ref></blockquote>

Like Liebknecht, Luxemburg supported the violent {{lang|de|putsch}} attempt.{{sfn|Jones|2016|p=193}} In a complete reversal of her previous demands for "unrestricted [[freedom of the press]]",<ref name="marxists.org">{{cite book|author-first=Rosa |author-last=Luxemburg |chapter-url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1918/russian-revolution/ch06.htm |title=The Russian Revolution |chapter=The Problem of Dictatorship |orig-date=1918 |publisher=Workers Age Publishers |location=New York |date=1940 |translator-first=Bertram |translator-last=Wolfe}}</ref> ''The Red Flag'' called for the KPD to violently occupy the editorial offices of the anti-Spartacist press and later, all other positions of power.{{sfn|Jones|2016|p=193}} On 8 January, Luxemburg's ''Red Flag'' printed a public statement by her, in which she called for [[Revolutionary terror|revolutionary violence]] and no negotiations with the revolution's "mortal enemies", the SPD-led [[Republicanism|Republican]] Government of Friedrich Ebert and [[Philipp Scheidemann]].{{sfn|Jones|2016|pp=193–194}}

== Execution and aftermath ==
In response to the uprising, Luxemburg's former student, German Chancellor and SPD leader Ebert ordered the {{lang|de|[[Freikorps]]}} to suppress the Soviet-backed attempt at revolution, which was successfully crushed by 11 January 1919.{{sfn|Jones|2016|p=210}} Meanwhile, Luxemburg's ''Red Flag'' falsely claimed that the rebellion was spreading across Germany.{{sfn|Jones|2016|p=203}}

Luxemburg and Liebknecht were taken prisoner in Berlin on 15 January 1919 by the [[Guards Cavalry Division (German Empire)#Guard Cavalry Schützen Division|Guards Cavalry Rifle Division]] of the {{lang|de|Freikorps}} ({{lang|de|Garde-Kavallerie-Schützendivision}}).<ref name="Der Spiegel">{{cite news|title=Revolutionary Find: Berlin Hospital May Have Found Rosa Luxemburg's Corpse|last=Thadeusz|first=Frank|magazine=[[Der Spiegel]]|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/revolutionary-find-berlin-hospital-may-have-found-rosa-luxemburg-s-corpse-a-627626.html|date=29 May 2009|access-date=30 November 2014}}</ref> The unit's [[officer commanding]], Captain [[Waldemar Pabst]], with Lieutenant [[Horst von Pflugk-Harttung]], questioned them under torture and then, following an alleged telephone call to Defense Minister [[Gustav Noske]], issued orders to [[Summary execution|summarily execute]] both prisoners.

His body, without any identification, was then dumped outside the railings of the [[Berlin Zoo]]. According to historian [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]]:

<blockquote>The symbolism was intentional. The enemies of the Spartacists looked on them as being less than human. Dogs were being given a dog's death. The Spartacists leaders met their ends with courage and dignity. Of their leaders, only Thalheimer and Levi survived, and it was Levi who delivered the funeral oration for Luxemburg on 2 February.

That is why future victories will spring from this "defeat".

"Order prevails in Berlin!" You foolish lackeys! Your "order" is built on sand. Tomorrow the revolution will "rise up again, clashing its weapons," and to your horror it will proclaim with trumpets blazing: I was, I am, I shall be!}}

The executions of Luxemburg and Liebknecht were the beginning of a new wave of [[paramilitary]] warfare in Berlin and across Germany. Thousands of members of the KPD as well as other revolutionaries and civilians were killed, often as [[collateral damage]]. Finally, the People's Navy Division ({{lang|de|Volksmarinedivision}}) and workers' and soldiers' unions, which had moved to the political [[far left]], were disbanded.<ref name="Waters, pp. 18–19">Waters, pp. 18–19.</ref>

The last part of the German Revolution saw many instances of armed violence and strike action throughout Germany. Significant strikes occurred in Berlin, the [[Bremen Soviet Republic]], [[Saxony]], [[Saxe-Gotha]], Hamburg, the [[Rhineland]]s and the [[Ruhr]] region. Last to strike was the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] which was suppressed on 2 May 1919.

More than four months after the murders of Luxemburg and Liebknecht, on 1 June 1919, Luxemburg's corpse was found and identified after an autopsy at the [[Charité]] hospital in Berlin.<ref name="Der Spiegel" />

According to Russian historian Edvard Radzinsky, Soviet Premier Lenin retaliated for Liebknecht and Luxemburg's murder by issuing orders to [[Gregory Zinoviev]] for the immediate arrest and summary execution of four [[Grand Duke]]s from the recently deposed [[House of Romanov]], all of whom were uncles of the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], the last Tsar. Despite the pleas of [[Maxim Gorky]] on behalf of one of the condemned, the known progressive and noted historian [[Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Nikolai Mikhailovich]], all four men including Mikhailovich were shot on 30 January 1919 at the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] in [[Petrograd]].<ref>Edvard Radzinsky (1996), ''[[Stalin (Radzinsky book)|Stalin: The First In-Depth Biography Based on Explosive Documents from Russia's Secret Archive]]'', Anchor Books. pp. 158–159.</ref> The other three men executed were the [[Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia (1863–1919)|Grand Duke George Mikhailovich]], the [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich]], and the [[Grand Duke Dmitri Konstantinovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Constantinovich]].

Private Runge was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for attempted [[manslaughter]] and Lieutenant Vogel to two years and four months for failing to report a corpse. However, Vogel escaped after a brief period in custody, with the help of [[Wilhelm Canaris]]. Captain Pabst and Lieutenant Souchon were never prosecuted.<ref>Nettl, J. P. (1969). ''Rosa Luxemburg''. Oxford University Press. pp. 487–490.</ref> The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] later compensated Private Runge for having been jailed, but he died in Berlin in [[NKVD]] custody after the end of [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv5n1/luxembrg.htm|title=Martyrdom of Liebknecht and Luxemburg|website=Revolutionarydemocracy.org|access-date=22 February 2018}}</ref> The Nazis also later merged the {{lang|de|Garde-Kavallerie-Schützendivision}} into the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]. In an interview with German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in 1962 and again in his memoirs, Captain Pabst alleged that Defence Minister Noske and Weimar Republic Chancellor Ebert had both covertly approved of his actions, but his account has not been confirmed, nor has his case been examined by the Parliament or Courts of Germany. In 1993, Gietinger's research on his access to the previously restricted papers of Pabst, held at the Federal Military Archives, found him as central to the planning of the murder of Luxemburg and the shielding of those who had acted under his orders from subsequent criminal prosecution.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gietinger |first=Klaus |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1089197675 |title=The murder of Rosa Luxemburg |date=2019 |others=Loren Balhorn |isbn=978-1-78873-449-3 |location=London |oclc=1089197675}}</ref>

=== Reactions ===
Shortly after Luxemburg's death, her fame was alluded to by [[Grigory Zinoviev]] at the [[Petrograd Soviet]] on 18 January 1919, supporting her assessment of Bolshevism.<ref name="Waters, pp. 18–19" />

Lenin posthumously praised Luxemburg as an "eagle" of the working class, and stated that her work would serve as an example to other socialist revolutionaries.<ref>{{cite web |author-last=Larsen |author-first=Patrick |date=15 January 2009 |title=Ninety Years after the Murder of Rosa Luxemburg: Lessons of the Life of a Revolutionary |url=http://www.marxist.com/lessons-of-the-life-of-a-revolutionary.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210929142612/http://www.marxist.com/lessons-of-the-life-of-a-revolutionary.htm |archive-date=29 September 2021 |access-date=18 May 2015 |work=[[Revolutionary Communist International|International Marxist Tendency]]}}</ref>

But all the more imperious therefore becomes our duty to shield Rosa's memory from Stalin's calumny that has been caught by the hired functionaries of both hemispheres, and to pass on this truly beautiful, heroic, and tragic image to the young generations of the proletariat in all its grandeur and inspirational force".<ref>{{cite web |author-last=Trotsky |author-first=Leon |author-link=Leon Trotsky |date=June 1932 |title=Hands Off Rosa Luxemburg! |url=http://www.marxist.com/hands-off-rosa-luxemburg-1932.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210929143549/http://www.marxist.com/hands-off-rosa-luxemburg-1932.htm |archive-date=29 September 2021 |access-date=18 May 2015 |work=[[Revolutionary Communist International|International Marxist Tendency]]}}</ref>

===Annual demonstration===
In the city of Berlin a {{lang|de|Liebknecht-Luxemburg-Demonstration}}, shortened to {{lang|de|LL-Demo}}, is organised annually in the month of January around the date of their death. This demonstration takes place on the second weekend of the month in [[Friedrichshain|Berlin-Friedrichshain]], starting near the [[Frankfurter Tor]] and then to their graves in the central cemetery [[Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde|Friedrichsfelde]], also known as the {{lang|de|Gedenkstätte der Sozialisten}} (Socialist Memorial).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xhain.info/termine/liebknecht-luxemburg-demo.htm|title=Liebknecht-Luxemburg-Demonstration|first=Rene|last=Meintz|date=13 January 2019|website=Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg-Portal}}</ref> In [[East Germany]], the event was widely considered to be a mere show for [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] politicians and celebrities, which was broadcast live on state television.<ref>[https://www.jugendopposition.de/themen/145392/luxemburg-liebknecht-demonstration "Luxemburg-Liebknecht-Demonstration"].

During the [[Peaceful Revolution]], the annual parade in [[East Berlin]] honoring the deaths of Liebknecht and Luxemburg was used by East German [[dissidents]] as part of their campaign, "to raise their unwelcome demands at embarrassing moments for the regime". On 17 January 1988, as Premier [[Erich Honecker]] was reviewing the parade, a group of dissidents broke through the ranks of the [[Free German Youth]] and unfurled banners bearing an infamous dictum from ''Die Russische Revolution'', Rosa Luxemburg's book-length denunciation of both [[authoritarian socialism]] and [[censorship in the Soviet Union]], ''"Freiheit ist immer Freiheit der Andersdenkenden"'' ("Freedom is always the freedom of dissenters").<ref name=freedom/> Viewers of the parade were then subjected to the ironic sight of East German [[Stasi]] agents beating and arresting anyone who brandished the slogan.<ref>David Clay Large (2000), ''Berlin'', Basic Books. p. 520.</ref>

=== Revolutionary Socialist Democracy and Criticism of the October Revolution ===
[[File:Spdparteischule1907.jpg|thumb|Luxemburg (fourth from left against bookcase) among attendees at the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] party school in 1907]]

Luxemburg initially professed a commitment to democracy and the necessity of revolution. Luxemburg's idea of democracy which [[Stanley Aronowitz]] calls "''generalized'' democracy in an unarticulated form" represents Luxemburg's greatest break with "mainstream communism" since it effectively diminishes the role of the [[communist party]], but it, similar to the views of [[Karl Marx]], states that the working class must "emancipate" themselves without a higher authority.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hudis |first=Leter |date=2022-09-21 |title=Rosa Luxemburg Was the Great Theorist of Democratic Revolution - Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung |url=https://www.rosalux.de/en/news/id/47060/rosa-luxemburg-was-the-great-theorist-of-democratic-revolution |access-date=2024-10-21 |website=www.rosalux.de |language=en-US}}</ref>

Early on, Luxemburg attacked the [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] tendencies present in the [[Russian Revolution]] claiming that without democratic institutions and protections, "life dies out in every public institution" and further claimed that such a lack of freedoms would lead to a "dictatorship of a handful of politicians".<ref name="marxists.org"/>

<blockquote>Freedom only for the supporters of the government, only for the members of one party – however numerous they may be – is no freedom at all. Freedom is always and exclusively freedom for the one who thinks differently. Not because of any fanatical concept of "justice" but because all that is instructive, wholesome and purifying in political freedom depends on this essential characteristic, and its effectiveness vanishes when "freedom" becomes a special privilege. [...] But socialist democracy is not something which begins only in the promised land after the foundations of socialist economy are created; it does not come as some sort of Christmas present for the worthy people who, in the interim, have loyally supported a handful of socialist dictators. Socialist democracy begins simultaneously with the beginnings of the destruction of class rule and of the construction of socialism.</blockquote>

In an article published just before the October Revolution, Luxemburg characterised the Russian [[February Revolution]] of 1917 as a "revolution of the proletariat" and said that the "[[Classical liberalism|liberal]] [[bourgeoisie]]" were pushed to movement by the display of "proletarian power". The task of the Russian proletariat, she explained, was now to end the "imperialist" world war in addition to struggling against the "imperialist bourgeoisie". The world war made Russia ripe for a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist revolution]]. Therefore, "the German proletariat are also [...] posed a question of honour, and a very fateful question".<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Luxemburg |author-first=Rosa |title=Collected Works |volume=2 |page=245 |chapter=The Politics of Mass Strikes and Unions}}</ref> However, in several works, including an essay written from jail and published posthumously by her last companion [[Paul Levi]] (publication of which precipitated his expulsion from the [[Communist International|Third International]]), titled ''The Russian Revolution'',<ref>{{cite web |date=11 July 2006 |title=The Nationalities Question in the Russian Revolution (Rosa Luxemburg, 1918) |url=http://libcom.org/library/nationalities-question-in-the-russian-revolution-luxemburg |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210115083740/http://libcom.org/library/nationalities-question-in-the-russian-revolution-luxemburg |archive-date=15 January 2021 |access-date=16 May 2021 |publisher=Libcom.org}}</ref> Luxemburg sharply criticised some Bolshevik policies such as their suppression of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918 following the October Revolution and their policy of supporting the purported right of all national peoples to self-determination. According to Luxemburg, the Bolsheviks' strategic mistakes created tremendous dangers for the Revolution such as its bureaucratisation. She wrote that the shortcomings of the October Revolution reflected a period of "complete failure of the international proletariat".<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Luxemburg |author-first=Rosa |title=Collected Works |volume=4 |page=334 |chapter=On the Russian Revolution }}</ref> Luxemburg further stated:<ref name=":1">{{cite magazine  |date=September 1918 |title=The Russian Tragedy |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1918/09/11.htm |magazine=Spartacus |access-date=29 November 2018 |number=11 |author-last=Luxemburg |author-first=Rosa}}</ref><blockquote>The awkward position that the Bolsheviks are in today, however, is, together with most of their mistakes, a consequence of basic insolubility of the problem posed to them by the international, above all the German, proletariat. To carry out the dictatorship of the proletariat and a socialist revolution in a single country surrounded by reactionary imperialist rule and in the fury of the bloodiest world war in human history – that is squaring the circle. Any socialist party would have to fail in this task and perish – whether or not it made self-renunciation the guiding star of its policies.</blockquote>Bolshevik theorists such as Lenin and Trotsky responded to this criticism by arguing that Luxemburg's notions were [[Classical Marxism|classical Marxist]] ones, but they could not be applied to Russia of 1917. They stated that the lessons of actual experience such as the confrontation with the bourgeois parties had forced them to revise the Marxian strategy. As part of this argument, it was pointed out that after Luxemburg herself got out of jail, she was also forced to confront the National Assembly in Germany, a step they compared with their own conflict with the Russian Constituent Assembly.<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Luxemburg |author-first=Rosa |title=Collected Works |volume=4 |page=366 |chapter=Fragment on War, National Questions, and Revolution }}</ref>

Following her observation of the October Revolution, Luxemburg claimed that it was the "historic responsibility" of the German workers to carry out a revolution for themselves and thereby end the war.<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Luxemburg |author-first=Rosa |title=Collected Works |volume=4 |page=374 |chapter=The Historic Responsibility g}}</ref> When the German Revolution began, Luxemburg immediately started to agitate for a social revolution<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Luxemburg |author-first=Rosa |title=Collected Works |volume=4 |page=397 |chapter=The Beginning }}</ref> which she claimed would mitigate the consequences of the Bolshevik revolution.<ref name=":1" />

According to Aronowitz, the vagueness of "Luxemburgian" democracy is one reason for its initial difficulty in gaining widespread support. Luxemburg herself clarified her position on democracy in her writings regarding the Russian Revolution and the [[Soviet Union]].{{citation needed|date=May 2023|reason=See discussion [[Talk:Rosa Luxemburg#Can't find quote]]}}

=== ''The Accumulation of Capital'' ===
[[File:Rosa Lux Berlin 1907.jpg|thumb|170px|Luxemburg at home with a book, 1907]]

''[[The Accumulation of Capital]]'' was the only work Luxemburg officially published on economics during her lifetime. In the polemic, she argued that capitalism needs to constantly expand into non-capitalist areas in order to access new supply sources, markets for surplus value and reservoirs of labour.<ref name="Reform or Revolution">{{cite book|author-last1=Luxemburg |author-first1=Rosa |contributor-last=Scott |contributor-first=Helen |contribution=Introduction to Rosa Luxemburg |title=The Essential Rosa Luxemburg: Reform or Revolution and The Mass Strike |url=https://archive.org/details/essentialrosalux00luxe |url-access=limited |date=2008 |publisher=Haymarket Books |location=Chicago |page=[https://archive.org/details/essentialrosalux00luxe/page/n14 18] |isbn=978-1931859363}}</ref> According to Luxemburg, Marx had made an error in {{lang|de|[[Das Kapital]]}} in that the proletariat could not afford to buy the commodities they produced and by his own criteria it was impossible for capitalists to make a profit in a closed-capitalist system since the demand for commodities would be too low and therefore much of the value of commodities could not be transformed into money. According to Luxemburg, capitalists sought to realise profits through offloading surplus commodities onto non-capitalist economies, hence the phenomenon of imperialism as capitalist states sought to dominate weaker economies. However, this was leading to the destruction of non-capitalist economies as they were increasingly absorbed into the capitalist system. With the destruction of non-capitalist economies, there would be no more markets to offload surplus commodities onto and capitalism would break down.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|title=Main Currents of Marxism |author-last=Kołakowski |author-first=Leszek |author-link=Leszek Kołakowski |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |year=2008 |pages=407–415}}</ref>

''The Accumulation of Capital'' was harshly criticised by both Marxist and non-Marxist economists on the grounds that her logic was circular in proclaiming the impossibility of realising profits in a close-capitalist system and that her [[Underconsumption#Marxian|underconsumptionist]] theory was too crude.<ref name=":0"/> Her conclusion that the limits of the capitalist system drive it to imperialism and war led Luxemburg to a lifetime of campaigning against militarism and colonialism.<ref name="Reform or Revolution"/>

=== ''Dialectic of Spontaneity and Organisation'' ===
[[File:LuxemburgSpeech.jpg|thumb|Luxemburg addressing a crowd in 1907]]

The ''Dialectic of Spontaneity and Organisation'' was the central feature of Luxemburg's political philosophy, wherein [[Revolutionary spontaneity|spontaneity]] is a [[grassroots]] approach to organising a [[Class conflict|class struggle]], and organisation is a top-down or [[Vanguardism|vanguardist]] approach to organising a class struggle. She argued that spontaneity and organisation are not separable or separate activities, but different moments of one political process as one does not exist without the other. These beliefs arose from her view that class struggle evolves from an elementary, spontaneous state to a democratic organisation.<ref>{{cite book|author-first=Rosa |author-last=Luxemburg |chapter=In a Revolutionary Hour: What Next? |title=Collected Works |volume=1 |number=2 |page=554}}</ref> Luxemburg developed the ''Dialectic of Spontaneity and Organisation'' under the influence of mass strikes in Europe, especially the Russian Revolution of 1905.<ref>{{Britannica|352345}}</ref> Unlike the social democratic orthodoxy of the Second International, she regarded the organisation of a socialist movement as a temporary means to worker enlightenment:

<blockquote>Social democracy is simply the embodiment of the modern proletariat's class struggle, a struggle which is driven by a consciousness of its own historic consequences. The masses are in reality their own leaders, dialectically creating their own development process. The more that social democracy develops, grows, and becomes stronger, the more the enlightened masses of workers will take their own destinies, the leadership of their movement, and the determination of its direction into their own hands.<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Luxemburg |author-first=Rosa |title=Collected Works |volume=2 |page=280 |chapter=The Political Leader of the German Working Classes }}</ref></blockquote>

She insisted on setting the class struggle in its historical context, writing "the modern proletarian class does not carry out its struggle according to a plan set out in some book or theory; the modern workers' struggle is a part of history, a part of social progress."<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Luxemburg |author-first=Rosa |title=Collected Works |volume=2 |page=465 |chapter=The Politics of Mass Strikes and Unions }}</ref>

In 1919, [[Bertolt Brecht]] wrote the poetic memorial ''Epitaph'' honouring Luxemburg and [[Kurt Weill]] set it to music in ''[[The Berlin Requiem (Weill)|The Berlin Requiem]]'' in 1928:

<blockquote><poem>Red Rosa now has vanished too,
And where she lies is hid from view.
She told the poor what life's about,
And so the rich have rubbed her out.
May she rest in peace.</poem></blockquote>

The famous Monument to Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, originally named Monument to the November Revolution ({{lang|de|Revolutionsdenkmal}}) which was designed by pioneering modernist and later [[Bauhaus]] director [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and built in 1926 in Berlin-Lichtenberg<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/MiesvanderRohe.Architecture/photos/?tab=album&album_id=61452845378|title=Mies van der Rohe|website=Facebook.com|access-date=22 February 2018}}</ref> and destroyed in 1935. The memorial took the form of a [[Suprematism|suprematist]] composition of brick masses. Van der Rohe said: "As most of these people [Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and other fallen heroes of the Revolution] were shot in front of a brick wall, a brick wall would be what I would build as a monument". The commission came about through the offices of [[Eduard Fuchs]], who showed a proposal featuring [[Doric order|Doric]] columns and medallions of Liebknecht and Luxemburg, prompting Mies' laughter and the comment "That would be a good monument for a banker". The monument was destroyed by the Nazis after they took power.

In 1951, Liebknecht and Luxemburg were honoured with symbolic graves at the ''Memorial to the Socialists'' ({{langx|de|Gedenkstätte der Sozialisten}}) in the Friedrichsfelde Cemetery.

In the former East Germany and East Berlin, various places were named for Luxemburg by the East German communist party. These include the [[Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz]] and a [[Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz (Berlin U-Bahn)|U-Bahn station]] which were located in East Berlin during the [[Cold War]].

An engraving on the nearby pavement reads "Ich war, ich bin, ich werde sein" ("I was, I am, I will be"). The [[Volksbühne]] (People's Theatre) is also on Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz.

Following the 1989 Peaceful Revolution and [[German reunification]], CDU delegates on the Berlin city council recommended renaming all streets and squares honoring Marx, [[August Bebel]], Liebknecht, Luxemburg and Clara Zetkin. In a rare moment of agreement, both [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]] and SPD delegates balked at this and the battle became so heated that an independent commission was appointed to advise on the question. The commission ultimately recommended the compromise, "that Communists who had died too soon to help bring Weimar down, or the GDR up, should not be purged". For this reason, both streets and squares in the former East Berlin continue to bear Rosa Luxemburg's name.<ref>David Clay Large (2000), ''Berlin'', Basic Books. pp. 560–561.</ref>

[[Dresden]] has a street and streetcar stop named after Luxemburg. The names remained unchanged after German reunification.

At the edge of the [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]] on the {{lang|de|Katharina-Heinroth-Ufer}} which runs between the southern bank of the Landwehr Canal and the bordering {{lang|de|Zoologischer Garten}} (Zoological Garden), a memorial has been installed by a private initiative. On the memorial, the name Rosa Luxemburg appears in raised capital letters, marking the spot where her body was thrown into the canal by {{lang|de|Freikorps}} troops.

The [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] notes that idolisation of Luxemburg and Liebknecht remains an important tradition of [[far-left]] extremism in the [[Federal Republic of Germany]].<ref name="Verfassungsschutz"/> During the Cold War, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were idolised as martyrs by East Germany's ruling Party and continue to be idolised by its successor party: [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]].<ref name="Verfassungsschutz"/>

[[Feminists]], Trotskyists, and other leftists in Germany especially show interest in Luxemburg's ideas. Distinguished modern Marxist thinkers such as [[Ernest Mandel]], who has even been characterised as Luxemburgist, have seen Luxemburg's thought as a corrective to traditional revolutionary theory.<ref>Achacar, Gilbert. [http://www.ernestmandel.org/en/aboutlife/txt/actuality_of_ernest_mandel.htm "The Actuality of Ernest Mandel"].</ref> In 2002, ten thousand people marched in Berlin for Luxemburg and Liebknecht and another 90,000 people laid [[carnation]]s on their graves.<ref>[http://www.workers.org/ww/2002/berlin0131.php "Workers World Jan. 31, 2002: Berlin events honor left-wing leaders"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105061518/http://www.workers.org/ww/2002/berlin0131.php|date=5 November 2012}}.</ref>

===Russia===
Opponents and critics of the far-left have often had a very different interpretation of Luxemburg's murder. Russian historian Edvard Radzinsky has gone on the record as a very harsh critic of the Soviet Government for spending so much money abroad to fund the efforts of those like Liebknecht and Luxemburg to covertly destabilise and overthrow the Weimar Republic and other Western Governments. In the Soviet Union during the same time, mass starvation was taking place as a result of the [[Russian Civil War]] (including the [[Russian famine of 1921]]). According to Radzinsky, "Starving [[Moscow]] was feeding the Communist Parties of the whole world. People were swollen with hunger, but never mind, the [[world revolution]] was at hand."<ref>Edvard Radzinsky (1996), ''[[Stalin (Radzinsky book)|Stalin: The First In-Depth Biography Based on Explosive Documents from Russia's Secret Archive]]'', Anchor Books. p. 182.</ref> Conversely, Stalin denounced Luxemburg posthumously in 1932 as a "[[Trotskyist]]".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=Isaac |title=The Prophet: The Life of Leon Trotsky |date=5 January 2015 |publisher=Verso Books |page=193}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Nettl |first1=J.

As [[Alexander Kerensky]] and the former Tsarist officer corps had fatally failed to unite for long enough to stop Lenin from seizing power in 1917, [[White émigré|anti-communist Russian refugees]] living in the Weimar Republic occasionally expressed envy for the success of the SPD and the {{lang|de|Freikorps}} in temporarily setting aside their political differences, even for just long enough to defeat the Spartacus Uprising, which was seen as an attempted German equivalent to the [[Bolshevik Revolution]].<ref name="Kessler 1990">[[Harry Graf Kessler|Kessler, Harry Graf]] (1990).

== Body identification controversy ==
[[File:Grab liebknecht luxemburg.jpg|thumb|1919 photo of the graves of Luxemburg and [[Karl Liebknecht]]]]
[[File:Berlin Friedrichsfelde Zentralfriedhof, Gedenkstätte der Sozialisten (Rondell) - Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|Grave of Rosa Luxemburg in Berlin]]
On 29 May 2009, ''Spiegel online'', the internet branch of the news magazine ''Der Spiegel'', reported the recently considered possibility that someone else's remains had mistakenly been identified as Luxemburg's and buried as hers.<ref name="Der Spiegel"/>

The [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] Michael Tsokos, head of the Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences at the Berlin Charité, discovered a preserved corpse lacking head, feet, or hands in the cellar of the Charité's medical history museum. He found the corpse's autopsy report suspicious and decided to perform a [[CT scan]] on the remains. The body showed signs of having been waterlogged at some point and the scans showed that it was the body of a woman of 40–50 years of age who suffered from [[osteoarthritis]] and had legs of differing length, as Luxemburg had. A laboratory in [[Kiel]] also tested the corpse using [[radiocarbon dating]] techniques and confirmed that it dated from the same period as Luxemburg's murder.

The original [[autopsy]], performed on 13 June 1919 on the body that was eventually buried at [[Friedrichsfelde]], showed certain inconsistencies that supported Tsokos' hypothesis. The autopsy explicitly noted an absence of hip damage and stated that there was no evidence that the legs were of different lengths. Additionally, the autopsy showed no traces on the upper skull of the two blows by rifle butt inflicted upon Luxemburg. Finally, while the 1919 examiners noted a hole in the corpse's head between the left eye and ear, they did not find an exit wound or the presence of a bullet within the skull.

Assistant pathologist Paul Fraenckel appeared to doubt at the time that the corpse he had examined was Luxemburg's and in a signed addendum distanced himself from his colleague's conclusions. This addendum and the inconsistencies between the autopsy report and the known facts persuaded Tsokos to examine the remains more closely. According to eyewitnesses, when Luxemburg's body was thrown into the canal, weights were wired to her ankles and wrists. These could have slowly severed her extremities in the months her corpse spent in the water which would explain the missing hands and feet issue.<ref name="Der Spiegel"/>

Tsokos realised that [[Genetic testing|DNA testing]] was the best way to confirm or deny the identity of the body as Luxemburg's. His team had initially hoped to find traces of the [[DNA]] on old postage stamps that Luxemburg had licked, but it transpired that Luxemburg had never done this, preferring to moisten stamps with a damp cloth. The examiners decided to look for a surviving blood relative and in July 2009 the German Sunday newspaper ''[[Bild|Bild am Sonntag]]'' reported that a great-niece of Luxemburg had been located{{snd}}a 79-year-old woman named Irene Borde. She donated strands of her hair for DNA comparison.<ref>{{cite news|title=DNA of Great-Niece May Help Identify Headless Corpse|publisher=SpiegelOnline|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,637385,00.html|date=21 July 2009|access-date=21 July 2009|newspaper=Spiegel Online}}</ref>

In December 2009, Berlin authorities seized the corpse to perform an autopsy before burying it in Luxemburg's grave.<ref>{{cite news|title=Berlin Authorities Seize Corpse for Pre-Burial Autopsy|publisher=SpiegelOnline|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,667606,00.html|date=17 December 2009|access-date=17 December 2009|newspaper=Spiegel Online}}</ref> The Berlin Public Prosecutor's office announced in late December 2009 that while there were indications that the corpse was Luxemburg's, there was not enough evidence to provide conclusive proof. In particular, DNA extracted from the hair of Luxemburg's niece did not match that belonging to the cadaver. Tsokos had earlier said that the chances of a match were only 40%. The remains were to be buried at an undisclosed location while testing was to continue on tissue samples.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rosa Luxemburg "floater" released for burial after 90 years|publisher=Salon.com|work=Lost in Berlin|url=http://open.salon.com/blog/lost_in_berlin/2009/12/30/rosa_luxemburg_floater_released_for_burial_after_90_years|date=30 December 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111173814/http://open.salon.com/blog/lost_in_berlin/2009/12/30/rosa_luxemburg_floater_released_for_burial_after_90_years|archive-date=11 January 2012}}</ref>
