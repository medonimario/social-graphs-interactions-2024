'''Plato''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|eɪ|t|oʊ}} {{respell|PLAY|toe}};{{sfn|Jones|2006}} [[Greek language|Greek]]: Πλάτων, ''Plátōn''), born '''Aristocles''' (Ἀριστοκλῆς; {{Circa|427}} – 348 BC), was an [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosopher]] of the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] who is considered a foundational thinker in [[Western philosophy]] and an innovator of the written [[dialogue]] and [[dialectic]] forms. He raised problems for what became all the major areas of both [[theoretical philosophy]] and [[practical philosophy]], and was the founder of the [[Platonic Academy]], a philosophical school in [[History of Athens|Athens]] where Plato taught the doctrines that would later become known as [[Platonism]]. 
 
Plato's most famous contribution is the [[theory of forms|theory of forms (or ideas)]], which has been interpreted as advancing a solution to what is now known as the [[problem of universals]]. He was decisively influenced by the pre-Socratic thinkers [[Pythagoras]], [[Heraclitus]], and [[Parmenides]], although much of what is known about them is derived from Plato himself.{{efn|"Though influenced primarily by Socrates, to the extent that Socrates is usually the main character in many of Plato's writings, he was also influenced by Heraclitus, Parmenides, and the Pythagoreans"<ref name="auto">[[#{{harvid|Brickhouse|Smith}}|Brickhouse & Smith]].</ref>}}

Along with his teacher [[Socrates]], and [[Aristotle]], his student, Plato is a central figure in the history of [[Western philosophy]].{{efn|"...the subject of philosophy, as it is often conceived{{snd}}a rigorous and systematic examination of [[ethical]], political, [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[epistemology|epistemological]] issues, armed with a distinctive method{{snd}}can be called his invention."<ref name="SEP">{{harvnb|Kraut|2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato and Aristotle: How Do They Differ?|encyclopedia=Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/story/plato-and-aristotle-how-do-they-differ |quote=Plato (c. 428–c. 348 BCE) and Aristotle (384–322 BCE) are generally regarded as the two greatest figures of Western philosophy |first1=Brian |last1=Duignan |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231217000145/https://www.britannica.com/story/plato-and-aristotle-how-do-they-differ |archive-date= Dec 17, 2023 }}</ref>}} Plato's entire body of work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years{{Emdash}}unlike that of nearly all of his contemporaries.<ref>Cooper, John M.; Hutchinson, D.S., eds.

== Names ==
{{Anchor|Name}}Plato ({{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Πλάτων|Πλάτων]]}}, {{transl|grc|Plátōn}}, from {{transl-grc|πλατύς|broad}}) is often thought to be a [[Ancient Greek personal names|nickname]]. Although it is a fact that the philosopher called himself ''Platon'' in his maturity, the origin of this name remains mysterious. ''Platon'' was a fairly common name (31 instances are known from Athens alone),{{sfn|Guthrie|1986|loc=p. 12 (footnote)}} but the name does not occur in Plato's known family line.<ref name="Sedley 21-2">[[David Sedley|Sedley, David]], ''Plato's Cratylus'', Cambridge University Press 2003, [https://assets.cambridge.org/052158/4922/sample/0521584922ws.pdf pp. 21–22] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193843/http://assets.cambridge.org/052158/4922/sample/0521584922ws.pdf|date=3 March 2016}}.</ref>

The sources of Diogenes Laertius account for this by claiming his [[Greek wrestling|wrestling]] coach, Ariston of Argos, dubbed him "broad" on account of his chest and shoulders, or that Plato derived his name from the breadth of his eloquence, or his wide forehead.<ref name="LaIV">Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', IV</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Notopoulos|1939|p=135}}</ref> [[Philodemus]], in extracts from the [[Herculaneum papyri]], corroborates the claim that Plato was named for his "broad forehead".<ref>{{Cite web |title=GreekSchools Open Access Viewer |url=https://viewer.greekschools.eu/editions/kol-02-pherc-1021 |access-date=2024-05-31 |website=viewer.greekschools.eu}}</ref>

While recalling a [[Stoicism#Ethics and virtues|moral lesson]] about frugal living, [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] mentions the meaning of Plato's name: "His very name was given him because of his broad chest."<ref>Seneca, ''Epistulae'', VI 58:29–30; translation by Robert Mott Gummere</ref> According to Diogenes Laertius,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;4}} his birth name was ''Aristocles'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀριστοκλῆς}}), meaning 'best reputation'.{{efn|From ''[[Arete|aristos]]'' and ''[[kleos]]''}}

[[Robin Waterfield]] states that Plato was not a nickname, but a perfectly normal name, and "the common practice of naming a son after his grandfather was reserved for the eldest son", not Plato.<ref name="Waterfield">Robin Waterfield: ''Plato of Athens''. Oxford University Press, 2023.</ref>

Plato may have travelled to Italy, [[Sicily]], Egypt, and [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]].{{sfn|McEvoy|1984}} At 40, he founded a school of philosophy, the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]]. It was located in Athens, on a plot of land in the Grove of Hecademus or [[Academus]],{{sfn|Cairns|1961|p=xiii}} named after an [[Attica|Attic]] hero in [[Greek mythology]].

According to [[Diogenes Laertius]], throughout his later life, Plato became entangled with the politics of the city of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], where he attempted to replace the tyrant [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]],{{sfn|Riginos|1976|p=73}} with Dionysius's brother-in-law, [[Dion of Syracuse]], whom Plato had recruited as one of his followers, but the tyrant himself turned against Plato.

Eventually Plato left Syracuse and Dion would return to overthrow Dionysius and rule Syracuse, before being usurped by [[Callippus of Syracuse|Callippus]], a fellow disciple of Plato.

A variety of sources have given accounts of Plato's death. One story, based on a mutilated manuscript,{{sfn|Riginos|1976|p=194}} suggests Plato died in his bed, whilst a young [[Thracian]] girl played the flute to him.{{sfn|Schall|1996}} Another tradition suggests Plato died at a wedding feast.

== Influences ==
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato was one of the devoted young followers of Socrates, whose bust is pictured above.]]

=== Socrates ===
{{main|Socratic problem}}
Plato never speaks in his own voice in [[Socratic dialogues|his dialogues]]; every dialogue except the ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' features Socrates, although many dialogues, including the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'', feature him speaking only rarely. [[Leo Strauss]] notes that Socrates' reputation for [[irony]] casts doubt on whether Plato's Socrates is expressing sincere beliefs.{{sfn|Strauss|1964|pp=50–51}} [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'' and [[Aristophanes]]'s ''[[The Clouds]]'' seem to present a somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints. Aristotle attributes a different doctrine with respect to Forms to Plato and Socrates.<ref>''Metaphysics'' 987b1–11</ref> Aristotle suggests that Socrates' idea of forms can be discovered through investigation of the natural world, unlike Plato's Forms that exist beyond and outside the ordinary range of human understanding.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Religion of Socrates |last=McPherran |first=M.L. |publisher=Penn State Press |year=1998 |page=268}}</ref> The Socratic problem concerns how to reconcile these various accounts. The precise relationship between Plato and Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars.{{sfn|Vlastos|1991}}{{page needed|date=April 2023}}

=== Pythagoreanism ===
{{main|Pythagoreanism}}
[[File:Kapitolinischer Pythagoras adjusted.jpg|right|upright|thumb|The mathematical and mystical teachings of the followers of Pythagoras, pictured above, exerted a strong influence on Plato.]]
Although Socrates influenced Plato directly, the influence of [[Pythagoras]], or in a broader sense, the Pythagoreans, such as [[Archytas]] also appears to have been significant. Aristotle and [[Cicero]] both claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]].<ref>Metaphysics, 1.6.1 (987a)</ref><ref>Tusc. Disput. 1.17.39.</ref> According to [[R. M. Hare]], this influence consists of three points:
# The platonic Republic might be related to the idea of "a tightly organized community of like-minded thinkers", like the one established by Pythagoras in Croton.
# The idea that mathematics and, generally speaking, abstract thinking is a secure basis for philosophical thinking as well as "for substantial theses in [[science]] and [[morals]]".
# They shared a "mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world".<ref>R.M. Hare, Plato in C.C.W. Taylor, R.M.

Pythagoras held that all things are number, and the cosmos comes from numerical principles. He introduced the concept of form as distinct from matter, and that the physical world is an imitation of an eternal mathematical world. These ideas were very influential on Heraclitus, Parmenides and Plato.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Calian |first=Florin George |url=https://brill.com/display/book/9789004467224/BP000010.xml |title=Numbers, Ontologically Speaking: Plato on Numerosity |year=2021 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-46722-4 |language=en |access-date=10 April 2023 |archive-date=7 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230507230433/https://brill.com/display/book/9789004467224/BP000010.xml |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=McFarlane>{{cite web |last1=McFarlane |first1=Thomas J. |title=Plato's Parmenides |url=http://www.integralscience.org/platoparmenides.html |website=Integralscience |access-date=12 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222045722/http://www.integralscience.org/platoparmenides.html|archive-date=22 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The two philosophers [[Heraclitus]] and [[Parmenides]], influenced by earlier [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic Greek philosophers]] such as Pythagoras and [[Xenophanes]],<ref name="Palmer">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parmenides |title=Parmenides |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |author=John Palmer |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year=2019|access-date=18 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020023553/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parmenides/|archive-date=20 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> departed from mythological explanations for the universe and began the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] tradition that strongly influenced Plato and continues today.<ref name="McFarlane" /> Heraclitus viewed all things as [[Impermanence|continuously changing]], that one cannot "step into the same river twice" due to the ever-changing waters flowing through it, and all things exist as a contraposition of opposites.

Plato's ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'' dialogue includes an [[Eleatics|Eleatic]] stranger. These ideas about change and permanence, or becoming and Being, influenced Plato in formulating his theory of Forms.<ref name="Large" />

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Platonism}}
{{Platonism}}
In Plato's dialogues, Socrates and his company of disputants had something to say on many subjects, including several aspects of [[metaphysics]]. These include religion and science, human nature, love, and sexuality. More than one dialogue contrasts perception and [[reality]], [[nature]] and custom, and body and soul. [[F. M. Cornford|Francis Cornford]] identified the "twin pillars of Platonism" as the theory of Forms, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the doctrine of immortality of the soul.<ref>Francis Cornford, 1941. ''The Republic of Plato''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. xxv.</ref>

=== The Forms ===
{{See also|Theory of forms|l1=Plato's theory of Forms}}
In the dialogues Socrates regularly asks for the meaning of a general term (e. g. justice, truth, beauty), and criticizes those who instead give him particular examples, rather than the quality shared by all examples. "Platonism" and its theory of Forms (also known as 'theory of Ideas') denies the reality of the material world, considering it only an image or copy of the real world. According to this theory of Forms, there are these two kinds of things: the apparent world of material objects grasped by the senses, which constantly changes, and an unchanging and unseen world of Forms, grasped by reason ({{lang|grc|λογική}}). Plato's Forms represent [[Type (metaphysics)|types]] of things, as well as [[property (metaphysics)|properties]], patterns, and [[Relations (philosophy)|relations]], which are referred to as objects. Just as individual tables, chairs, and cars refer to objects in this world, 'tableness', 'chairness', and 'carness', as well as e.g. [[justice]], [[truth]], and [[beauty]] refer to objects in another world. One of Plato's most cited examples for the Forms were the truths of [[geometry]], such as the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The theory of Forms is first introduced in the ''[[Phaedo]]'' dialogue (also known as ''On the Soul''), wherein Socrates disputes the [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] of [[Anaxagoras]], then the most popular response to Heraclitus and Parmenides.

=== The Soul ===
{{See also|Plato's theory of soul}}
For Plato, as was characteristic of ancient Greek philosophy, the soul was that which gave life.<ref>See this brief exchange from the ''Phaedo'': "What is it that, when present in a body, makes it living? – A soul." ''Phaedo'' 105c.</ref> Plato advocates a belief in the immortality of the soul, and several dialogues end with long speeches imagining the [[afterlife]]. In the ''Timaeus'', Socrates locates the parts of the soul within the human body: Reason is located in the head, spirit in the top third of the [[torso]], and the appetite in the middle third of the torso, down to the [[navel]].<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DTim.%3Asection%3D44d 44d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211211192903/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0180:text%3DTim.:section%3D44d |date=11 December 2021 }} & [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DTim.%3Apage%3D70 70] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211211192856/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0180:text%3DTim.:page%3D70 |date=11 December 2021 }}</ref>{{sfn|Dorter|2006|p=360}}

Furthermore, Plato evinces a belief in the theory of [[reincarnation]] in multiple dialogues (such as the ''Phaedo'' and ''Timaeus''). Scholars debate whether he intends the theory to be literally true, however.<ref>Jorgensen 2018 is perhaps the strongest opponent to interpretations on which Plato intends the theory literally. See Jorgensen, ''The Embodied Soul in Plato's Later Thought''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018.</ref> He uses this idea of reincarnation to introduce the concept that knowledge is a matter of [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|recollection]] of things acquainted with before one is born, and not of observation or study.{{sfn|Baird & Kaufmann|2008}} Keeping with the theme of admitting his own ignorance, Socrates regularly complains of his forgetfulness. In the ''Meno'', Socrates uses a geometrical example to expound Plato's view that knowledge in this latter sense is acquired by recollection. Socrates elicits a fact concerning a geometrical construction from a slave boy, who could not have otherwise known the fact (due to the slave boy's lack of education). The knowledge must be of, Socrates concludes, an eternal, non-perceptible Form.

=== Epistemology ===
{{main|Platonic epistemology}}
[[File:Classical definition of Kno.svg|thumb|A Venn diagram illustrating the classical theory of knowledge]]
Plato also discusses several aspects of [[epistemology]]. In several dialogues, Socrates inverts the common man's intuition about what is knowable and what is real. Reality is unavailable to those who use their senses. Socrates says that he who sees with his eyes is blind. While most people take the objects of their senses to be real if anything is, Socrates is contemptuous of people who think that something has to be graspable in the hands to be real. In the ''Theaetetus'', he says such people are ''eu amousoi'' (εὖ ἄμουσοι), an expression that means literally, "happily without the muses".<ref>''Theaetetus'' 156a</ref> In other words, such people are willingly ignorant, living without divine inspiration and access to higher insights about reality. Many have interpreted Plato as stating{{snd}}even having been the first to write{{snd}}that [[knowledge]] is [[justified true belief]], an influential view that informed future developments in epistemology.{{sfn|Fine|2003|p=5}} Plato also identified problems with the ''justified true belief'' definition in the ''Theaetetus'', concluding that justification (or an "account") would require knowledge of ''difference'', meaning that the [[definition of knowledge]] is [[circular reasoning|circular]].<ref>''Theaetetus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0172%3Atext%3DTheaet.%3Asection%3D210a 210a–b] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211211102748/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0172:text%3DTheaet.:section%3D210a |date=11 December 2021 }}</ref>{{sfn|McDowell|1973|p=256}}

In the ''Sophist'', ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'', ''Republic'', ''Timaeus'', and the ''Parmenides'', Plato associates knowledge with the apprehension of unchanging Forms and their relationships to one another (which he calls "expertise" in dialectic), including through the processes of ''collection'' and ''division''.{{sfn|Taylor|2011|pp=176–187}} More explicitly, Plato himself argues in the ''Timaeus'' that knowledge is always proportionate to the realm from which it is gained. In other words, if one derives one's account of something experientially, because the world of sense is in flux, the views therein attained will be mere opinions. Meanwhile, opinions are characterized by a lack of necessity and stability. On the other hand, if one derives one's account of something by way of the non-sensible Forms, because these Forms are unchanging, so too is the account derived from them. That apprehension of Forms is required for knowledge may be taken to cohere with Plato's theory in the ''Theaetetus'' and ''Meno''.{{sfn|Lee|2011|p=432}} Indeed, the apprehension of Forms may be at the base of the account required for justification, in that it offers [[Foundationalism|foundational]] knowledge which itself needs no account, thereby avoiding an [[infinite regression]].{{sfn|Taylor|2011|p=189}}

[[File:Temida, Gdansk Court.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|"What is justice?" forms one of the core quandaries of the ''Republic''.]]

=== Ethics ===
{{see also|Form of the Good}}
Several dialogues discuss [[ethics]] including virtue and vice, pleasure and pain, crime and punishment, and justice and medicine. Socrates presents the famous [[Euthyphro dilemma]] in the [[Euthyphro|dialogue]] of the same name: "Is the [[piety|pious]] ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) loved by the [[deity|gods]] because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?" ([[Stephanus pagination|10a]]) In the ''Protagoras'' dialogue it is argued through Socrates that virtue is innate and cannot be learned, that no one does bad on purpose, and to know what is good results in doing what is good; that knowledge is virtue. In the ''Republic'', Plato poses the question, "What is justice?" and by examining both individual justice and the justice that informs societies, Plato is able not only to inform metaphysics, but also ethics and politics with the question: "What is the basis of moral and social obligation?" Plato's well-known answer rests upon the fundamental responsibility to seek wisdom, wisdom which leads to an understanding of the Form of the Good. Plato views "The Good" as the supreme Form, somehow existing even "beyond being". In this manner, justice is obtained when knowledge of how to fulfill one's moral and political function in society is put into practice.<ref>[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]], Book IV.</ref>

=== Politics ===
{{main|Plato's political philosophy}}
[[File:POxy3679 Parts Plato Republic.jpg|thumb|[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]], with fragment of Plato's ''Republic'']]
The dialogues also discuss politics. Some of Plato's most famous doctrines are contained in the ''Republic'' as well as in the ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' and the ''Statesman''. Because these opinions are not spoken directly by Plato and vary between dialogues, they cannot be straightforwardly assumed as representing Plato's own views.

Socrates asserts that societies have a tripartite class structure corresponding to the appetite/spirit/reason structure of the individual soul. The appetite/spirit/reason are analogous to the castes of society.{{sfn|Blössner|2007|pp=345–349}}
* ''Productive'' (Workers)&nbsp;– the labourers, carpenters, plumbers, masons, merchants, farmers, ranchers, etc. These correspond to the "appetite" part of the soul.
* ''Protective'' (Warriors or Guardians)&nbsp;– those who are adventurous, strong and brave; in the armed forces. These correspond to the "spirit" part of the soul.
* ''Governing'' (Rulers or Philosopher Kings)&nbsp;– those who are intelligent, rational, self-controlled, in love with wisdom, well suited to make decisions for the community. These correspond to the "reason" part of the soul and are very few.

According to Socrates, a state made up of different kinds of souls will, overall, decline from an aristocracy (rule by the best) to a [[timocracy]] (rule by the honourable), then to an oligarchy (rule by the few), then to a [[democracy]] (rule by the people), and finally to [[tyranny]] (rule by one person, rule by a tyrant).{{sfn|Blössner|2007|p=350}}

=== Rhetoric and poetry ===
{{Rhetoric}}
Several dialogues tackle questions about art, including rhetoric and rhapsody. Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of [[divine madness]] (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''Phaedrus'',<ref>''Phaedrus ''(265a–c)</ref> and yet in the ''Republic'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetry, and laughter as well. Scholars often view Plato's philosophy as at odds with rhetoric due to his criticisms of rhetoric in the ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' and his ambivalence toward rhetoric expressed in the ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]''. But other contemporary researchers contest the idea that Plato despised rhetoric and instead view his dialogues as a dramatization of complex rhetorical principles.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kastely|first=James|url=https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo20698062.html|title=The Rhetoric of Plato's Republic|publisher=Chicago UP|year=2015|language=en|access-date=28 September 2021|archive-date=28 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210928102316/https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo20698062.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bjork|first=Collin|date=2021|title=Plato, Xenophon, and the Uneven Temporalities of Ethos in the Trial of Socrates|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/philrhet.54.3.0240|journal=Philosophy & Rhetoric|volume=54|issue=3|pages=240–262|doi=10.5325/philrhet.54.3.0240|jstor=10.5325/philrhet.54.3.0240|s2cid=244334227|issn=0031-8213|access-date=28 September 2021|archive-date=21 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211221094405/https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/philrhet.54.3.0240|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Bengtson|first=Erik|title=The epistemology of rhetoric: Plato, doxa and post-truth|publisher=Uppsala|year=2019}}</ref> Plato made abundant use of mythological narratives in his own work;<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chappel |first1=Timothy |title=Mythos and Logos in Plato |url=https://www.academia.edu/10450689 |publisher=Open University |access-date=20 August 2017 |archive-date=4 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220704152151/https://www.academia.edu/10450689 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is generally agreed that the main purpose for Plato in using myths was didactic.<ref>Jorgensen, Chad.

=== Definition of humanity ===
When considering the [[Names for the human species|taxonomic definition of mankind]], Plato proposed the term "featherless biped",<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Plato]]|chapter=[[Statesman (dialogue)|The Statesman]]|url=https://archive.org/details/b2900049x_0008/page/41/mode/1up|translator=[[Harold North Fowler|Harold N[orth] Fowler]]|title=Plato in Twelve Volumes with an English Translation|location=Cambridge, Mass.|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]; London: [[Heinemann (publisher)|William Heinemann]]|orig-date=1925|year=1975|volume=VIII (The Statesman, Philebus, Ion)|pages=40–41|isbn=978-0-674-99182-8|quote=λέγω δὴ δεῖν τότε εὐθὺς τὸ πεζὸν τῷ δίποδι πρὸς τὸ τετράπουν γένος διανεῖμαι, κατιδόντα δὲ τἀνθρώπινον ἔτι μόνῳ τῷ πτηνῷ συνειληχὸς τὴν δίποδα ἀγέλην πάλιν τῷ ψιλῷ καὶ τῷ πτεροφυεῖ τέμνειν, [...]|trans-quote=I say, then, that we ought at that time to have divided walking animals immediately into biped and quadruped, then seeing that the human race falls into the same division with the feathered creatures and no others, we must again divide the biped class into featherless and feathered, [...]}}</ref> and later {{lang|grc|ζῷον πολιτικόν}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|zōon politikon}}), a "political" or "state-building" animal ([[Aristotle]]'s term, based on Plato's ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'').

[[Diogenes the Cynic]] took issue with the former definition, reportedly producing a recently plucked chicken with the exclamation of "Here is Plato’s man!"<ref>[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''Lives of Philosophers'' 6.40.

{{See also|List of speakers in Plato's dialogues}}
Plato never presents himself as a participant in any of the dialogues, and with the exception of the ''Apology'', there is no suggestion that he heard any of the dialogues firsthand. Some dialogues have no narrator but have a pure "dramatic" form, some dialogues are narrated by Socrates himself, who speaks in the first person. The ''Symposium'' is narrated by Apollodorus, a Socratic disciple, apparently to Glaucon. Apollodorus assures his listener that he is recounting the story, which took place when he himself was an infant, not from his own memory, but as remembered by Aristodemus, who told him the story years ago. The ''Theaetetus'' is also a peculiar case: a dialogue in dramatic form embedded within another dialogue in dramatic form. Some scholars take this as an indication that Plato had by this date wearied of the narrated form.{{sfn|Burnet|1928a|loc=§&nbsp;177}} In most of the dialogues, the primary speaker is Socrates, who employs a [[Socratic method|method]] of questioning which proceeds by a dialogue form called dialectic. The role of dialectic in Plato's thought is contested but there are two main interpretations: a type of reasoning and a method of intuition.{{sfn|Blackburn|1996|p=104}} [[Simon Blackburn]] adopts the first, saying that Plato's dialectic is "the process of eliciting the truth by means of questions aimed at opening out what is already implicitly known, or at exposing the contradictions and muddles of an opponent's position."{{sfn|Blackburn|1996|p=104}} [[Karl Popper]], on the other hand, claims that dialectic is the art of intuition for "visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery behind the common man's everyday world of appearances".{{sfn|Popper|1962|p=133}}

=== Authenticity ===
{{further|Pseudo-Platonica}}
Thirty-five dialogues and thirteen letters (the [[Epistles (Plato)|''Epistles'']]) have traditionally been ascribed to Plato, though modern scholarship doubts the authenticity of at least some of these. Jowett<ref>[[Benjamin Jowett|B Jowett]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1682/1682-h/1682-h.htm ''Menexenus'': Appendix I (1st paragraph)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924202144/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1682/1682-h/1682-h.htm |date=24 September 2015 }}.</ref> mentions in his Appendix to Menexenus, that works which bore the character of a writer were attributed to that writer even when the actual author was unknown.
The works taken as genuine in antiquity but are now doubted by at least some modern scholars are: ''[[First Alcibiades|Alcibiades I]]'' (*),{{efn|(*) if there is no consensus among scholars as to whether Plato is the author, and (‡) if most scholars agree that Plato is ''not'' the author of the work. The extent to which scholars consider a dialogue to be authentic is noted in {{harvnb|Cooper|1997|pp=v–vi}}.}} ''[[Second Alcibiades|Alcibiades II]]'' (‡), ''[[Clitophon (dialogue)|Clitophon]]'' (*), ''[[Epinomis]]'' (‡), ''[[Epistles (Plato)|Letters]]'' (*), ''[[Hipparchus (dialogue)|Hipparchus]]'' (‡), ''[[Menexenus (dialogue)|Menexenus]]'' (*), ''[[Minos (dialogue)|Minos]]'' (‡), ''[[Rival Lovers|Lovers]]'' (‡), ''[[Theages]]'' (‡)
The following works were transmitted under Plato's name in antiquity, but were already considered spurious by the 1st century AD: ''[[Axiochus (dialogue)|Axiochus]]'', ''[[Definitions (Plato)|Definitions]]'', ''[[Demodocus (dialogue)|Demodocus]]'', ''[[Epigrams (Plato)|Epigrams]]'', ''[[Eryxias (dialogue)|Eryxias]]'', ''[[Halcyon (dialogue)|Halcyon]]'', ''[[On Justice]]'', ''[[On Virtue]]'', ''[[Sisyphus (dialogue)|Sisyphus]]''.

=== Chronology ===
No one knows the exact order Plato's dialogues were written in, nor the extent to which some might have been later revised and rewritten. The works are usually grouped into ''Early'' (sometimes by some into ''Transitional''), ''Middle'', and ''Late'' period; The following represents one relatively common division amongst developmentalist scholars.<ref>See {{harvnb|Guthrie|1986}}; {{harvnb|Vlastos|1991}}; {{harvnb|Penner|1992}}; {{harvnb|Kahn|1996}}; {{harvnb|Fine|1999b}}.</ref>
* Early: ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', ''[[Euthyphro]]'', ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', ''[[Hippias Minor]]'', ''[[Hippias Major]]'', ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', ''[[Laches (dialogue)|Laches]]'', ''[[Lysis (dialogue)|Lysis]]'', ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]''
* Middle: ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', ''[[Euthydemus (dialogue)|Euthydemus]]'', ''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theatetus]]''
* Late: ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]'', ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'', ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', ''[[Philebus]]'', ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]].{{sfn|Dodds|2004}}''

Whereas those classified as "early dialogues" often conclude in [[aporia]], the so-called "middle dialogues" provide more clearly stated positive teachings that are often ascribed to Plato such as the theory of Forms. The remaining dialogues are classified as "late" and are generally agreed to be difficult and challenging pieces of philosophy.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=xiv}} It should, however, be kept in mind that many of the positions in the ordering are still highly disputed, and also that the very notion that Plato's dialogues can or should be "ordered" is by no means universally accepted,{{sfn|Cooper|1997}}{{efn|Increasingly in the most recent Plato scholarship, writers are skeptical of the notion that the order of Plato's writings can be established with any precision.<ref>{{harvnb|Kraut|2013}}; {{harvnb|Schofield|2002}}; and {{harvnb|Rowe|2006}}.</ref>}} though Plato's works are still often characterized as falling at least roughly into three groups stylistically.<ref name="auto" />

=== Unwritten doctrines ===
{{Main|Plato's unwritten doctrines|Allegorical interpretations of Plato}}
[[Plato's unwritten doctrines]] are,{{sfn|Rodriguez-Grandjean|1998}}<ref>{{harvnb|Reale|1990}}. Cf. p. 14 and onwards.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Krämer|1990}}. Cf. pp. 38–47.</ref> according to some ancient sources, the most fundamental metaphysical teaching of Plato, which he disclosed only orally, and some say only to his most trusted fellows, and which he may have kept secret from the public, although many modern scholars{{who|date=January 2023}} doubt these claims. A reason for not revealing it to everyone is partially discussed in ''Phaedrus'' where Plato criticizes the written transmission of knowledge as faulty, favouring instead the spoken ''[[logos]]'': "he who has knowledge of the just and the good and beautiful ... will not, when in earnest, write them in ink, sowing them through a pen with words, which cannot defend themselves by argument and cannot teach the truth effectually."<ref>''Phaedrus'' 276c</ref> It is, however, said that Plato once disclosed this knowledge to the public in his lecture ''On the Good'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ τἀγαθοῦ}}), in which the Good ({{lang|grc|τὸ ἀγαθόν}}) is identified with the One (the Unity, {{lang|grc|τὸ ἕν}}), the fundamental ontological principle.

The first witness who mentions its existence is Aristotle, who in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' writes: "It is true, indeed, that the account he gives there [i.e. in ''Timaeus''] of the participant is different from what he says in his so-called ''unwritten teachings'' ({{transl-grc|ἄγραφα δόγματα}})."<ref>''Physics'' 209b</ref> In ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' he writes: "Now since the Forms are the causes of everything else, he [i.e. Plato] supposed that their elements are the elements of all things. Accordingly, the material principle is the Great and Small [i.e. the Dyad], and the essence is the One ({{lang|grc|τὸ ἕν}}), since the numbers are derived from the Great and Small by participation in the One".<ref name="auto1">''Metaphysics'' 987b</ref> "From this account it is clear that he only employed two causes: that of the essence, and the material cause; for the Forms are the cause of the essence in everything else, and the One is the cause of it in the Forms. He also tells us what the material substrate is of which the Forms are predicated in the case of sensible things, and the One in that of the Forms{{snd}}that it is this the duality (the Dyad, {{lang|grc|ἡ δυάς}}), the Great and Small ({{lang|grc|τὸ μέγα καὶ τὸ μικρόν}}). Further, he assigned to these two elements respectively the causation of good and of evil".<ref name="auto1" />

The most important aspect of this interpretation of Plato's metaphysics is the continuity between his teaching and the Neoplatonic interpretation of [[Plotinus]]{{efn|[[Plotinus]] describes this in the last part of his final ''[[Enneads|Ennead]]'' (VI, 9) entitled ''On the Good, or the One'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ τἀγαθοῦ ἢ τοῦ ἑνός}}). Jens Halfwassen states in [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2006/2006-08-16.html ''Der Aufstieg zum Einen'] (2006) that "Plotinus' ontology{{snd}}which should be called Plotinus' [[henology]]{{snd}}is a rather accurate philosophical renewal and continuation of Plato's unwritten doctrine, i.e. the doctrine rediscovered by Krämer and Gaiser."}} or [[Ficino]]{{efn|In one of his letters (Epistolae 1612) [[Ficino]] writes: "The main goal of the divine Plato ... is to show one principle of things, which he called the One ({{lang|grc|τὸ ἕν}})", cf. {{harvnb|Montoriola|1926|p=147}}.}} which has been considered erroneous by many but may in fact have been directly influenced by oral transmission of Plato's doctrine. A modern scholar who recognized the importance of the unwritten doctrine of Plato was [[Heinrich Gomperz]] who described it in his speech during the 7th [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in 1930.{{sfn|Gomperz|1931}} All the sources related to the {{lang|grc|ἄγραφα δόγματα}} have been collected by Konrad Gaiser and published as ''Testimonia Platonica''.{{sfn|Gaiser|1998}}

=== Reception ===
{{see also|Transmission of the Greek Classics}}
Plato's thought is often compared with that of his most famous student, [[Aristotle]], whose reputation during the Western [[Middle Ages]] so completely eclipsed that of Plato that the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers referred to Aristotle as "the Philosopher". The only Platonic work known to western scholarship was ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', until translations were made after the fall of [[Constantinople]], which occurred during 1453.<ref>C.U.

Many of these commentaries on Plato were translated from Arabic into Latin and as such influenced Medieval scholastic philosophers.<ref>See {{harvnb|Burrell|1998}} and {{harvnb|Hasse|2002|pp=33–45}}.</ref>

During the [[Renaissance]], [[George Gemistos Plethon]] brought Plato's original writings to Florence from Constantinople in the century of its fall. Many of the greatest early modern scientists and artists who broke with [[Scholasticism]], with the support of the Plato-inspired [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]] (grandson of Cosimo), saw Plato's philosophy as the basis for progress in the arts and sciences. The 17th century [[Cambridge Platonists]], sought to reconcile Plato's more problematic beliefs, such as [[metempsychosis]] and polyamory, with Christianity.<ref name="Carrigan 2012">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Carrigan |first=Henry L. Jr. |title=Cambridge Platonists |year=2012 |origyear=2011 |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Christian Civilization |location=[[Chichester, West Sussex]] |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |doi=10.1002/9780470670606.wbecc0219 |isbn=978-1405157629}}</ref> By the 19th century, Plato's reputation was restored, and at least on par with Aristotle's. Plato's influence has been especially strong in mathematics and the sciences. Plato's resurgence further inspired some of the greatest advances in logic since Aristotle, primarily through [[Gottlob Frege]]. [[Albert Einstein]] suggested that the scientist who takes philosophy seriously would have to avoid systematization and take on many different roles, and possibly appear as a Platonist or Pythagorean, in that such a one would have "the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research."{{sfn|Einstein|1949|pp=683–684}} British philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead|Alfred N.

==== Criticism ====
Many recent philosophers have also diverged from what some would describe as ideals characteristic of traditional Platonism. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] notoriously attacked Plato's "idea of the good itself" along with many fundamentals of Christian morality, which he interpreted as "Platonism for the masses" in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' (1886). [[Martin Heidegger]] argued against Plato's alleged obfuscation of ''[[Being]]'' in his incomplete tome, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927). [[Karl Popper]] argued in the first volume of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) that Plato's proposal for a "[[utopia]]n" political regime in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' was prototypically [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]; this has been disputed.<ref>Gerasimos Santas (2010). “Understanding Plato’s Republic”. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 198. “The modern view that Plato's completely good city is some form of totalitarian society stems from... his criticisms of democracy and his censorship of the arts. This modern view is much contradicted by Plato's placing tyranny as the polar opposite of his completely good and just city. One has to understand this polar opposition before modern criticism can stick. Plato would have a hard time understanding Popper's criticisms; yes, Plato thought of his just society as anti-democratic, but the direct democracy Plato criticized is far removed from our representative democracies and does not exist anywhere among modern nation states, just as his ideal city does not. The moderns tend to think that if a regime is not democratic then it is totalitarian. Plato's completely good city is the rule of knowledge, not the rule of power, or honor, or wealth, or freedom and equality.”</ref><ref>Levinson, Ronald B. (1970). ''In Defense of Plato''. New York: Russell and Russell. p. 20. "In spite of the high rating one must accord his initial intention of fairness, his hatred for the enemies of the 'open society,' his zeal to destroy whatever seems to him destructive of the welfare of mankind, has led him into the extensive use of what may be called terminological counterpropaganda. ... With a few exceptions in Popper's favor, however, it is noticeable that reviewers possessed of special competence in particular fields—and here Lindsay is again to be included—have objected to Popper's conclusions in those very fields. ... "Social scientists and social philosophers have deplored his radical denial of historical causation, together with his espousal of Hayek's systematic distrust of larger programs of social reform; historical students of philosophy have protested his violent polemical handling of Plato, Aristotle, and particularly Hegel; ethicists have found contradictions in the ethical theory ('critical dualism') upon which his polemic is largely based."</ref> [[Edmund Gettier]] famously demonstrated the [[Gettier problem]] for the justified true belief account of knowledge. That the modern theory of justified true belief as knowledge, which Gettier addresses, is equivalent to Plato's is, however, accepted only by some scholars but rejected by others.{{sfn|Fine|1979|p=366}}
