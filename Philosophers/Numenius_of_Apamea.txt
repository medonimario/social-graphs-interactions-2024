{{Short description|2nd century Greco-Roman philosopher}}
'''Numenius of Apamea''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Νουμήνιος ὁ ἐξ Ἀπαμείας}}, ''Noumēnios ho ex Apameias''; {{langx|la|Numenius Apamensis}}) was a Greek philosopher, who lived in [[Rome]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/numenius|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Numenius|year=2016}}</ref> and flourished during the latter half of the 2nd century AD.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Numenius |volume=19 |page=866 |inline=1}}</ref> He was a [[Neopythagorean]] and forerunner of the [[Neoplatonist]]s.

== Philosophy ==
Statements and fragments of his apparently very numerous works have been preserved by [[Origen]], [[Theodoret]], and especially by [[Eusebius]], and from them we may learn the nature of his Platonist-Pythagorean philosophy, and its approximation to the doctrines of [[Plato]].

Numenius was a [[Neopythagorean]], but his object was to trace the doctrines of Plato up to [[Pythagoras]], and at the same time to show that they were not at variance with the dogmas and mysteries of the [[Brahmins]], [[Jews]], [[Magi]] and [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptians]].<ref>See the Fragments of the 1st book ''Peri Tagathou'', in Eusebius, ''[[Praep. Evang.]]'', ix. 7.</ref> His intention was to restore the philosophy of [[Plato]], the genuine Pythagorean and mediator between [[Socrates]] and [[Pythagoras]] in its original purity, cleared from the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrines, and purified from the unsatisfactory and perverse explanations, which he said were found even in [[Speusippus]] and [[Xenocrates]], and which, through the influence of [[Arcesilaus]] and [[Carneades]] had led to a bottomless [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]].<ref>See especially Eusebius, ''Praep. Ev.'' xiv. 5.</ref> His work on the [[apostasy]] of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] from Plato, to judge from its rather numerous fragments,<ref>Euseb. ''Praep. Ev.'' xiv. 5-9</ref> contained a minute and wearisome account of the outward circumstances of those men, and was full of fabulous tales about their lives, without entering into the nature of their skepticism.

George Karamanolis from the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' noted, "The remains of Numenius' work leave no doubt that he relied primarily on texts of Plato in constructing his own system of principles. Ancient testimonies are, however, divided between those that classify him as a Platonist philosopher ([[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], Life of Plot. 14.12, [[Eusebius]], Prep. Ev. XI.21.7) and those that consider him a Pythagorean ([[Origen]], Against Celsus I.15, VI.51, V.38 frs. 1b–1c, 53, Porphyry, Ad Gaurum 34.20–35.2; fr. 36, [[Calcidius]], In Timaeum 297.8 Waszink; fr. 52.2). We should not see any contradiction or even tension in this double classification. Numenius is a Pythagorean Platonist like [[Moderatus of Gades|Moderatus]] half a century earlier or [[Eudorus of Alexandria]] around the turn of the millennium. That is, Numenius accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the two authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded Plato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he considered to be the source of all true philosophy—including Plato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many philosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed on only orally (cf. fr. 24.57-60)."<ref name="Karamanolis">{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/numenius|title=Numenius|author=George Karamanolis|year=2013|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>

His books ''On the Good'' (''Peri Tagathou'' – Περὶ Τἀγαθοῦ) seem to have been of a better kind; in them he had minutely explained, mainly in opposition to the [[Stoics]], that existence could neither be found in the [[Classical elements|elements]] because they were in a perpetual state of change and transition, nor in [[matter]] because it is vague, inconstant, lifeless, and in itself not an object of our knowledge; and that, on the contrary, existence, in order to resist the annihilation and decay of matter, must itself rather be incorporeal and removed from all mutability,<ref>Eusebius, ''Praep. Ev.'', xv. 17</ref> in eternal presence, without being subject to the variation of [[time]], simple and imperturbable in its nature by its own will as well as by influence from without.<ref>Eusebius, ''Praep. Ev.'', xi. 10.</ref> True [[existence]] is identical with the first [[god]] existing in and by itself, that is, with [[agathon|good]], and is defined as spirit (''[[nous]]'').<ref>Eusebius, ''Praep. Ev.'', xi. 18, ix. 22</ref> But as the first (absolute) god existing in itself and being undisturbed in its motion, could not be creative (''demiurgikos'' – δημιουργικός), he thought that we must assume a second god, who keeps matter together, directs its energy to it and to intelligible essences, and imparts its spirit to all creatures; its mind is directed to the first god, in whom it beholds the ideas according to which it arranges the world harmoniously, being seized with a desire to create the world. The first god communicates its ideas to the second, without losing them itself, just as we communicate knowledge to one another, without depriving ourselves of it.<ref>Eusebius, ''Praep. Ev.'', xi. 18.</ref> In regard to the relation existing between the third and second god, and to the manner in which they also are to be conceived as one (probably in opposition to the vague duration of matter), no information can be derived from the fragments which have come down to us.

== Numenius and Judaism and Christianity ==
Numenius is quoted by multiple ancient writers as having referred to Plato as the "Atticizing [[Moses]],"<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromata'', i. 22; Eusebius, ''Praep. Evang.'', xi. 10; Suda, ''Numenius''</ref> i.e., the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] Moses.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bar-Kochva |first=Bezalel |author-link=Bezalel Bar-Kochva |date=2010 |title=The Image of the Jews in Greek Literature: The Hellenistic Period |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520943636}}</ref><ref>see Treatise of the Good First book, Practical Questions 13 Plato as a Greek Moses</ref> "But what is Plato", Numenius said, "but Moses speaking in Attic Greek?"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ciholas|first1=Paul|title=Plato: The Attic Moses?

This attention however is not motivated by historical concerns on the part of Numenius but rather by philosophical ones. Numenius wanted to show that the Jewish nation must be counted among the ancient ones that have a share in logos and also that Moses had a conception of the first principle similar to that of Plato, since both identified God with being."<ref name="Karamanolis" />

His chief divergence from Plato is the distinction between the "first god" and the "[[demiurge]]." This is probably due to the influence of Jewish-Alexandrian philosophers (especially [[Philo]] and his theory of the [[Logos]]). According to [[Proclus]],<ref>Proclus, ''Comment. in Timaeum'', 93</ref> his works were highly esteemed by the Neoplatonists, and Plotinus' student [[Amelius]] (who was critical of [[Gnosticism]], see [[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]])<ref>Professor [[John D Turner]] considers [[Plotinus]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], and [[Amelius]] all to be Neoplatonic philosophers who were critical of Gnosticism.

At this time, whatever Sethianism was left became increasingly fragmented into various derivative and other [[sectarian]] gnostic groups such as the [[Archontics]], [[Audians]], [[Borborites]], [[Phibionites]] and others, some of which survived into the Middle Ages."</ref> is said to have composed nearly two books of commentaries upon them.<ref name=EB1911/> Contrary to orthodox Christian teaching (and more in line with the teachings of Gnosticism), like [[Orpheus]]{{please clarify|date=November 2023}} and [[Plato]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/cratylus.html|title = The Internet Classics Archive &#124; Cratylus by Plato}}</ref> Numenius wrote of the human body as a prison of the soul.<ref>Book three "The Initiate" (or "The Hoopoe", the bird of prognostication) p. 43: "The soul is retained in the body as in a Prison, by the impulsive passion."

== Works ==
Fragments of his treatises on the points of divergence between the Academicians and Plato, ''On the Good'' (in which according to [[Origen]], ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', iv. 51, he makes allusion to [[Jesus Christ]]), and on the mystical sayings in Plato, are preserved in the ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]'' of [[Eusebius]]. The fragments are collected in F. W. A. Mullach, ''[[Fragmenta Philosophorum Graecorum]]'' iii.; see also [[F. Thedinga]], ''De Numenio philosopho Platonico'' (Bonn, 1875); [[Heinrich Ritter]] and [[Ludwig Preller]], ''Hist. Phil. Graecae'' (ed. [[E. Wellmann]], 1898), 624–7; [[T.
