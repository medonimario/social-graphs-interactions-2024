'''William of Auxerre'''<ref>Guillaume d'Auxerre, Guillelmus Autissiodorensis, Wilhelm von Auxerre.</ref> (1140/50–1231) was a French [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[theologian]] and official in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

The teacher by whom William was most influenced was [[Praepositinus]], or Prevostin, of Cremona, Chancellor of the University of Paris from 1206 to 1209. The names of teacher and pupil are mentioned in the same sentence by [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref>''Haec est opinio Praepositini et Autissiodorensis'' (in I Sent., XV, q. 11).</ref>

He was an Archdeacon of [[Beauvais]] before becoming a professor of theology at the university in [[Paris]].  In 1231, he was made a member of the commission appointed by [[Gregory IX]] to examine [[Aristotle]]'s writings on the natural sciences and to offer amendments where religiously necessary.  Consequently, William was one of the first theologians to be influenced by Aristotle.  His ''Summa Aurea'' shows a debt still to [[Peter Lombard]], and it advances the [[ontological argument]], but it also shows novelty and an intellectual awareness and insistence on the physical that had not been seen earlier.  ''Summa Aurea'' influenced [[John of Treviso]].
