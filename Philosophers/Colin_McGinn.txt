'''Colin McGinn''' (born 10 March 1950) is a British philosopher. He has held teaching posts and professorships at [[University College London]], the [[University of Oxford]], [[Rutgers University]], and the [[University of Miami]].<ref name=cv/>

McGinn is best known for his work in [[philosophy of mind]], and in particular for what is known as [[new mysterianism]], the idea that the [[human mind]] is not equipped to solve the [[Mind-body problem|problem of consciousness]]. He has written over 20 books on this and other areas of philosophy, including ''The Character of Mind'' (1982), ''The Problem of Consciousness'' (1991), ''Consciousness and Its Objects'' (2004), and ''The Meaning of Disgust'' (2011).<ref name=cv/>

In 2013, McGinn resigned from his [[tenured position]] at the University of Miami after a graduate student accused him of [[sexual harassment]]. His resignation touched off a debate about the prevalence of [[sexism]] and sexual harassment within academic philosophy.<ref name="nyt-star">{{cite news | work = The New York Times | title = A Star Philosopher Falls, and a Debate Over Sexism Is Set Off | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/arts/colin-mcginn-philosopher-to-leave-his-post.html | first = Jennifer | last = Schuessler | date = August 2, 2013}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
McGinn was born in [[West Hartlepool]], a town in County Durham, England. Several of his relatives, including both grandfathers, were miners. His father, Joseph, left school to become a miner but put himself through night school and became a building manager instead. McGinn was the eldest of three children, all boys. When he was three, the family moved to [[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]], Kent, and eight years later to [[Blackpool]], [[Lancashire]]. Having failed his [[Eleven plus exam|11-plus]], he attended a [[Secondary Technical School|technical school]] in Kent, then a [[Secondary modern school|secondary modern]] in Blackpool, but did well enough in his [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-levels]] to transfer to the local [[grammar school]] for his [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]].<ref>Colin McGinn, ''The Making of a Philosopher'', New York: Harper Perennial, 2003, pp.&nbsp;1–4.</ref>

In 1968, McGinn began a degree in [[psychology]] at the [[University of Manchester]], obtaining a first-class honours degree in 1971 and an MA in 1972, also in psychology.<ref name=cv/> In 1972, he was admitted to [[Jesus College, Oxford]], initially to study for a [[Bachelor of Letters]] postgraduate degree. He switched to the [[Bachelor of Philosophy]] (BPhil) postgraduate programme on the recommendation of his advisor, [[Michael R. Ayers]]. In 1973, McGinn received the university's John Locke Prize in Mental Philosophy; one of the examiners was [[A.J. Ayer]].<ref>McGinn 2003, pp.&nbsp;64, 85.<br>

F. Strawson]] on the semantics of [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].<ref>McGinn 2003, pp.&nbsp;76–77.</ref>

==Teaching career==
===Posts===
McGinn taught at University College London for 11 years, first as a lecturer in philosophy (1974–84), then as [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] (1984–85). In 1985, he succeeded [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] as [[Wilde Professor of Mental Philosophy|Wilde Reader in Mental Philosophy]] at the University of Oxford, a position he held until 1990. He held visiting professorships at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (1979), [[University of Bielefeld]] (1982), [[University of Southern California]] (1983), [[Rutgers University]] (1984), [[University of Helsinki]] (1986), [[City University of New York]] (1988) and [[Princeton University]] (1992). In 1990, he joined the philosophy department at Rutgers as a full professor, working alongside [[Jerry Fodor]].<ref name=cv/>

In 2006, he joined the [[University of Miami]] as Professor of Philosophy and Cooper Fellow.<ref name=cv>{{Cite web |url=http://www.as.miami.edu/phi/v1/mcginn/CV%20McGinn.pdf |title="''Curriculum vitae''" |access-date=9 April 2012 |archive-date=22 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222173231/http://www.as.miami.edu/phi/v1/mcginn/CV%20McGinn.pdf |url-status=dead }}() and [https://web.archive.org/web/20120529063229/http://www.as.miami.edu/phi/people/faculty.html "Faculty"], Department of Philosophy, University of Miami, archived 29 May 2012.</ref>

===Sexual harassment complaint===
McGinn resigned his position at the University of Miami in January 2013, effective at the end of the calendar year, after a graduate student complained that he had been sexually harassing her, including by text and email. These documents have since been released and include explicit references to McGinn's desire to have sex with the student.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themiamihurricane.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Morrison-Complaint-2.pdf|title=Complaint and demand for jury trial against Colin McGinn and the University of Miami}}</ref> He denied any wrongdoing.<ref name=Swanson28April2015>Jess Swanson, [http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/is-it-ok-for-a-um-professor-to-burden-a-student-with-sexual-advances-7581424 "Is It OK for a UM Professor to Burden a Student With Sexual Advances?"], ''Miami New Times'', 28 April 2015.</ref>

In 2014, [[East Carolina University]] offered McGinn a visiting professorship but university administrators later rescinded the offer. McGinn blamed the sexual-harassment allegations for East Carolina's decision.<ref name="chronicle-ecu">{{Cite news | work = The Chronicle of Higher Education | title = East Carolina U.

In 2024, McGinn wrote: "I have existed in a state of professional cancellation for over ten years now. Before that I had normal access to teaching positions, publishers, conferences, professional contacts, and so on. Not anymore."<ref>[https://www.colinmcginn.net/on-cancelling/ McGinn, Colin, "On Cancelling"]</ref>

==Writing==
===Philosophy of mind===
McGinn has written extensively on [[philosophical logic]], [[metaphysics]], and [[philosophy of language]], but is best known for his work in [[philosophy of mind]]. He is known in particular for the development of the idea that human minds are incapable of solving the [[Mind-body problem|problem of consciousness]], a position known as [[new mysterianism]]. In addition to his academic publications on [[consciousness]], including ''The Character of Mind'' (1982), ''The Problem of Consciousness'' (1991) and ''Consciousness and Its Objects'' (2004), he has written a popular introduction, ''The Mysterious Flame: Conscious Minds in a Material World'' (1999).<ref>[[Galen Strawson]], [https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/11/reviews/990711.11strawst.html "Little Gray Cells"], ''The New York Times'', 11 July 1999.</ref>

[[Owen Flanagan]] introduced the term "new mysterians" in 1991 (named after the band [[Question Mark & the Mysterians]]) to describe McGinn's position and that of [[Thomas Nagel]], first described in Nagel's "[[What Is It Like to Be a Bat?]]" (1974).<ref name=Flanagan1991p313>[[Owen Flanagan]], ''The Science of the Mind'', MIT Press, 1991, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=80HIwMz3bvwC&pg=PA313 313].<br>
Thomas Nagel, "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?", ''The Philosophical Review'', 83 (4), October 1974, pp.&nbsp;435–450. {{JSTOR|2183914}} Reprinted in Thomas Nagel, ''Mortal Questions'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979, pp.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fBGPBRX3JsQC&pg=PA165 165–180].</ref> McGinn introduced his position in "Can We Solve the Mind-Body Problem?" (''Mind'', 1989), and in ''The Problem of Consciousness'' (1991), arguing that the human mind is incapable of comprehending itself entirely.<ref name=McGinn1989/> [[Mark Rowlands]] writes that the 1989 article was largely responsible for reviving the debate about [[phenomenal consciousness]], or the nature of experience.<ref>[[Mark Rowlands]], "Mysterianism," in [[Max Velmans]], Susan Schneider (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007 (pp.&nbsp;335–345), p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B1lRZmOzuJ0C&pg=PA337 337].</ref> McGinn argued in the paper for the idea of [[Cognitive closure (philosophy)|cognitive closure]]:

{{blockquote|A type of mind M is cognitively closed with respect to a property P (or theory T), if and only if the concept-forming procedures at M's disposal cannot extend to a grasp of P (or an understanding of T). Conceiving minds come in different kinds, equipped with varying powers and limitations, biases and blindspots, so that properties (or theories) may be accessible to some minds but not to others. What is closed to the mind of a rat may be open to the mind of a monkey, and what is open to us may be closed to the monkey.&nbsp;... But such closure does not reflect adversely on the reality of the properties that lie outside the representational capacities in question; a property is no less real for not being reachable from a certain kind of perceiving and conceiving mind.<ref name=McGinn1989>Colin McGinn, "Can We Solve the Mind-Body Problem?", ''Mind'', New Series, 98(391), July 1989 (pp.&nbsp;349–366), p.&nbsp;350. {{JSTOR|2254848}} Reprinted in Timothy O'Connor, David Robb (eds.), ''Philosophy of Mind: Contemporary Readings'', Routledge, 2003, pp.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EfuBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA438 438–457].</ref>}}

Although human beings might grasp the concept of consciousness, McGinn argues that we cannot understand its causal basis: neither direct examination of consciousness nor of the brain can identify the properties that cause or provide the mechanism for consciousness, or how "technicolour phenomenology [can] arise from soggy grey matter."<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2254848 McGinn 1989], p.&nbsp;349.</ref> Thus, his answer to the [[hard problem of consciousness]] is that the answer is inaccessible to us.<ref>Rowlands 2007, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B1lRZmOzuJ0C&pg=PA335 335].</ref>

New, or [[epistemological]], mysterianism is contrasted with the old, or [[ontological]], form, namely that consciousness is inherently mysterious or supernatural. The new mysterians are not [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualists]].<ref name=Flanagan1991p313/> The argument holds that human minds cannot understand consciousness, not that there is anything [[supernatural]] about it.<ref>Uriah Kriegel, "Mysterianism," in Tim Bayne, Axel Cleeremans, Patrick Wilken (eds.), ''The Oxford Companion to Consciousness'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009, pp.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y_EBsfm2R5IC&pg=PA461 461–462].</ref> The [[mind-body problem]] is simply "the perimeter of our conceptual anatomy making itself felt."<ref>Colin McGinn, ''Minds and Bodies'', Oxford University Press, 1997, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pw28fydsWkwC&pg=PA106 106].</ref> McGinn describes this as existential [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]].<ref>Colin McGinn, ''The Problem of Consciousness'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1991, p.&nbsp;87–88.<br>

===Animal rights===
McGinn is a supporter of [[animal rights]], calling our treatment of non-humans "deeply and systematically immoral."<ref>Colin McGinn, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v13/n02/colin-mcginn/eating-animals-is-wrong "Eating animals is wrong"], ''London Review of Books'', 24 January 1991.<br>

Colin McGinn, ''Moral Literacy: Or How To Do The Right Thing'', London: Duckworth, 1992, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tot9PBjLNCQC&pg=PA18 18ff].</ref> His position is that we make the mistake of seeing the non-human only in relation to the human, because of "species solipsism": the farmer sees animals as food, the pet owner as companions for humans, the activist as victims of humans, the evolutionary biologist as "gene survival machines." But "their ''esse'' is not human ''percipi''" – "The rhino looks at us with the same skewed solipsism we bring to him," McGinn writes, "and surely we do not want to be as limited in our outlook as he is." He argues that "we need to improve our ''manners''" toward animals by recognizing that they have their own lives, and that those lives ought to be respected.<ref>Vicki Croke, et al., "A Consideration of Policy Implications: A Panel Discussion," ''Social Research'', 62(3), "In the Company of Animals" conference, Fall 1995, pp.&nbsp;801–838; McGinn on pp. 804–807. {{JSTOR|40971122}}</ref>

===Novels and articles===
McGinn has regularly contributed reviews and short stories to the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' and ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'',<ref>Stuart Jeffries, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/21/highereducation.news "Enemies of thought"], ''The Guardian'', 31 December 2007; Patricia Cohen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/12/books/12feud.html "The Nature of Reasons: Two Philosophers Feud Over a Book Review"], ''The New York Times'', 12 January 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/colin-mcginn Colin McGinn], ''London Review of Books''; [http://www.nybooks.com/contributors/colin-mcginn/ Colin McGinn], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.</ref> and has written occasionally for ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''. He has also written two novels, ''The Space Trap'' (1992) and ''Bad Patches'' (2012).<ref name=cv/>

==Radio and television==
In 1984, McGinn discussed [[John Searle]]'s Reith lectures on BBC Radio Three with Searle, [[Richard Gregory]] and [[Colin Blakemore]]. The next year, he and Sir [[Andrew Huxley]] debated animal rights with [[Bernard Williams]] as the moderator.<ref name=cv/> He was interviewed for [[Jonathan Miller]]'s 2003 documentary miniseries ''[[Atheism: A Rough History of Disbelief]]'', later broadcast as ''[[The Atheism Tapes]]'' (2004),<ref>[http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/109-atheism-tapes-colin-mcginn "Atheism Tapes: Colin McGinn"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611133746/http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/109-atheism-tapes-colin-mcginn |date=11 June 2013 }}, The Richard Dawkins Foundation, 12 May 2006 ({{YouTube|o68bcH_o1Yc}}).</ref> and published an article titled "Why I am an Atheist".<ref>McGinn, Colin, [https://www.colinmcginn.net/why-i-am-an-atheist/#.Wje3bzdryUm "Why I am an Atheist"]</ref> He has also appeared in 11 episodes of ''[[Closer to Truth]]'' hosted by [[Robert Lawrence Kuhn]], discussing consciousness, personal identity, free will, and materialism.<ref>[http://www.closertotruth.com/contributor/colin-mcginn/profile "Colin McGinn"], ClosertoTruth.com</ref>
