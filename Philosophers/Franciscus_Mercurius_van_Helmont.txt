'''Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont''' (baptised 20 October 1614 – December 1698<ref>Coudert, Allison P. (1995): [https://www.academia.edu/43502179/LEIBNIZ_AND_THE_KABBALAH Leibniz and van Helmont: a chronological table, in: Leibniz and the Kabbalah. ''The International Archives of the History of Ideas'' Nr 142. Dordrecht: Kluwer pdf]</ref>) was a Flemish alchemist and writer, the son of [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]]. He is now best known for his publication in the 1640s of his father's pioneer works on [[chemistry]], which link the origins of the science to the study of [[alchemy]].

From his early work as a physician, he became a [[kabbalist]] and together with [[Henry More]] of the [[Cambridge Platonists]] he annotated [[Christian Knorr von Rosenroth]]'s translations of kabbalist texts.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Richard Popkin|editor-link=Richard Popkin|title=The Pimlico History of Western Philosophy|year=1999|page= 363|isbn=071266534X|publisher=Pimlico}}</ref>

==Contacts and movement==
He led an itinerant life in wanderings in Europe, an adjective already applied to him by [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]] in his 1711 ''[[Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times]]''.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Lawrence E. Klein |title=Shaftesbury: Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times|year=1999|page= 128|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521578922}}</ref> He self-identified as a "wandering eremite".<ref name = QK>{{cite journal|author=Allison Coudert |year=1976|title=A Quaker-Kabbalist Controversy: George Fox's Reaction to Francis Mercury van Helmont|journal= Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes|volume= 39|pages= 171–189|doi=10.2307/751137|jstor=751137}}</ref>

Franciscus van Helmont had important groups of contacts in the Netherlands, where he knew [[Adam Boreel]] and [[Serrarius]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan Israel|author-link=Jonathan Israel|title=The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477–1806|year=1995|page= 589|isbn=0198207344|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> and later in life, in 'the Lantern', the circle around the [[Rotterdam]] merchant [[Benjamin Furly]] that included [[John Locke]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Marshall|title=John Locke, Toleration and Early Enlightenment Culture: Religious Intolerance and Arguments for Religious Toleration in Early Modern and 'early Enlightenment' Europe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521129575|year=2006|page= 494}}</ref> He was an influence on [[Franciscus van den Enden]], and on the Spanish medical professor [[Juan de Cabriada]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan Israel|title=The Radical Enlightenment|year=2001|pages= 170, 530|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0191622877}}</ref> In Amsterdam around 1690 he worked out a theory to support the work [[Johann Konrad Ammann]] was doing with [[deaf]] people.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan Rée|author-link=Jonathan Rée|title=I See a Voice|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/iseevoicedeafnes00reej/page/62 62]|publisher=Metropolitan Books|isbn=0805062548|url=https://archive.org/details/iseevoicedeafnes00reej/page/62}}</ref>

He also spent much time in Germany and England. From 1644, when his father died, to 1658, when [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]] ennobled him, he was constantly involved in diplomacy for German princes and their families.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allison Coudert|title=The Impact of the Kabbalah in the Seventeenth Century: The Life and Thought of Francis Mercury Van Helmont (1614–1698)|year=1999|page= 34|isbn=9004098445|publisher=BRILL}}</ref>

==Life from 1660==
In 1661 he was in [[Kitzingen]] when he was forcibly taken by soldiers of [[Philipp Wilhelm, Elector Palatine]] to Rome and a prison of the [[Inquisition]], where he was tortured and kept for 18 months.<ref>{{Citation | last =Reinhart | first =Max | contribution =De Consolatione Philosophiae in Seventeenth-Century Germany: Translation and Reception | year =1992 | title =Translation and Translation Theory in Seventeenth-century Germany | editor-last =Hardin | editor-first =James | pages =77–8 | publisher =Rodopi }}</ref>

His first published work was a 1667 Latin treatise ''Alphabeti veri naturalis hebraici brevissima delineatio'' (usual short English title ''Alphabet of Nature'') on [[Adamic language]], which he equated with [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Grace B. Sherrer|title=Francis Mercury van Helmont: A Neglected Seventeenth-Century Contribution to the Science of Language|journal= The Review of English Studies|volume= 14|issue= 56 |year=1938|pages= 420–427|doi= 10.1093/res/os-14.56.420}}</ref> He argued that the Hebrew alphabet implicitly gave a pronunciation guide, analogous to a musical notation for the tongue and voice.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan Rée|title=I See a Voice|publisher=Metropolitan Books|isbn=0805062548|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/iseevoicedeafnes00reej/page/76 76]|url=https://archive.org/details/iseevoicedeafnes00reej/page/76}}</ref>

He was a friend of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who wrote his epitaph, and he introduced Leibniz to [[Christian Knorr von Rosenroth]] in 1671.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allison Coudert|year=1995|title=Leibniz and the Kabbalah|page=[https://archive.org/details/leibnizkabbalah00coud_2/page/6 6]|isbn=0792331141|publisher=Springer|url=https://archive.org/details/leibnizkabbalah00coud_2/page/6}}</ref> Leibniz writing in 1669 took the "Helmontians" seriously, as one of three contending groups in philosophy, the others being the traditionalist followers of [[Aristotle]], and the [[Cartesians]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Antonia LoLordo|title=Pierre Gassendi and the Birth of Early Modern Philosophy|url=https://archive.org/details/pierregassendibi00lolo_527|url-access=limited|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521866132|year=2007|page= [https://archive.org/details/pierregassendibi00lolo_527/page/n46 35]}}</ref> The Helmontians comprised remaining [[Paracelsan]]s and those who took the writings of Jan Baptist van Helmont to heart.

He came to England in 1670, meeting the king, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].<ref>[http://www.themasonictrowel.com/Articles/apendent_bodies/scottiest/the_true_history_scottish_esoteric_masonry.htm#58 Masonic quotes by Brothers]. themasonictrowel.com</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Marsha Keith Schuchard |year=2002|title=Restoring the Temple of Vision: Cabalistic Freemasonry and Stuart Culture|isbn=9004124896|publisher=BRILL|page= 677}}</ref> He was on a diplomatic mission on behalf of [[Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine]].

Through his relationship as physician to [[Anne Conway, Viscountess Conway]], he began to attend [[Quaker]] meetings, in 1675.<ref>[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/conway.html Anne Finche, Viscountess Conway (1631–1678 or 79)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024333/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/conway.html |date=20 July 2011 }}. oregonstate.edu</ref> In return he introduced her to kabbalist thought. He was resident at the old [[Ragley Hall]] from 1671 until 1679, when she died.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Daniel Garber |title=The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-century Philosophy|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory01garb |url-access=limited |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521537207|year=2003|page= [https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory01garb/page/n989 1416]}}</ref> Twenty years later, he was a figure in the [[Keithian Controversy]], a schism formed in the Quakers, in which van Helmont took the side of [[George Keith (missionary)|George Keith]] who broke away.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allison Coudert|title=The Impact of the Kabbalah in the Seventeenth Century: The Life and Thought of Francis Mercury Van Helmont (1614–1698)|isbn=9004098445|year=1999|page= 241|publisher=BRILL}}</ref> Keith had translated van Helmont's ''Two Hundred Queries'' in 1684; it was a work of speculative theology, written in Latin in a simultaneously published version and anonymous until the following year, and van Helmont had hoped for an effect on Quaker belief, at the time still plastic and uncodified. But he encountered serious resistance from [[George Fox]].<ref name = QK/><ref>{{cite book|author=Barry Levy|title=Quakers and the American Family: British Settlement in the Delaware Valley|url=https://archive.org/details/quakersamerican00levy|url-access=registration|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198021674|year=1988|page= [https://archive.org/details/quakersamerican00levy/page/164 164]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Sarah Hutton |year=2004|title=Anne Conway: A Woman Philosopher|url=https://archive.org/details/anneconwaywomanp00hutt |url-access=limited |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521109817|page= [https://archive.org/details/anneconwaywomanp00hutt/page/n215 206]}}</ref> Keith collaborated on van Helmont's ''Paradoxal Discourses'' of 1685, but went to some pains to deny he held the same opinions.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allison Coudert|year=1995|title=Leibniz and the Kabbalah|page=[https://archive.org/details/leibnizkabbalah00coud_2/page/164 164, note 129]|isbn=0792331141|publisher=Springer|url=https://archive.org/details/leibnizkabbalah00coud_2/page/164}}</ref>

In a ''A Cabbalistical Dialogue'' (Latin version first, 1677, in English 1682) he launched a defence of kabbalist metaphysics. He had been closely associated with the ''Kabbala Denudata'' of Rosenroth. The ''Dialogue'' puts matter and spirit on a continuum, describing matter as a "coalition" of [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allison Coudert|chapter=Forgotten Ways of Knowing|pages= 87–8|editor= Donald R. Kelley, Richard Henry Popkin|title=The Shapes of Knowledge from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment: From the Renaissance to the Enlightenment|publisher=Springer|isbn=9401054274|year=1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=B. J. Gibbons|title=Spirituality and the Occult: From the Renaissance to the Modern Age|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=041524448X|year=2001|page= 22}}</ref> There are various views on the evolution of the concept of "monad", which Conway and Van Helmont shared with Leibniz. Physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernhard Weinstein]] found this to be a kind of [[Pandeism]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Max Bernhard Weinsten|title=Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis|url=https://archive.org/details/WeinsteinWeltUndL|trans-title=World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Perception of Nature|year=1910| page =[https://archive.org/details/WeinsteinWeltUndL/page/n177 338]|quote=Wie er die Seele stoisch betrachtet, so hat er sich im Grunde auch eine Art Pandeismus zurecht gelegt, indem Gott zwar von allen Dingen verschieden, aber doch nicht von allen Dingen abgetrennt oder geteilt sein soll.}}</ref> From the same period, the attributed work ''Adumbratio Kabbalae Christianae'', sometimes included with the ''Kabbala Denudata'' as an anonymous essay, purported to be a tract to convert Jews to Christianity, but equally served as an introduction to [[Christian Kabbalist]] views, and the identification of [[Adam Kadmon]] of the [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] with Christ.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sheila A. Spector |year=2002|title=Wonders Divine: The Development of Blake's Kabbalistic Myth|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=0838754686 |page= 32}}</ref>

In his last years he was in Germany, and continued to work closely with Leibniz. It has been argued that Leibniz may have written the final book to appear under van Helmont's name, the ''Quaedam praemeditatae et consideratae cogitationes super quattuor capita libri primi Moisis'' (Amsterdam 1697), translated in English in 1701 as ''Premeditate and Considerate Thoughts'', on the early chapters of the ''[[Book of Genesis]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Glenn Alexander Magee |year=2001|title=Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition|url=https://archive.org/details/hegelhermetictra00mage |url-access=limited |publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801474507|page= [https://archive.org/details/hegelhermetictra00mage/page/n206 185]}}</ref>
