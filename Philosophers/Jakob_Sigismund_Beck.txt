'''Jakob Sigismund Beck''' (originally '''Jacob Sigismund Beck'''; 6 August 1761 – 29 August 1840) was a German [[philosopher]].

==Biography==
Beck was born in the village of [[Lisewo Malborskie|Liessau]] (Lisewo) in the rural district of [[Malbork|Marienburg]] (Malbork) in [[Royal Prussia]], [[Poland]] in 1761. The son of a priest (of Liessau), he studied (after 1783) [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Königsberg]], where [[Christian Jakob Kraus]], [[Johann Schultz]], and [[Immanuel Kant]] were his teachers. After his studies he first accepted a post as a teacher at a grammar school in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]]. With his thesis ''Dissertatio de Theoremate Tayloriano, sive de lege generali, secundum quam functionis mutantur, notatis a quibus pendent variabilibus'', which he wrote in Halle, he was qualified as a university lecturer. He then worked as a lecturer of philosophy at the [[University of Halle]] (1791–1799), before he became a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Rostock]]. He devoted himself to criticism and explanation of the doctrine of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and in 1793 published the ''Erläuternder Auszug aus den kritischen Schriften des Herrn Prof. Kant, auf Anrathen desselben'' ([[Riga]], 1793–1796), which has been widely used as a compendium of [[Kantian]] doctrine.<ref name=EB1911/>

Beck endeavoured to explain away certain of the contradictions which are found in Kant's system by saying that much of the language is used in a popular sense for the sake of intelligibility, e.g. where Kant attributes to [[things-in-themselves]] an existence under the conditions of time, space and causality, and yet holds that they furnish the material of our apprehensions. Beck maintains that the real meaning of Kant's theory is [[idealism]]; that knowledge of objects outside the domain of [[consciousness]] is impossible, and hence that nothing positive remains when we have removed the subjective element. Matter is deduced by the original [[Analytic–synthetic distinction|synthesis]]. Similarly, the idea of [[God]] is a [[symbol]]ic representation of the voice of [[conscience]] guiding from within. The value of Beck's exegesis has been to a great extent overlooked owing to the greater attention given to the work of [[J. G. Fichte]]. Beside the three volumes of the ''Erläuternder Auszug'', he published the ''Grundriss der kritischen Philosophie'' (1796), containing an interpretation of the Kantian ''Kritik'' in the manner of [[Salomon Maimon]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Beck, Jakob Sigismund|volume=3|page=608|inline=1}}</ref>

Beck died in [[Rostock]].
