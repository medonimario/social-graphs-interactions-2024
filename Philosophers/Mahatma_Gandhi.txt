'''Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi''' ([[ISO 15919|ISO]]: ''Mōhanadāsa Karamacaṁda Gāṁdhī'';{{efn|Pronounced variously {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|n|d|i|,_|ˈ|ɡ|æ|n|d|i}} {{Respell|GA(H)N|dee}},<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gandhi "Gandhi"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114041417/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gandhi |date=14 January 2015}} ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA|gu|ˈmoɦəndɑs ˈkəɾəmtʃənd ˈɡɑ̃dʱi|lang}}}} 2 October 1869{{Snd}}30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, [[Anti-colonial nationalism|anti-colonial nationalist]], and [[Political ethics|political ethicist]] who employed [[nonviolent resistance]] to lead the successful [[Indian independence movement|campaign for India's independence]] from [[British Raj|British rule]]. He inspired movements for [[Civil rights movements|civil rights]] and freedom across the world. The honorific '''[[Mahātmā]]''' ({{langx|sa|महात्मा}}, meaning great-souled/venerable), first applied to him in [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] in 1914, is now used throughout the world.<ref>{{cite book|author= K.P. Goswami |date=1971 |title=Mahatma Gandhi:A Chronology |publisher=Publications Division, Government of India}} Entry for 9 July 1914.</ref>

Born and raised in a [[Hindu]] family in coastal [[Gujarat]], Gandhi trained in the law at the [[Inner Temple]] in London and was [[called to the bar]] in June 1891, at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. There, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land-tax.

Assuming leadership of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending [[untouchability]], and, above all, achieving ''[[swaraj]]'' or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short ''[[dhoti]]'' woven with [[Charkha (spinning wheel)|hand-spun]] yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a [[Sabarmati Ashram|self-sufficient residential community]], to eat simple food, and undertake [[List of fasts undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi|long fasts]] as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed [[Salt tax#Impacted regions|salt tax]] with the {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Salt March|Dandi Salt March]] in 1930 and in calling for the British to [[Quit India Movement|quit India]] in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.

Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on [[religious pluralism]] was challenged in the early 1940s by a [[Muslim nationalism in South Asia|Muslim nationalism]] which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within [[British India]]. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was [[Partition of India|partitioned]] into two [[dominion]]s, a Hindu-majority [[Dominion of India|India]] and a Muslim-majority [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and [[Sikh]]s made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]]. Abstaining from the [[Independence Day (India)|official celebration of independence]], Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several [[hunger strike]]s to stop the religious violence. The last of these was begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948, when Gandhi was 78. The belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and [[Indian Muslim]]s spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was [[Nathuram Godse]], a militant [[Hindu nationalist]] from [[Pune]], western India, who [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassinated Gandhi]] by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. 

Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as [[Gandhi Jayanti]], a [[Public holidays in India|national holiday]], and worldwide as the [[International Day of Non-Violence|International Day of Nonviolence]]. Gandhi is considered to be the [[Father of the Nation]] in post-colonial India. During India's nationalist movement and in several decades immediately after, he was also commonly called ''Bapu'', an endearment roughly meaning "father".<!--Do NOT add citations to the lead, except for material likely to be challenged, per [[MOS:LEADCITE]] ([[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#Citations)]].

== Early life and background ==

=== Parents ===
Gandhi's father, [[Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi]] (1822–1885), served as the ''[[dewan]]'' (chief minister) of Porbandar state.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gandhi |first=Mohandas K. |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=in3_3H1szHYC&pg=PA21 |title=An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth |publisher=The Floating Press |isbn=978-1-77541-405-6 |page=21 |access-date=29 March 2024 |archive-date=29 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240329130538/https://books.google.com/books?id=in3_3H1szHYC&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="GangulyDocker20082">{{cite book |title=Rethinking Gandhi and Nonviolent Relationality: Global Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cId9AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA4 |pages=4– |year=2008 |editor-last=Ganguly |editor-first=Debjani |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-1-134-07431-0 |editor-last2=Docker |editor-first2=John |access-date=21 July 2019 |archive-date=21 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230721085146/https://books.google.com/books?id=cId9AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA4 |url-status=live |quote=... marks Gandhi as a hybrid cosmopolitan figure who transformed ... anti-colonial nationalist politics in the twentieth-century in ways that neither indigenous nor westernized Indian nationalists could.}}</ref> His family originated from the then village of [[Kutiyana|Kutiana]] in what was then [[Junagadh State]].{{sfnp|Guha|2015|pp=19–21}} Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, he proved a capable chief minister.{{sfnp|Guha|2015|pp=19–21}}

During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh,{{sfnp|Guha|2015|pp=19–21}} and was from a [[Pranami]] [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] family.<ref>{{cite book |author=Misra, Amalendu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLgB8pZg0qsC&pg=PA67 |title=Identity and Religion: Foundations of anti-Islamism in India |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7619-3227-7 |page=67}}</ref>{{sfnp|Gandhi|2007a|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TEyXCoc76AEC&pg=PA5 5]}}<ref>{{cite book |author=Malhotra, S.L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRq21fNfydIC&pg=PA5 |title=Lawyer to Mahatma: Life, Work and Transformation of M.

In 1874, Gandhi's father, Karamchand, left Porbandar for the smaller state of [[Rajkot]], where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the state's ''diwan'' a measure of security.{{sfnp|Guha|2015|pp=24–25}} In 1876, Karamchand became ''diwan'' of Rajkot and was succeeded as ''diwan'' of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas.

=== Childhood ===
As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears."{{sfnp|Guha|2015|p=22}} The Indian classics, especially the stories of [[Shravana Kumara|Shravana]] and king [[Harishchandra]], had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, Gandhi states that they left an indelible impression on his mind. Gandhi writes: "It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.<ref name="Sorokin2002" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Rudolph |first1=Susanne Hoeber |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fi6GDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA48 |title=Gandhi: The Traditional Roots of Charisma |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-226-73136-0 |page=48 |last2=Rudolph |first2=Lloyd I. |name-list-style=amp |access-date=19 March 2023 |archive-date=7 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241007224423/https://books.google.com/books?id=Fi6GDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA48#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

The family's religious background was eclectic. Mohandas was born into a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Hindu]] [[Modh]] [[Bania (caste)|Bania]] family.<ref>{{harvp|Guha|2014a|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XS7UAAAAQBAJ&q=%22the+subcaste+the+Gandhis+belonged+to+was+known+as+Modh+Bania,+the+prefix%22&pg=PP42 42]}}.

At the age of nine, Gandhi entered the local school in [[Rajkot]], near his home. There, he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography.{{sfnp|Guha|2015|pp=24–25}} At the age of 11, Gandhi joined the High School in Rajkot, [[Alfred High School (Rajkot)|Alfred High School]].{{sfnp|Guha|2015|pp=25–26}} He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue-tied student, with no interest in games; Gandhi's only companions were books and school lessons.{{sfnp|Ghose|1991|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5l0BPnxN1h8C&pg=PA4 4]}}

=== Marriage ===
In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas Gandhi was married to 14-year-old [[Kasturba Gandhi|Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia]] (her first name was usually shortened to "Kasturba", and affectionately to "Ba") in an [[arranged marriage]], according to the custom of the region at that time.<ref name="Mohanty2011" /> In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies.<ref name="Childhood">{{cite web |last=Gandhi |first=Mohandas K. |year=1940 |title=At the High School |url=http://wikilivres.org/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth/Part_I/At_the_High_School |access-date=20 February 2023 |website=[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]] |publisher=Wikilivres |archive-date=7 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307155915/http://wikilivres.org/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth/Part_I/At_the_High_School |url-status=live}}</ref> Gandhi's wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, Gandhi once said, "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband.<ref name="Husband">{{cite web |last=Gandhi |first=Mohandas K. |year=1940 |title=Playing the Husband |url=http://wikilivres.org/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth/Part_I/Playing_the_Husband |access-date=20 February 2023 |website=[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]] |publisher=Wikilivres |archive-date=7 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307155915/http://wikilivres.org/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth/Part_I/Playing_the_Husband |url-status=live }}</ref>

Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride by saying, "Even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me." Gandhi later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when Kasturba would visit a temple with her girlfriends and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.{{sfnp|Guha|2015|pp=28–29}}

In late 1885, Gandhi's father, Karamchand, died.{{sfnp|Guha|2015|p=29}} Gandhi had left his father's bedside to be with his wife mere minutes before his passing. Many decades later Gandhi wrote "if animal passion had not blinded me. I should have been spared the torture of separation from my father during his last moments."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gandhi |first=M.

The two deaths anguished Gandhi.{{sfnp|Guha|2015|p=29}} The Gandhi couple had four more children, all sons: [[Harilal Gandhi|Harilal]], born in 1888; [[Manilal Gandhi|Manilal]], born in 1892; [[Ramdas Gandhi|Ramdas]], born in 1897; and [[Devdas Gandhi|Devdas]], born in 1900.<ref name="Mohanty2011" />

In November 1887, the 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school in [[Ahmedabad]].{{sfnp|Guha|2015|p=30}} In January 1888, he enrolled at [[Samaldas College]] in [[Bhavnagar State]], then the sole degree-granting institution of higher education in the region. However, Gandhi dropped out, and returned to his family in Porbandar.{{sfnp|Guha|2015|p=32}}

Outside school Gandhi's education was enriched by exposure to Gujarati literature especially reformers like [[Narmad]] and [[Govardhanram Tripathi]], whose works alerted the Gujaratis to their own faults and weaknesses such as belief in religious dogmatism.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Guha |first=Ramachandra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arDvngEACAAJ |title=Gandhi Before India |date=2014 |publisher=Alfred A.

Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.{{sfnp|Guha|2015|p=32}}{{sfnp|Gandhi|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FauJL7LKXmkC&pg=PA20 20–21]}}

On 10 August 1888, Gandhi, aged 18, left Porbandar for Mumbai, then known as Bombay. A local newspaper covering the farewell function by his old high school in Rajkot noted that Gandhi was the first Bania from Kathiawar to proceed to England for his Barrister Examination.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Guha |first=Ramachandra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arDvngEACAAJ |title=Gandhi Before India |date=2014 |publisher=Alfred A.

Despite Gandhi informing them of his promise to his mother and her blessings, Gandhi was excommunicated from his caste. Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London, with his brother seeing him off.<ref name="Turban" />{{sfnp|Guha|2015|pp=33–34}} Gandhi attended [[University College, London]], where he took classes in English literature with [[Henry Morley]] in 1888–1889.<ref>{{cite news |last=Swapnajit Mitra |date=12 October 2014 |title=My Experiment with Truth |work=[[India Currents]] |url=https://indiacurrents.com/my-experiment-with-truth/ |access-date=16 January 2023 |archive-date=16 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230116214150/https://indiacurrents.com/my-experiment-with-truth/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Gandhi also enrolled at the [[City Law School|Inns of Court School of Law]] in [[Inner Temple]] with the intention of becoming a [[barrister]].<ref name="B. R. Nanda"/> His childhood shyness and self-withdrawal had continued through his teens. Gandhi retained these traits when he arrived in London, but joined a public speaking practice group and overcame his shyness sufficiently to practise law.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thomas Weber |url=https://archive.org/details/gandhiasdisciple0000webe |title=Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-139-45657-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gandhiasdisciple0000webe/page/19 19]–25 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

Gandhi demonstrated a keen interest in the welfare of London's impoverished dockland communities. In 1889, a [[London dock strike, 1889|bitter trade dispute]] broke out in London, with dockers striking for better pay and conditions, and seamen, shipbuilders, factory girls and other joining the strike in solidarity. The strikers were successful, in part due to the mediation of [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], leading Gandhi and an Indian friend to make a point of visiting the cardinal and thanking him for his work.<ref>{{cite web |title=Narayan Hemchandra &#124; Gandhi Autobiography or The Story of My Experiments with Truth |url=https://www.mkgandhi.org/autobio/chap22.htm |access-date=20 February 2023 |website=www.mkgandhi.org |archive-date=15 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515111533/https://www.mkgandhi.org/autobio/chap22.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Vegetarianism and committee work ===
His vow to his mother influenced Gandhi's time in London. Gandhi tried to adopt "English" customs, including taking dancing lessons.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tendulkar |first=Dinanath Gopal |title=Mahatma: 1920-1929 |date=2 September 2008 |publisher=Vithalbhai K. Javeri & D.G. Tendulkar, 1951 |location=the University of Michigan |pages=463}}</ref> However, he didn't appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by [[Henry Stephens Salt|Henry Salt's]] writing, Gandhi joined the [[Vegetarian Society|London Vegetarian Society]] (LVS) and was elected to its executive committee under the aegis of its president and benefactor [[Arnold Hills]].{{sfnp|Brown|1991|p={{pn|date=July 2024}}}} An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a [[Bayswater]] chapter.<ref name="Tendulkar1951" /> Some of the vegetarians Gandhi met were members of the [[Theosophical Society]], which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the [[Bhagavad Gita]] both in translation as well as in the original.{{sfnp|Brown|1991|p={{pn|date=July 2024}}}}

Gandhi had a friendly and productive relationship with Hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued LVS membership of fellow committee member [[Thomas Allinson]]. Their disagreement is the first known example of Gandhi challenging authority, despite his shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation.{{Cn|date=September 2024}}

Allinson had been promoting [[Birth control#Birth control movement|newly available birth control methods]], but Hills disapproved of these, believing they undermined public morality. He believed [[History of vegetarianism#19th century|vegetarianism to be a moral movement]] and that Allinson should therefore no longer remain a member of the LVS. Gandhi shared Hills' views on the dangers of birth control, but defended Allinson's right to differ.<ref name="shyness">{{Cite web |date=1927 |title=Shyness my shield |url=https://www.mkgandhi.org/autobio/chap18.htm |website=Autobiography |access-date=11 August 2019 |archive-date=8 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608201409/https://www.mkgandhi.org/autobio/chap18.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> It would have been hard for Gandhi to challenge Hills; Hills was 12 years his senior and unlike Gandhi, highly eloquent. Hills bankrolled the LVS and was a [[captain of industry]] with his [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]] company employing more than 6,000 people in the [[East End of London]]. Hills was also a highly accomplished sportsman who later founded the football club [[West Ham United]]. In his 1927 ''An Autobiography, Vol. I'', Gandhi wrote:

{{blockquote| The question deeply interested me...I had a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity. But I thought it was quite improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because he refused to regard puritan morals as one of the objects of the society<ref name="shyness" />}}

A motion to remove Allinson was raised, and was debated and voted on by the committee. Gandhi's shyness was an obstacle to his defence of Allinson at the committee meeting. Gandhi wrote his views down on paper, but shyness prevented Gandhi from reading out his arguments, so Hills, the President, asked another committee member to read them out for him. Although some other members of the committee agreed with Gandhi, the vote was lost and Allinson was excluded. There were no hard feelings, with Hills proposing the toast at the LVS farewell dinner in honour of Gandhi's return to India.<ref>{{cite web |title=International Vegetarian Union – Mohandas K.

=== Called to the bar ===
Gandhi, at age 22, was [[called to the bar]] in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned that his mother had died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from Gandhi.{{sfnp|Brown|1991|p={{pn|date=July 2024}}}} His attempts at establishing a law practice in [[Bombay]] failed because Gandhi was psychologically unable to [[cross-examine]] witnesses. He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but Gandhi was forced to stop after running afoul of British officer Sam Sunny.{{sfnp|Brown|1991|p={{pn|date=July 2024}}}}<ref name="Tendulkar1951" />

In 1893, a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah contacted Gandhi. Abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in South Africa. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of £105 (~$4,143 in 2023 money) plus travel expenses. He accepted it, knowing that it would be at least a one-year commitment in the [[Colony of Natal]], South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.<ref name="Tendulkar1951" />{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=82–83}}

Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination due to his skin colour and heritage.<ref name="Parekh2001" /> Gandhi was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and was told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere, Gandhi was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at [[Pietermaritzburg]] after refusing to leave the first-class.<ref name="Turban" />{{sfnp|Dhiman|2016|pp=25–27}} Gandhi sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights.{{sfnp|Dhiman|2016|pp=25–27}} Gandhi chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day.{{sfnp|Gandhi|2002|p={{pn|date=July 2024}}}} In another incident, the magistrate of a [[Durban]] court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do.<ref name="Turban" /> Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.<ref name="Turban" />

When Gandhi arrived in South Africa, according to Arthur Herman, he thought of himself as "a Briton first, and an Indian second."{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=87–88}} However, the prejudice against Gandhi and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him. Gandhi found it humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour or superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices.{{sfnp|Dhiman|2016|pp=25–27}} Gandhi began to question his people's standing in the [[British Empire]].<ref name="Allen2011">{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Jeremiah |year=2011 |title=Sleeping with Strangers: A Vagabond's Journey Tramping the Globe |page=273 |publisher=Other Places Publishing |isbn=978-1-935850-01-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyl8f54UToQC&pg=PT273 |access-date=29 March 2024 |archive-date=29 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240329130651/https://books.google.com/books?id=vyl8f54UToQC&pg=PT273 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The Abdullah case that had brought him to South Africa concluded in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi as he prepared to return to India.{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=88–89}} The farewell party was turned into a working committee to plan the resistance to a new Natal government discriminatory proposal.  This led to  Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. Gandhi planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to [[Disfranchisement|deny them the right to vote]], a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked [[Joseph Chamberlain]], the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill.<ref name="Gandhi" /> Though unable to halt the bill's passage, Gandhi's campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the [[Natal Indian Congress]] in 1894,<ref name="Tendulkar1951" />{{sfnp|Gandhi|2002|p={{pn|date=July 2024}}}} and through this organisation, Gandhi moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him,<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi |chapter=March 1897 Memorial |wslink=The_Collected_Works_of_Mahatma_Gandhi/Volume_II}}: correspondence and newspaper accounts of the incident.</ref> and Gandhi escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent.{{Cn|date=July 2024}}  However, Gandhi refused to press charges against any member of the mob.<ref name="Tendulkar1951" />

[[File:Gandhi Boer War.jpg|thumb|Gandhi (middle, third from right) with the stretcher-bearers of the [[Indian Ambulance Corps]] during the [[Boer War]]]]

During the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], Gandhi volunteered in 1900 to form a group of stretcher-bearers as the [[Natal Indian Ambulance Corps]]. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi wanted to disprove the British colonial stereotype that Hindus were not fit for "manly" activities involving danger and exertion, unlike the Muslim "[[martial race]]s."{{sfnp|Herman|2008|p=125}} Gandhi raised 1,100 Indian volunteers to support British combat troops against the Boers. They were trained and medically certified to serve on the front lines. They were auxiliaries at the [[Battle of Colenso]] to a White volunteer ambulance corps. At the [[Battle of Spion Kop]], Gandhi and his bearers moved to the front line and had to carry wounded soldiers for miles to a field hospital since the terrain was too rough for the ambulances. Gandhi and 37 other Indians received the [[Queen's South Africa Medal]].{{sfnp|Herman|2008|loc=chapter 6}}<ref name="medals_south_african">{{cite web |date=5 March 1949 |title=South African Medals that Mahatma Returned Put on View at Gandhi Mandap Exhibition |website=Press Information Bureau of India – Archive |url=http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/ArchiveSecondPhase/DEFENCE/1949-JAN-DEC-DEFENCE/PDF/DEF-1949-02-24_076.pdf |access-date=18 July 2020 |archive-date=28 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928203725/http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/ArchiveSecondPhase/DEFENCE/1949-JAN-DEC-DEFENCE/PDF/DEF-1949-02-24_076.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1906, the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian and Chinese populations.

=== Europeans, Indians and Africans ===
Gandhi focused his attention on Indians and Africans while he was in South Africa. Initially, Gandhi was not interested in politics, but this changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach due to his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with [[White South African|Whites in South Africa]], Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. Gandhi entered politics by forming the Natal Indian Congress.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Constance |last2=Ryan |first2=James |title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&pg=PA158 |publisher=Facts On File |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=158–159 |isbn=978-0-8160-5458-9 |access-date=5 July 2024 |archive-date=7 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241007224940/https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&pg=PA158#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious in some cases. He suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied Gandhi his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called Gandhi a "parasite", "semi-barbarous", "canker", "squalid coolie", "yellow man", and other epithets. People would even spit on him as an expression of racial hate.<ref name="Desai2015p26"/>

[[File:Indian_opinion_advertisement_in_1910.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Advertisement of the ''[[Indian Opinion]]'', a newspaper founded by Gandhi]]

While in South Africa, Gandhi focused on the racial persecution of Indians before he started to focus on racism against Africans. In some cases, state Desai and Vahed, Gandhi's behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and African exploitation.<ref name="Desai2015p26"/> During a speech in September 1896, Gandhi complained that the whites in the British colony of South Africa were "degrading the Indian to the level of a raw [[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffir]]."<ref>{{cite book |last=DiSalvo |first=Charles R. |title=M.K.

Gandhi cited race history and European Orientalists' opinions that "Anglo-Saxons and Indians are sprung from the same Aryan stock or rather the Indo-European peoples" and argued that Indians should not be grouped with the Africans.{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=88–89}}

Years later, Gandhi and his colleagues served and helped Africans as nurses and by opposing racism.

In 1903, Gandhi started the ''Indian Opinion'', a journal that carried news of Indians in South Africa, Indians in India with articles on all subjects -social, moral and intellectual. Each issue was multi-lingual and carried material in English, Gujarati, Hindi and Tamil. It carried ads, depended heavily on Gandhi's contributions (often printed without a byline) and was an 'advocate' for the Indian cause.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Guha |first=Ramachandra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arDvngEACAAJ |title=Gandhi Before India |date=2014 |publisher=Alfred A.

In 1906, when the [[Bambatha Rebellion]] broke out in the [[colony of Natal]], the then 36-year-old Gandhi, despite sympathising with the Zulu rebels, encouraged Indian South Africans to form a volunteer stretcher-bearer unit.{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=136–137}} Writing in the ''[[Indian Opinion]]'', Gandhi argued that military service would be beneficial to the Indian community and claimed it would give them "health and happiness."{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=154–157, 280–281}} Gandhi eventually led a volunteer mixed unit of Indian and African stretcher-bearers to treat wounded combatants during the suppression of the rebellion.{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=136–137}}

[[File:Gandhi suit.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.85|Gandhi photographed in South Africa (1909)]]

The medical unit commanded by Gandhi operated for less than two months before being disbanded.{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=136–137}} After the suppression of the rebellion, the colonial establishment showed no interest in extending to the Indian community the civil rights granted to [[white South Africans]]. This led Gandhi to becoming disillusioned with the Empire and aroused a spiritual awakening within him; historian [[Arthur L.

By 1910, Gandhi's newspaper, ''Indian Opinion'', was covering reports on discrimination against Africans by the colonial regime.

== Struggle for Indian independence (1915–1947) ==
{{See also|Indian independence movement}}

At the request of [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], conveyed to Gandhi by [[Charles Freer Andrews|C. F. Andrews]], Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.

Gandhi joined the [[Indian National Congress]] and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British [[Whiggism|Whiggish]] traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.<ref name="Whiggism" />

Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration, but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942, and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947, the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.{{sfnp|Markovits|2002|pp=367–386}}

=== Role in World War I ===
{{See also|Indian Army during World War I|label 1=The role of India in World War I}}

In April 1918, during the latter part of [[World War I]], the [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Viceroy]] invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi.<ref>[[s:Chronology of Mahatma Gandhi's life/India 1918|Chronology of Mahatma Gandhi's Life:India 1918]] in WikiSource based on the [[s:The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi|Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi]].

In a June 1918 leaflet entitled "Appeal for Enlistment", Gandhi wrote: "To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them... If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army."<ref name="CollectedWorks17b">Gandhi (1965), ''Collected Works'', [http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL017.PDF Vol 17.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015235028/http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL017.PDF |date=15 October 2009}} Chapter "67.

Gandhi's support for the war campaign brought into question his consistency on nonviolence. [[Mahadev Desai|Gandhi's private secretary]] noted that "The question of the consistency between his creed of '[[Ahimsa]]' (nonviolence) and his recruiting campaign was raised not only then but has been discussed ever since."<ref name="wikilivres.ca" /> According to political and educational scientist Christian Bartolf, Gandhi's support for the war stemmed from his belief that true ahimsa could not exist simultaneously with cowardice. Therefore, Gandhi felt that Indians needed to be willing and capable of using arms before they voluntarily chose non-violence.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bartolf |first=Christian |date=22 August 2013 |title=Gandhi and War: The Mahatma Gandhi / Bart de Ligt Correspondence |url=https://www.satyagrahafoundation.org/gandhi-and-war-the-mahatma-gandhi-bart-de-ligt-correspondence |website=Satyagraha Foundation |access-date=5 February 2024 |archive-date=5 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240205071823/https://www.satyagrahafoundation.org/gandhi-and-war-the-mahatma-gandhi-bart-de-ligt-correspondence/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In July 1918, Gandhi said that he could not persuade even one individual to enlist for the world war. "So far I have not a single recruit to my credit apart," Gandhi wrote.

=== Champaran agitations ===
{{Main|Champaran Satyagraha}}
[[File:Gandhi Kheda 1918.jpg|thumb|Gandhi in 1918, at the time of the Kheda and Champaran Satyagrahas]]

Gandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the [[Champaran]] agitation in [[Bihar]]. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against largely Anglo-Indian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration. The peasants were forced to grow indigo (''[[Indigofera]]'' sp.), a cash crop for [[Indigo dye]] whose demand had been declining over two decades and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his [[ashram]] in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.<ref name="Hardiman2001" />

=== Kheda agitations ===
{{main|Kheda Satyagraha}}
In 1918, [[Kheda]] was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to [[Nadiad]],<ref name="Laboratory">{{cite web |year=2004 |title=Satyagraha Laboratories of Mahatma Gandhi |url=http://www.aicc.org.in/satyagraha_laboratories_of_mahatma_gandhi.htm |access-date=25 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206050856/http://www.aicc.org.in/satyagraha_laboratories_of_mahatma_gandhi.htm |archive-date=6 December 2006 |website=[[Indian National Congress]] website |publisher=[[All India Congress Committee]]}}</ref> organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being [[Vallabhbhai Patel]].{{sfnp|Gandhi|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FauJL7LKXmkC&pg=196 196–197]}} Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of ''mamlatdars'' and ''talatdars'' (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused, but by the end of May 1918, the government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.<ref name="Brown1974" />

=== Khilafat movement ===
{{main|Khilafat Movement}}
In 1919, following World War I, Gandhi (aged 49) sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the [[Ottoman Empire]] that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917–18. Gandhi had already vocally supported the British crown in the first world war.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nojeim |first=M. |title=Gandhi and King: The Power of Nonviolent Resistance |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-275-96574-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g9a5AAAAIAAJ |page=75 |access-date=3 February 2024 |archive-date=3 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240203075416/https://books.google.com/books?id=g9a5AAAAIAAJ |url-status=live}}</ref> This decision of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with ''swaraj'' (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I.<ref name="robbins133">{{cite book |last=Keith Robbins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qnTq4w-Ny3oC |title=The First World War |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-19-280318-4 |pages=133–137}}</ref> The British government had offered, instead of self-government, minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi.<ref name="green89">{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=Michael J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xHnDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA89 |title=A Global History of the Twentieth Century: Legacies and Lessons from Six National Perspectives |last2=Nicholas Szechenyi |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-4422-7972-8 |pages=89–90}}</ref> He announced his ''satyagraha'' (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the [[Rowlatt Act]], to block Gandhi's movement.

Gandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the [[Khilafat movement]], wherein [[Sunni]] Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish [[Caliph]] as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (''[[ummah]]''). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of [[Ottoman Empire]] in World War I.{{sfnp|Minault|1982|pp=4–8}}<ref name="paine20">{{cite book |last=Sarah C.M.

The increasing Muslim support for Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt ''satyagraha'' demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature as the political leader to the British.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bose, Sugata |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMJIuHL9ksAC&pg=PA112 |title=Modern South History, Culture, Political Economy |last2=Jalal, Ayesha |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-203-71253-5 |pages=112–14 |name-list-style=amp}}</ref>{{sfnp|Brown|1991|pp=140–147}} His support for the Khilafat movement also helped Gandhi sideline [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], who had announced his opposition to the ''satyagraha'' non-co-operation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan. Though they agreed in general terms on Indian independence, they disagreed on the means of achieving this.

In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable communication that if the British were to pass the [[Rowlatt Act]], he would appeal to Indians to start civil disobedience.{{sfnp|Wolpert|2002a|pp=99–103}} The British government ignored him and passed the law, stating it would not yield to threats. The ''satyagraha'' civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in ''satyagraha'' in Delhi.{{sfnp|Wolpert|2002a|pp=99–103}}

People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, Gandhi asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but to express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they owned. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side used violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him not to enter Delhi, but Gandhi defied the order and was arrested on 9 April.{{sfnp|Wolpert|2002a|pp=99–103}}

On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and [[British Indian Army]] officer [[Reginald Edward Harry Dyer|Reginald Dyer]] surrounded them and ordered troops under his command to fire on them. The resulting [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent but was supported by some Britons and parts of the British media as a necessary response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using 'love' to deal with the 'hate' of the British government.{{sfnp|Wolpert|2002a|pp=99–103}} Gandhi demanded that the Indian people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gandhi |first=Mohandas Karamchand |title=An Autobiography or The Story of My Experiments With Truth |title-link=The Story of My Experiments with Truth |publisher=Navajivan Publishing House |year=1940 |isbn=0-8070-5909-9 |edition=2nd |location=Ahmedabad |page=[https://archive.org/details/autobiographyst00gand/page/82 82]}} Also available at [[s:An Autobiography or The Story of my Experiments with Truth|Wikisource]].</ref>

The massacre and Gandhi's non-violent response to it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott.{{sfnp|Wolpert|2002a|pp=99–103}} The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi to the belief that Indians will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to ''swaraj'' and political independence for India.<ref name="Chakrabarty2008">{{Cite book |last=Chakrabarty |first=Bidyut |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzQHZ178C24C&pg=PA154 |title=Indian Politics and Society since Independence: events, processes and ideology |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-415-40868-4 |page=154 |access-date=4 April 2012 |archive-date=7 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241007230049/https://books.google.com/books?id=QzQHZ178C24C&pg=PA154 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress.{{sfnp|Ghose|1991|p=161–164}} He reorganised the Congress.

[[File:Gandhi spinning.jpg|left|thumb|Gandhi spinning yarn]]

Gandhi expanded his nonviolent non-co-operation platform to include the [[Swadeshi movement|''swadeshi'' policy]] – the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that ''[[khadi]]'' (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning ''khadi'' in support of the independence movement.{{sfnp|Gandhi|1990a|p=89}} In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake [[British honours system|British titles and honours]]. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.{{sfnp|Shashi|1996|p=9}}

The appeal of "Non-cooperation" grew, its social popularity drew participation from all strata of Indian society. Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He began his sentence on 18 March 1922. With Gandhi isolated in prison, the Indian National Congress split into two factions, one led by [[Chitta Ranjan Das]] and [[Motilal Nehru]] favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]] and [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], opposing this move.{{sfnp|Gandhi|1990a|p=131}} Furthermore, co-operation among Hindus and Muslims ended as Khilafat movement collapsed with the rise of Atatürk in Turkey. Muslim leaders left the Congress and began forming Muslim organisations. The political base behind Gandhi had broken into factions.

After his early release from prison for political crimes in 1924, Gandhi continued to pursue ''swaraj'' over the second half of the 1920s. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India [[dominion]] status or face a new campaign of non-cooperation with complete independence for the country as its goal.{{sfnp|Gandhi|1990|p=172}} After Gandhi's support for World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and [[Bhagat Singh]] questioned his values and non-violent approach.<ref name="paine20" />{{sfnp|Ghose|1991|p=199–204}} While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two.{{sfnp|Gandhi|1990|p=172}}

The British did not respond favourably to Gandhi's proposal. British political leaders such as Lord Birkenhead and [[Winston Churchill]] announced opposition to "the appeasers of Gandhi" in their discussions with European diplomats who sympathised with Indian demands.{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=419–420}} On 31 December 1929, an Indian flag was unfurled in [[Lahore]]. Gandhi led Congress in a celebration on 26 January 1930 of [[Independence Day (India)|India's Independence Day]] in Lahore. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. Gandhi then launched a new Satyagraha against the British salt tax in March 1930. He sent an ultimatum in the form of a letter personally addressed to Lord Irwin, the viceroy of India, on 2 March. Gandhi condemned British rule in the letter, describing it as "a curse" that "has impoverished the dumb millions by a system of progressive exploitation and by a ruinously expensive military and civil administration... It has reduced us politically to serfdom." Gandhi also mentioned in the letter that the viceroy received a salary "over five thousand times India's average income." In the letter, Gandhi also stressed his continued adherence to non-violent forms of protest.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bakshi, S. R. |title=Gandhi and Gandhi and the Mass Movement |publisher=New Delhi |year=1988 |pages=133–34}}</ref>

This was highlighted by the Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where, together with 78 volunteers, Gandhi marched {{convert|388|km|mi}} from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself, with the declared intention of breaking the salt laws. The march took 25 days to cover 240 miles with Gandhi speaking to often huge crowds along the way. Thousands of Indians joined him in Dandi. 

According to Sarma, Gandhi recruited women to participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life.<ref name="Sarma1994" /> However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because Gandhi feared he would be accused of using women as a political shield.<ref name="french219" /> When women insisted on joining the movement and participating in public demonstrations, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him.<ref name="suruchi77">{{Cite book |last=Suruchi Thapar-Bjorkert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OyILUFU1NQC&pg=PA77 |title=Women in the Indian National Movement: Unseen Faces and Unheard Voices, 1930–42 |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7619-3407-3 |pages=77–79}}</ref> Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. On 5 May, Gandhi was interned under a regulation dating from 1827 in anticipation of a protest that he had planned. The protest at Dharasana salt works on 21 May went ahead without Gandhi. A horrified American journalist, [[Webb Miller (journalist)|Webb Miller]], described the British response thus:

{{blockquote|In complete silence the Gandhi men drew up and halted a hundred yards from the stockade. A picked column advanced from the crowd, waded the ditches and approached the barbed wire stockade... at a word of command, scores of native policemen rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on their heads with their steel-shot lathis [long bamboo sticks]. Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off blows. They went down like ninepins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whack of the clubs on unprotected skulls... Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing with fractured skulls or broken shoulders.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fischer, L. |title=Gandhi and the Mass Movement |year=1950 |pages=298–99}}</ref>}}

This went on for hours until some 300 or more protesters had been beaten, many seriously injured and two killed. At no time did they offer any resistance. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in the manner Gandhi inspired.<ref name="french219">{{Cite book |last=Marilyn French |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hyr9pwbqeqoC |title=From Eve to Dawn, A History of Women in the World, Volume IV: Revolutions and Struggles for Justice in the 20th Century |publisher=City University of New York Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-55861-628-8 |pages=219–20}}</ref>

=== Gandhi as folk hero ===
[[File:Indian workers on strike in support of Mahatma Gandhi in 1930.jpg|thumb|Indian workers on strike in support of Gandhi in 1930]]

Indian Congress in the 1920s appealed to [[Andhra Pradesh]] peasants by creating Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a [[messiah]], a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.<ref name="Murali1985" />

According to Dennis Dalton, it was Gandhi's ideas that were responsible for his wide following. Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by "brute force and immorality", contrasting it with his categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by "soul force and morality."{{sfnp|Dalton|2012|pp=8–14, 20–23, 30–35}} Gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning "hate with love." These ideas are evidenced in his pamphlets from the 1890s, in South Africa, where too Gandhi was popular among the Indian [[Indian indenture system|indentured workers]]. After he returned to India, people flocked to Gandhi because he reflected their values.{{sfnp|Dalton|2012|pp=8–14, 20–23, 30–35}}

[[File:Gandhi first visit to Odisha.jpg|thumb| Gandhi's first visit to [[Odisha]] in 1921, a general meeting held at the riverbed of Kathajodi]]

Gandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used terminology and phrases such as ''[[Rama]]-rajya'' from ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Prahlada]] as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of ''swaraj'' and ''satyagraha''.{{sfnp|Dhiman|2016|pp=46–49}} During Gandhi's lifetime, these ideas sounded strange outside India, but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his people.{{sfnp|Dalton|2012|pp=8–14, 20–23, 30–35}}<ref>{{Cite book |last1=John M Levine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrQ5DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA73 |title=Encyclopedia of Group Processes and Intergroup Relations |last2=Michael A.

=== Negotiations ===
The government, represented by [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]], decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The [[Gandhi–Irwin Pact]] was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all [[political prisoner]]s, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon]], took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C&pg=PA375 375–377]}}

In Britain, [[Winston Churchill]], a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of Gandhi and opponent of his long-term plans. Churchill often ridiculed Gandhi, saying in a widely reported 1931 speech:

{{blockquote|It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace....to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.{{sfnp|Herman|2008|p=359}}}}

Churchill's bitterness against Gandhi grew in the 1930s. He called Gandhi as the one who was "seditious in aim" whose evil genius and multiform menace was attacking the British empire. Churchill called him a dictator, a "Hindu [[Mussolini]]", fomenting a race war, trying to replace the Raj with [[Brahmin]] cronies, playing on the ignorance of Indian masses, all for selfish gain.{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=378–381}} Churchill attempted to isolate Gandhi, and his criticism of Gandhi was widely covered by European and American press. It gained Churchill sympathetic support, but it also increased support for Gandhi among Europeans. The developments heightened Churchill's anxiety that the "British themselves would give up out of pacifism and misplaced conscience."{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=378–381}}

=== Round Table Conferences ===
[[File:Mahadev Desai and Gandhi 2 1939.jpg|thumb|Gandhi and his personal assistant [[Mahadev Desai]] at Birla House, 1939]]
During the discussions between Gandhi and the British government over 1931–32 at the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conferences]], Gandhi, now aged about 62, sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians.{{sfnp|Muldoon|2016|pp=92–99}} The British side sought reforms that would keep the Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. The British questioned the Congress party and Gandhi's authority to speak for all of India.{{sfnp|Gandhi|2008|pp=332–333}} They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as [[B. R. Ambedkar]] as the representative leader of the untouchables.{{sfnp|Muldoon|2016|pp=92–99}} Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status, and divert the attention from India's struggle to end the colonial rule.{{sfnp|Muldoon|2016|p=97}}{{sfnp|Brown|1991|pp=[https://archive.org/details/gandhi00judi/page/252 252–257]}}

The Second Round Table conference was the only time Gandhi left India between 1914 and his death in 1948. Gandhi declined the government's offer of accommodation in an expensive [[West End of London|West End]] hotel, preferring to stay in the [[East End of London|East End]], to live among working-class people, as he did in India.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mahatma Gandhi &#124; Philosopher & Teacher &#124; Blue Plaques |url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/mahatma-gandhi-kingsley-hall/ |access-date=26 September 2020 |website=English Heritage |archive-date=28 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928214656/https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/mahatma-gandhi-kingsley-hall/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Gandhi based himself in a small [[monastic cell|cell-bedroom]] at [[Kingsley Hall]] for the [[Kingsley Hall#Gandhi|three-month duration of his stay]] and was enthusiastically received by East Enders.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gandhi visits the poor people of England in 1931 – Gandhi Video Footage |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLYIEajnqnI |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002115124/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLYIEajnqnI&gl=US&hl=en |archive-date=2 October 2012 |access-date=26 September 2020 |website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> During this time, Gandhi renewed his links with the [[Vegetarianism by country#United Kingdom|British vegetarian movement]].

After Gandhi returned from the Second Round Table conference, he started a new ''satyagraha''. Gandhi was arrested and imprisoned at the [[Yerwada Jail]], Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. It came to be known as the [[Communal Award]].{{sfnp|Herman|2008|pp=382–390}} In protest, Gandhi started a fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison.<ref name="Dirks2011p267">{{Cite book |last=Nicholas B.

=== Congress politics ===
In 1934, Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership. He did not disagree with the party's position, but felt that if he resigned, Gandhi's popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.{{sfnp|Gandhi|1990|p=246}}

In 1936, Gandhi returned to active politics again with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow session of the Congress. Although Gandhi wanted a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about India's future, he did not restrain the Congress from adopting socialism as its goal. Gandhi had a clash with Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ghose |first=Sankar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzRuAAAAMAAJ |title=Jawaharlal Nehru, A Biography |publisher=Allied Publishers |year=1992 |isbn=8170233690 |page=137 |access-date=27 May 2023 |archive-date=27 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230527171235/https://books.google.com/books?id=mzRuAAAAMAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite Gandhi's opposition, Bose won a second term as Congress President, against Gandhi's nominee, [[Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya]].

[[File:Gandhi writing 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Gandhi in 1942, the year he launched the [[Quit India Movement]]]]

Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he was held in the [[Aga Khan Palace]] in [[Pune]]. During this period, Gandhi's longtime secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944, and Gandhi suffered a severe [[malaria]] attack.{{sfnp|Wolpert|2002a|pp=205–211}} While in jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.{{sfnp|Wolpert|2002a|pp=205–211}}

Gandhi was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 because of his failing health and necessary surgery; the Raj did not want him to die in prison and enrage the nation. Gandhi came out of detention to an altered political scene – the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] for example, which a few years earlier had appeared marginal, "now occupied the centre of the political stage"<ref name="Lapping1989" /> and the topic of Jinnah's campaign for Pakistan was a major talking point. Gandhi and Jinnah had extensive correspondence and the two men met several times over a period of two weeks in September 1944 at [[Jinnah Mansion|Jinnah's house]] in Bombay, where Gandhi insisted on a united religiously plural and independent India which included Muslims and non-Muslims of the Indian subcontinent coexisting. Jinnah rejected this proposal and insisted instead for partitioning the subcontinent on religious lines to create a separate Muslim homeland (later Pakistan).<ref name="Khan2007-page1">{{Cite book |last=Khan |first=Yasmin |year=2007 |url=https://archive.org/details/greatpartitionma00khan/page/18 |title=The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-12078-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatpartitionma00khan/page/18 18] |access-date=1 September 2013}} Quote: "the Muslim League had only caught on among South Asian Muslims during the Second World War. ...

Jinnah rejected Gandhi's proposal and called for [[Direct Action Day]], on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for the partition of the Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]] (excluding [[Cooch Behar district|Cooch Behar]]), gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the Direct Action Day.{{sfnp|Wolpert|2009|pp=118–121}} The Direct Action Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict.{{sfnp|Wolpert|2001a}} The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence.{{sfnp|Wolpert|2009|pp=118–121}} The violence on Direct Action Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India.

[[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the Viceroy and Governor-General of British India for three years through February 1947, had worked with Gandhi and Jinnah to find a common ground, before and after accepting Indian independence in principle. Wavell condemned Gandhi's character and motives as well as his ideas. Wavell accused Gandhi of harbouring the single-minded idea to "overthrow British rule and influence and to establish a Hindu raj", and called Gandhi a "malignant, malevolent, exceedingly shrewd" politician.{{sfnp|Dalton|2012a|pp=64–66}} Wavell feared a civil war on the Indian subcontinent, and doubted Gandhi would be able to stop it.{{sfnp|Dalton|2012a|pp=64–66}}

The British reluctantly agreed to grant independence to the people of the Indian subcontinent, but accepted Jinnah's proposal of partitioning the land into Pakistan and India. Gandhi was involved in the final negotiations, but [[Stanley Wolpert]] states the "plan to carve up British India was never approved of or accepted by Gandhi".{{sfnp|Wolpert|2002|p=7}}

The partition was controversial and violently disputed. More than half a million were killed in religious riots as 10&nbsp;million to 12&nbsp;million non-Muslims (Hindus and Sikhs mostly) migrated from Pakistan into India, and Muslims migrated from India into Pakistan, across the newly created borders of India, West Pakistan and East Pakistan.<ref name="MetcalfMetcalf2006">{{Cite book |last1=Metcalf |first1=Barbara Daly |title=A concise history of modern India |last2=Metcalf |first2=Thomas R. |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-521-86362-9 |pages=221–22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuESgYNYPl0C |access-date=29 March 2024 |archive-date=2 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230702122602/https://books.google.com/books?id=iuESgYNYPl0C |url-status=live }}</ref>

Gandhi spent the day of independence not celebrating the end of the British rule, but appealing for peace among his countrymen by fasting and spinning in Calcutta on 15 August 1947.

== Principles, practices, and beliefs ==
{{main|Practices and beliefs of Mahatma Gandhi}}
{{see also|Gandhism}}

Gandhi's spirituality was greatly based on his embracement of the five great vows of Jainism and Hindu Yoga philosophy, viz. ''Satya'' (truth), ''ahimsa'' (nonviolence), ''brahmacharya'' (celibacy), ''asteya'' (non-stealing), and ''aparigraha'' (non-attachment).<ref name="Marbaniang">{{cite book |last1=Marbaniang |first1=Domenic |chapter=Gandhian Pluralist Spirituality and the Anticorruption Mission of the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi |title=Asian Spiritualities and Social Transformation |date=2023 |pages=247–261 |doi=10.1007/978-981-99-2641-1_14 |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-2641-1_14 |publisher=Springer Nature |isbn=978-981-99-2641-1 |language=en |access-date=10 August 2024 |archive-date=10 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240810010402/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-2641-1_14 |url-status=live }}</ref> He stated that "Unless you impose on yourselves the five vows you may not embark on the experiment at all."<ref name="Marbaniang"/> Gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him. Some writers present Gandhi as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.{{sfnp|Borman|1986|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=U6DE9OUvrTEC&pg=PA192 192]–195, 208–229}}<ref>{{harvp|Dalton|2012|pp=30–35}}. "Yet he [Gandhi] must bear some of the responsibility for losing his followers along the way. The sheer vagueness and contradictions recurrent throughout his writing made it easier to accept him as a saint than to fathom the challenge posed by his demanding beliefs. Gandhi saw no harm in self-contradictions: life was a series of experiments, and any principle might change if Truth so dictated."</ref>

=== Truth and Satyagraha ===
[[File:Mahatma Gandhi on Rumours.jpg|thumb|Plaque displaying one of Gandhi's quotes on rumour]]
Gandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth, or ''[[Satya]]'', and called his movement [[satyagraha]], which means "appeal to, insistence on, or reliance on the Truth."<ref>{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=Gene |url=https://archive.org/details/gandhiwieldsweap00shar |title=Gandhi Wields the Weapon of Moral Power: Three Case Histories |publisher=Navajivan |year=1960 |page=[https://archive.org/details/gandhiwieldsweap00shar/page/4 4]}}</ref> The first formulation of the ''satyagraha'' as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920, which Gandhi tabled as "Resolution on Non-cooperation" in September that year before a session of the Indian Congress. It was the ''satyagraha'' formulation and step, states Dennis Dalton, that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people, embedded him into the popular consciousness, transforming him quickly into Mahatma.{{sfnp|Dalton|2012|pp=30–32}}

[[File:God is Truth.jpg|thumb|left|"God is truth. The way to truth lies through [[ahimsa]] (nonviolence)" – [[Sabarmati Ashram|Sabarmati]], 13 March 1927]]

Gandhi based ''Satyagraha'' on the Vedantic ideal of self-realisation, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and universal love. William Borman states that the key to his ''satyagraha'' is rooted in the Hindu [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] texts.{{sfnp|Borman|1986|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=U6DE9OUvrTEC&pg=PA26 26]–34}} According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ''ahimsa'' and ''satyagraha'' were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Indira Carr |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZQqBgAAQBAJ |title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers |publisher=Routledge |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-134-92796-8 |editor-last=Stuart Brown |page=264 |display-editors=etal}}</ref> I.

Gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities. Gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said, "God is Truth." Gandhi would later change this statement to "Truth is God." Thus, ''satya'' (truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is "God".<ref name="Parel2006">{{cite book |last=Parel, Anthony |title=Gandhi's Philosophy and the Quest for Harmony |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-521-86715-3 |page=195 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQhz0fW0HZUC&pg=PA195 |access-date=13 January 2012 |archive-date=21 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230721073617/https://books.google.com/books?id=MQhz0fW0HZUC&pg=PA195 |url-status=live }}</ref> Gandhi, states Richards, described the term "God" not as a separate power, but as the Being (Brahman, Atman) of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] tradition, a nondual universal that pervades in all things, in each person and all life.<ref name="richards1" /> According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant the unity of God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that ''atman'' exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this ''atman''.<ref name=gier40>{{cite book|author=Nicholas F.

The essence of [[Satyagraha]] is "soul force" as a political means, refusing to use brute force against the oppressor, seeking to eliminate antagonisms between the oppressor and the oppressed, aiming to transform or "purify" the oppressor. It is not inaction but determined passive resistance and non-co-operation where, states Arthur Herman, "love conquers hate".{{sfnp|Herman|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C&pg=PA176 176]}} A euphemism sometimes used for Satyagraha is that it is a "silent force" or a "soul force" (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a "universal force", as it essentially "makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe."{{efn|name="rules"|<ref>{{cite book |last=Gandhi |first=M.K. |contribution=Some Rules of Satyagraha ''Young India (Navajivan)'' 23 February 1930 |title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi |volume=48 |page=340}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Misra |first=Bijoy |date=18 October 2017 |title=Mahatma Gandhi's Rules for Satyagraha |website=www.lokvani.com |url=https://www.lokvani.com/lokvani/article.php?article_id=13907 |access-date=5 July 2024 |archive-date=30 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230730054534/https://www.lokvani.com/lokvani/article.php?article_id=13907 |url-status=live }} (Young India, 27 February 1930, The Gujarati original of this appeared in Navajivan, 23 February 1930)</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Yadav |first=Yogendra |date=9 January 2013 |title=Some Rules of Satyagraha |website=The Gandhi-King Community |url=https://gandhiking.ning.com/profiles/blogs/some-rules-of-satyagraha-1 |access-date=5 July 2024 |archive-date=11 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240811213050/https://gandhiking.ning.com/profiles/blogs/some-rules-of-satyagraha-1 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

While Gandhi's idea of ''satyagraha'' as a political means attracted a widespread following among Indians, the support was not universal. For example, Muslim leaders such as Jinnah opposed the ''satyagraha'' idea, accused Gandhi to be reviving Hinduism through political activism, and began effort to counter Gandhi with Muslim nationalism and a demand for Muslim homeland.<ref>{{cite book|author=R.

In his early years, the former [[President of South Africa]] Nelson Mandela was a follower of the nonviolent resistance philosophy of Gandhi.<ref name="Mandela-2000" /> Bhana and Vahed commented on these events as "Gandhi inspired succeeding generations of South African activists seeking to end White rule. This legacy connects him to Nelson Mandela...in a sense, Mandela completed what Gandhi started."<ref name="BhanaVahed2005" />

Gandhi's life and teachings inspired many who specifically referred to Gandhi as their mentor or who dedicated their lives to spreading his ideas. In Europe, [[Romain Rolland]] was the first to discuss Gandhi in his 1924 book ''Mahatma Gandhi'', and Brazilian anarchist and feminist [[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] wrote about Gandhi in her work on pacifism. In 1931, physicist [[Albert Einstein]] exchanged letters with Gandhi and called him "a role model for the generations to come" in a letter writing about him.<ref name="Albano-Müller">{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhiserve.org/streams/einstein.html |title=Einstein on Gandhi (Einstein's letter to Gandhi – Courtesy:Saraswati Albano-Müller & Notes by Einstein on Gandhi – Source: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem) |publisher=Gandhiserve.org |date=18 October 1931 |access-date=24 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117104005/http://www.gandhiserve.org/streams/einstein.html |archive-date=17 January 2012 }}</ref> Einstein said of Gandhi:

<blockquote>Mahatma Gandhi's life achievement stands unique in political history. He has invented a completely new and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only be the work of such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.

Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood.</blockquote>
