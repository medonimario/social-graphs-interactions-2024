{{Original research|discuss=Original research|date=June 2021}}

===''Performative Acts and Gender Constitution'' (1988)===
In the essay "Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory," Judith Butler proposes that [[gender performativity|gender is performative]] – that is, gender is not so much a static identity or role, but rather comprises a set of acts which can evolve over time.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Butler |first=Judith |date=December 1988 |title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3207893 |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=519–520 |doi=10.2307/3207893 |jstor=3207893 }}</ref> Butler states that because gender identity is established through behavior, there is a possibility to construct different genders via different behaviors.<ref name="Jones2018">{{cite web | url = https://www.openculture.com/2018/02/judith-butler-on-gender-performativity.html | first = Josh | last = Jones | date = 7 February 2018 | title = Theorist Judith Butler Explains How Behavior Creates Gender: A Short Introduction to "Gender Performativity" | website = Open Culture | access-date = 8 July 2021}}</ref> <blockquote>"...if gender is instituted through acts which are internally discontinuous, then the appearance of substance is precisely that, a constructed identity, a performative accomplishment which the mundane social audience, including the actors themselves, come to believe and to perform in the mode of belief. If the ground of gender identity is the stylized repetition of acts through time, and not a seemingly seamless identity, then the possibilities of gender transformation are to be found in the arbitrary relation between such acts, in the possibility of a different sort of repeating, in the breaking or subversive repetition of that style."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory |date=December 1988 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1988 |pages=520 |language=en}}</ref></blockquote>Butler concludes their essay with a personal reflection on the strengths and limitations of widespread feminist theories which function on a solely binary perception of gender. Butler critiques what they call the "reification" of sexual difference within a heterosexual framework, and articulates their concern with how this framework affects the accurate presentation (or lack thereof) of "femaleness" across a diverse array of experiences, including those of women.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Butler |first=Judith |date=December 1988 |title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3207893 |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=530 |doi=10.2307/3207893 |jstor=3207893 }}</ref><blockquote>"As a corporeal field of cultural play, gender is a basically innovative affair, although it is quite clear that there are strict punishments for contesting the script by performing out of turn or through unwarranted improvisations. Gender is not passively scripted on the body, and neither is it determined by nature, language, the symbolic, or the overwhelming history of patriarchy. Gender is what is put on, invariably, under constraint, daily and incessantly, with anxiety and pleasure, but if this continuous act is mistaken for a natural or linguistic given, power is relinquished to expand the cultural field bodily through subversive performances of various kinds."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Butler |first=Judith |date=December 1988 |title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3207893 |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=531 |doi=10.2307/3207893 |jstor=3207893 }}</ref></blockquote>Throughout this text, Butler derives influence from French philosophers such as [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], particularly de Beauvoir's ''[[The Second Sex]]'' and Merleau-Ponty's "The Body in its Sexual Being." Butler also cites works by [[Gayle Rubin]], [[Mary Anne Warren]], and their own piece "Sex and Gender in Simone de Beauvoir's ''Second Sex''" (1986), among others.

Butler offers a critique of the terms ''gender'' and ''sex'' as they have been used by feminists.<ref>{{cite book|title=Judith Butler| chapter=A Dictionary of Critical Theory |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t306.e100&srn=1&ssid=460269119#FIRSTHIT|publisher=Oxford reference Online Premium|isbn=978-0-19-953291-9|date=January 2010|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199532919.001.0001}}</ref> Butler argues that feminism made a mistake in trying to make "women" a discrete, ahistorical group with common characteristics. Butler writes that this approach reinforces the binary view of gender relations. Butler believes that feminists should not try to define "women" and they also believe that feminists should "focus on providing an account of how power functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also within the feminist movement."<ref>{{cite book|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2017}}</ref> Finally, Butler aims to break the supposed links between sex and gender so that gender and desire can be "flexible, free floating and not caused by other stable factors" (David Gauntlett).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Butler |first=Paul |date=2004 |title=Embracing AIDS: History, Identity, and Post-AIDS Discourse |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20866614 |journal=JAC |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=102 |jstor=20866614 }}</ref> The idea of identity as free and flexible and gender as performative, not an essence, has become one of the foundations of [[queer theory]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=He |first=Li |date=2017 |title=The Construction of Gender: Judith Butler and Gender Performativity |url=https://www.atlantis-press.com/article/25878697.pdf |journal=Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research |volume=124 |pages=4 |via=Atlantis Press}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Browne |first=Evie |date=2019 |title=ALIGN Guide: Gender norms, LGBTQI issues and development |url=https://www.alignplatform.org/2-queer-theory-and-gender-norms |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240229031241/https://www.alignplatform.org/2-queer-theory-and-gender-norms#js-page |archive-date=February 29, 2024 |access-date=February 28, 2024 |website=Advancing Learning and Innovation on Gender Norms (ALIGN) |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref>

===''Imitation and Gender Insubordination'' (1991)===
''Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories'' is a collection of writings of gay and lesbian social theorists. Butler's contribution argues that no transparent revelation is afforded by using the terms "gay" or "lesbian" yet there is a political imperative to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Imitation and Gender Insubordination|url=http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/gustafson/FILM%20165A.W11/film%20165A%5BW11%5D%20readings%20/Judith_Butler__Imitation_and_Gender_Insubordination.pdf|access-date=November 29, 2021|archive-date=April 1, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220401031510/http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/gustafson/FILM%20165A.W11/film%20165A%5BW11%5D%20readings%20/Judith_Butler__Imitation_and_Gender_Insubordination.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> Butler employs "the concepts of play/performance, drag, and imitation" to describe the formation of gender and sexuality as continually created subjectivities always at risk of dissolution from non-performance."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ellis|first=Jason W.|date=2014-04-14|title=Recovered Writing, PhD in English, Queer Studies, Presentation on Judith Butler's "Imitation and Gender Insubordination" and Introduction to Bodies That Matter Feb. 6, 2008|url=https://dynamicsubspace.net/2014/04/14/recovered-writing-phd-in-english-queer-studies-presentation-on-judith-butlers-imitation-and-gender-insubordination-and-introduction-to-bodies-that-matter-feb-6-2008/|access-date=2021-11-29|website=Dynamic Subspace|language=en}}</ref>

===''Bodies That Matter'' (1993)===
''Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex'' seeks to clear up readings and supposed misinterpretations of performativity that view the enactment of sex/gender as a daily choice.<ref>For example, {{Cite journal | last=Jeffreys | first=Sheila | author-link=Sheila Jeffreys | title = The queer disappearance of lesbians: Sexuality in the academy | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 459–472 | doi = 10.1016/0277-5395(94)00051-4 | date = September–October 1994 }}</ref> As such, Butler aims to answer questions of this vein that may have been raised from their previous work ''Gender Trouble''. Butler emphasizes the role of repetition in performativity, making use of [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]'s theory of iterability, which is a form of [[citationality]]:<blockquote>Performativity cannot be understood outside of a process of iterability, a regularized and constrained repetition of norms. And this repetition is not performed ''by'' a subject; this repetition is what enables a subject and constitutes the temporal condition for the subject. This iterability implies that 'performance' is not a singular 'act' or event, but a ritualized production, a ritual reiterated under and through constraint, under and through the force of prohibition and taboo, with the threat of ostracism and even death controlling and compelling the shape of the production, but not, I will insist, determining it fully in advance.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |url=https://archive.org/details/bodiesthatmatter00butl |title=Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of "Sex" |publisher=Routledge |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-415-90365-3 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/bodiesthatmatter00butl/page/95 95] |author-link=Judith Butler |url-access=registration}}</ref></blockquote>Butler also explores how gender can be understood not only as a performance, but also as a "constitutive constraint," or constructed character. They ask how this conceptualization of an individual's gender contributes to notions of bodily intelligibility, or comprehension, by other individuals. Butler continues to discuss bodily intelligibility by means of sex as a "materialized" entity, upon which cultural, collective ideals of gender can be built. From this angle, Butler interrogates value conscription upon various bodies as determined theories and practices of heterosexual predominance.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |title=Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex |date=1993 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415610155 |edition=1st |location=New York, NY |publication-date=May 13, 2011 |pages=x-xii |language=en}}</ref> <blockquote>If gender consists of the social meanings that sex assumes, then sex does not accrue social meanings as additive properties but, rather, is replaced by the social meanings it takes on; sex is relinquished in the course of that assumption, and gender emerges, not as a term in a continued relationship of opposition to sex, but as the term which absorbs and displaces "sex," the mark of its full substantiation into gender or what, from a materialist point of view, might constitute a full de-substantiation.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |title=Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex |date=1993 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415610155 |edition=1st |location=New York, NY |publication-date=May 13, 2011 |pages=5 |language=en}}</ref></blockquote>While continuing to draw upon sources such as those of [[Plato]], [[Luce Irigaray|Irigaray]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] (as they did for ''Gender Trouble''), Butler also draws upon pieces of documentary film and literature for ''Bodies That Matter''.

===''Excitable Speech'' (1997)===
{{further|Performativity#Judith Butler}}

In ''Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative'', Butler surveys the problems of [[hate speech]] and censorship. They argue that censorship is difficult to evaluate, and that in some cases it may be useful or even necessary, while in others it may be worse than tolerance.<ref name="Jagger">{{cite book |last=Jagger|first=Gill |title=Judith Butler: Sexual politics, social change and the power of the performative |url=https://archive.org/details/judithbutlersexu00jagg|url-access=limited|year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=[https://archive.org/details/judithbutlersexu00jagg/page/n121 115]–8 |isbn=978-0-415-21975-4 |ol=OL10187608M |lccn=2007032458}}</ref>

Butler argues that hate speech exists retrospectively, only after being declared such by state authorities. In this way, the state reserves for itself the power to define hate speech and, conversely, the limits of acceptable discourse. In this connection, Butler criticizes feminist legal scholar [[Catharine MacKinnon]]'s argument against pornography for its unquestioning acceptance of the state's power to censor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=978-0-415-91588-5|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/excitablespeechp0000butl/page/22 22]|quote="Similarly, MacKinnon's appeal to the state to construe pornography as performative speech and, hence, as the injurious conduct of representation, does not settle the theoretical question of the relation between representation and conduct, but collapses the distinction in order to enhance the power of state intervention over graphic sexual representation."|url=https://archive.org/details/excitablespeechp0000butl/page/22}}</ref>

Deploying [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s argument from the first volume of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', Butler states that any attempt at censorship, legal or otherwise, necessarily propagates the very language it seeks to forbid.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |author-link=Judith Butler |title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative |url=https://archive.org/details/excitablespeechp0000butl |url-access=registration |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=[https://archive.org/details/excitablespeechp0000butl/page/129 129–33] |isbn=978-0-415-91588-5}}</ref> As Foucault argues, for example, the strict sexual mores of 19th-century Western Europe did nothing but amplify the discourse of sexuality they sought to control.<ref>For example, {{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |author-link=Michel Foucault |others=Trans.

In this way, Butler questions the possibility of any genuinely oppositional discourse; "If speech depends upon censorship, then the principle that one might seek to oppose is at once the formative principle of oppositional speech".<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |author-link=Judith Butler |title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative |url=https://archive.org/details/excitablespeechp0000butl |url-access=registration |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | page=[https://archive.org/details/excitablespeechp0000butl/page/140 140] |isbn=978-0-415-91588-5}}</ref>

The "[[state of exception]]" deployed here is in fact more complex than the one pointed out by [[Giorgio Agamben|Agamben]] in his ''Homo Sacer'', since the government is in a more ambiguous relation to law —it may comply with it or suspend it, depending on its interests, and this is itself a tool of the state to produce its own sovereignty.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Judith |title=Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence |date=2004 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn= 978-1-84467-544-9 |language=en|pages=55, 61–62, 66, 83}}</ref> Butler also points towards problems in [[international law]] treatises like the [[Geneva Conventions]]. In practice, these only protect people who belong to (or act in the name of) a recognized state, and therefore are helpless in situations of abuse toward [[Statelessness|stateless people]], people who do not enjoy a recognized citizenship or people who are labelled "terrorists", and therefore understood as acting on their own behalf as irrational "killing machines" that need to be held captive due to their "dangerousness".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Judith |title=Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence |date=2004 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn= 978-1-84467-544-9 |language=en|pages=86–87, 73–74, 76}}</ref>

Butler also writes here on vulnerability and precariousness as intrinsic to the human condition. This is due to our inevitable interdependency from other precarious subjects, who are never really "complete" or autonomous but instead always "dispossessed" on the Other. This is manifested in shared experiences like [[grief]] and loss, that can form the basis for a recognition of our shared human (vulnerable) condition.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Judith |title=Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence |date=2004 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn= 978-1-84467-544-9 |language=en|pages=20}}</ref> However, not every loss can be mourned in the same way, and in fact not every life can be conceived of as such (as situated in a condition common to ours).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Judith |title=Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence |date=2004 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn= 978-1-84467-544-9 |language=en|pages=32–33}}</ref> Through a critical engagement with [[Emmanuel Levinas|Levinas]], they will explore how certain representations prevent lives from being considered worthy of being lived or taken into account, precluding the mourning of certain Others, and with that the recognition of them and their losses as equally human.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Judith |title=Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence |date=2004 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn= 978-1-84467-544-9 |language=en|pages=147}}</ref> This preoccupation with the dignifying or dehumanizing role of practices of framing and representations will constitute one of the central elements of ''Frames of War'' (2009).

===''Undoing Gender'' (2004)===
{{Main|Undoing Gender}}
''Undoing Gender'' collects Butler's reflections on gender, sex, sexuality, psychoanalysis and the medical treatment of intersex people for a more general readership than many of their other books. Butler revisits and refines their notion of performativity and focuses on the question of undoing "restrictively normative conceptions of sexual and gendered life".{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

Butler discusses how gender is performed without one being conscious of it, but says that it does not mean this performativity is "automatic or mechanical". They argue that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The writer also debates our notions of "human" and "less-than-human" and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a "viable life" as the biggest concerns are usually about whether a person will be accepted if their desires differ from normality. Butler states that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life "unlivable". The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.<ref>Butler, Judith (2004). Undoing Gender. New York: Routledge</ref>

In Butler's discussion of intersex issues and people, Butler addresses the case of [[David Reimer]], a person whose sex was medically [[Sex assignment#Assignment in cases of infants with intersex traits, or cases of trauma|reassigned]] from male to female after a botched [[circumcision]] at eight months of age. Reimer was "made" female by doctors, but later in life identified as "really" male, married and became a stepfather to his wife's three children, and went on to tell his story in ''[[As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl]]'', which he wrote with [[John Colapinto]]. Reimer died by suicide in 2004.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://slate.com/id/2101678/ | title = Gender Gap: What were the real reasons behind David Reimer's suicide? | last = Colapinto | first = J | author-link = John Colapinto | magazine = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date = June 3, 2004 | access-date = February 13, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110916170908/http://www.slate.com/id/2101678/ | archive-date = September 16, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

===''Giving an Account of Oneself'' (2005)===
In ''Giving an Account of Oneself'', Butler develops an ethics based on the opacity of the subject to itself; in other words, the limits of self-knowledge. Primarily borrowing from [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jean Laplanche]], [[Adriana Cavarero]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], Butler develops a theory of the formation of the subject. Butler theorizes the subject in relation to the social&nbsp;– a community of others and their norms – which is beyond the control of the subject it forms, as precisely the very condition of that subject's formation, the resources by which the subject becomes recognizably human, a grammatical "I", in the first place.

Butler accepts the claim that if the subject is opaque to itself the limitations of its free ethical responsibility and obligations are due to the limits of narrative, presuppositions of language and projection.

{{blockquote|You may think that I am in fact telling a story about the prehistory of the subject, one that I have been arguing cannot be told. There are two responses to this objection. (1) That there is no final or adequate narrative reconstruction of the prehistory of the speaking "I" does not mean we cannot narrate it; it only means that at the moment when we narrate we become speculative philosophers or fiction writers. (2) This prehistory has never stopped happening and, as such, is not a prehistory in any chronological sense. It is not done with, over, relegated to a past, which then becomes part of a causal or narrative reconstruction of the self. On the contrary, that prehistory interrupts the story I have to give of myself, makes every account of myself partial and failed, and constitutes, in a way, my failure to be fully accountable for my actions, my final "irresponsibility," one for which I may be forgiven only because I could not do otherwise. This not being able to do otherwise is our common predicament (page 78).}}

Instead Butler argues for an ethics based precisely on the limits of self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks the constitution of the self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human in the first place and which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Judith|s2cid=143558617|date=2001|title=Giving an Account of Oneself|journal=Diacritics|volume=31|issue=4|pages=22–40|jstor=1566427|doi=10.1353/dia.2004.0002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Butler, Judith|title=Giving an account of oneself|date=2005|publisher=Fordham University Press|isbn=978-0-8232-3523-0|edition=1st|location=New York|lccn=2005017141|oclc=191818345|ol=OL23241953M}}</ref>

In ''The Force of Nonviolence: An Ethico-Political Bind'', Butler connects the ideologies of nonviolence and the political struggle for social equality.

More recently, several critics — such as semiotician [[Viviane Namaste]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Namaste|first1=Viviane|title=Undoing Theory: The "Transgender Question" and the Epistemic Violence of Anglo-American Feminist Theory|journal=Hypatia|volume=24|issue=3|year=2009|pages=11–32|issn=0887-5367|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2009.01043.x|s2cid=145627130}}</ref>
— have criticised Judith Butler's ''Undoing Gender'' for under-emphasizing the intersectional aspects of gender-based violence. For example, Timothy Laurie notes that Butler's use of phrases like "gender politics" and "gender violence" in relation to assaults on transgender individuals in the United States can "[scour] a landscape filled with class and labour relations, racialized urban stratification, and complex interactions between sexual identity, sexual practices and sex work", and produce instead "a clean surface on which struggles over 'the human' are imagined to play out".<ref>{{Citation | title= The Ethics of Nobody I Know: Gender and the Politics of Description | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Qualitative Research Journal | volume= 14 | issue= 1 | page= 72 | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/6262250| doi= 10.1108/QRJ-03-2014-0011 | hdl= 10453/44221 | hdl-access= free }}</ref>

German feminist [[Alice Schwarzer]] speaks of Butler's "radical intellectual games" that would not change how society classifies and treats a woman; thus, by eliminating female and male identity Butler would have abolished the discourse about sexism in the queer community. Schwarzer also accuses Butler of remaining silent about the oppression of women and homosexuals in the Islamic world, while readily exercising their right to [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex-marriage]] in the United States; instead, Butler would sweepingly defend [[Islam]], including [[Islamism]], from critics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emma.de/artikel/eine-antwort-auf-butler-334719|title=Weiberzank – oder Polit-Kontroverse?|last=Alice Schwarzer schreibt|date=29 August 2017|website=Emma|language=de|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref>

==Political activism==
Much of Butler's early political activism centered around queer and feminist issues, and they served, for a period of time, as the chair of the board of the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://outrightinternational.org/content/outright-now-reunion-2018|title=OutRight Now: Reunion 2018|last=Jessica Stern|date=2018-07-23|website=Global LGBT Human Rights Organization {{!}} OutRight|language=en|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref> Over the years, Butler has been particularly active in the gay and lesbian rights, feminist, and anti-war movements.<ref name="mcgill" /> They have also written and spoken out on issues ranging from affirmative action and gay marriage to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the prisoners detained at Guantanamo Bay. More recently, Butler has been active in the [[Occupy movement]] and has publicly expressed support for a version of the 2005 BDS ([[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]]) campaign against Israel.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

Butler argues that, although [[antisemitism]] has been rising, there is a danger that Jews are seen as "presumptive victims", leading to widespread [[Weaponization of antisemitism|misuse of accusations of antisemitism]], which may in fact trivialize the accusation's gravity and weight.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Judith |contribution = The Charge of Anti-Semitism: Jews, Israel, and the risks of public critique |title=Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence |date=2004 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn= 978-1-84467-544-9 |language=en|pages=101–128}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Butler |first1=Judith |title=No, it's not anti-semitic: the right to criticise Israel |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |date=2003 |volume=25 |issue=16 |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v25/n16/judith-butler/no-it-s-not-anti-semitic |access-date=9 May 2022}}</ref>

On September 7, 2006, Butler participated in a faculty-organized [[teach-in]] against the [[2006 Lebanon War]] at the University of California, Berkeley.<ref>{{cite web| title=Coming attractions for fall 2006| url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/09/06_eventspreview2.shtml|publisher=UC Berkeley| access-date=6 September 2015}}</ref> Another widely publicized moment occurred in June 2010, when Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the [[Christopher Street Day]] (CSD) Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony. They cited racist comments on the part of organizers and a general failure of CSD organizations to distance themselves from racism in general and from anti-Muslim excuses for war more specifically. Criticizing the event's commercialism, Butler went on to name several groups that they commended as stronger opponents of "homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, and militarism".<ref>Butler, Judith.

In October 2011, Butler attended [[Occupy Wall Street]] and, in reference to calls for clarification of the protesters' demands, they said:

<blockquote>People have asked, so what are the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social equality and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible&nbsp;– that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/10/24/judith_butler_at_occupy_wall_street/|title=Judith Butler at Occupy Wall Street|date=October 24, 2011|website=Salon.com|access-date=December 4, 2017|author=Justin Elliott}}</ref>

When Butler received the 2012 [[Theodor W.

In a letter to the ''[[Mondoweiss]]'' website, Butler wrote that they developed strong ethical views on the basis of Jewish philosophical thought and that it is "blatantly untrue, absurd, and painful for anyone to argue that those who formulate a criticism of the State of Israel is anti-Semitic or, if Jewish, self-hating".<ref name=mondoweiss>{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Judith Butler responds to attack: 'I affirm a Judaism that is not associated with state violence'|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2012/08/judith-butler-responds-to-attack-i-affirm-a-judaism-that-is-not-associated-with-state-violence.html|publisher=Mondoweiss|access-date=9 October 2013|date=27 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228153648/http://mondoweiss.net/2012/08/judith-butler-responds-to-attack-i-affirm-a-judaism-that-is-not-associated-with-state-violence.html|archive-date=December 28, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Comments on Hamas, Hezbollah and the Israel–Hamas war ===
Butler was criticized for statements they had made about [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]]. Butler was accused of describing them as "social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left."<ref>Petra Marquardt-Bigman, [http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/09/07/defending-judith-butler-in-the-ivory-tower/ "Defending Judith Butler in The Ivory Tower"], ''The Algemeiner Journal'', September 7, 2012.</ref> They were accused of defending "Hezbollah and Hamas as progressive organizations" and supporting their tactics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weinthal|first=Benjamin|title=Frankfurt to award US advocate of Israel boycott|journal=The Jerusalem Post|date=26 August 2012|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Frankfurt-to-award-US-advocate-of-Israel-boycott|access-date=9 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Illouz|first=Eva|title=Judith Butler gets a taste of her own politics|journal=Haaretz|date=20 September 2012|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/judith-butler-gets-a-taste-of-her-own-politics-1.465861|access-date=9 October 2013}}</ref>

Butler responded to these criticisms by stating that their remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah were taken completely out of context and, in so doing, their established views on non-violence were contradicted and misrepresented. Butler describes the origin of their remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah in the following way:
<blockquote>I was asked by a member of an academic audience a few years ago whether I thought Hamas and Hezbollah belonged to "the global left" and I replied with two points. My first point was merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left. My second point was then critical: as with any group on the left, one has to decide whether one is for that group or against that group, and one needs to critically evaluate their stand.<ref name="mondoweiss" /></blockquote>

After the start of the 2023 [[Israel–Hamas war]], Butler published an essay titled "The Compass of Mourning", in which they "condemn without qualification" the "terrifying and revolting massacre" while at the same time argued that Hamas' attacks should be seen in the context of the "horrors of the last seventy years".<ref>Butler, Judith: [https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v45/n20/judith-butler/the-compass-of-mourning''The Compass of Mourning''], lrb.co.uk, October 19, 2023.</ref> The article was criticized several times in German newspapers. Christian Geyer-Hindemith wrote in the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' that Butler "makes individual atrocities disappear" through contextualization. Thomas E. Schmidt spoke in the ''[[Die Zeit]]'' about "reversal of guilt", while Anna Mayr wrote in the ''Die Zeit'' that "countless the same thing goes on for paragraphs: Nothing can justify the violence, and you still have to see the violence of the occupying power, Israel.

=== Comments on Black Lives Matter ===
In a January 2015 interview with [[George Yancy]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', Butler discussed the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement. They said:
<blockquote>What is implied by this statement [Black Lives Matter], a statement that should be obviously true, but apparently is not? If black lives do not matter, then they are not really regarded as lives, since a life is supposed to matter. So what we see is that some lives matter more than others, that some lives matter so much that they need to be protected at all costs, and that other lives matter less, or not at all. And when that becomes the situation, then the lives that do not matter so much, or do not matter at all, can be killed or lost, can be exposed to conditions of destitution, and there is no concern, or even worse, that is regarded as the way it is supposed to be...When people engage in concerted actions across racial lines to build communities based on equality, to defend the rights of those who are disproportionately imperiled to have a chance to live without the fear of dying quite suddenly at the hands of the police. There are many ways to do this, in the street, the office, the home, and in the media. Only through such an ever-growing cross-racial struggle against racism can we begin to achieve a sense of all the lives that really do matter.</blockquote>
The dialogue draws heavily on their 2004 book ''Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence.''<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yancy|first1=George|last2=Butler|first2=Judith|title=What's Wrong With 'All Lives Matter'?|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/whats-wrong-with-all-lives-matter/?_r=0|access-date=7 March 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 January 2015}}</ref>

===Avital Ronell sexual harassment case===
On May 11, 2018, Butler joined a group of scholars in writing a letter to [[New York University]] following the sexual harassment suit filed by a former NYU graduate student against his advisor [[Avital Ronell]]. The signatories acknowledged not having had access to the confidential findings of the investigation that followed the [[Title IX]] complaint against Ronell. Nonetheless, they accused the complainant of waging a "malicious campaign" against Ronell. The signatories also wrote that the presumed "malicious intention has animated and sustained this legal nightmare" for a highly regarded scholar. "If she were to be terminated or relieved of her duties, the injustice would be widely recognized and opposed."<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Battle-Over-Alleged-Harassment/244295|title=Battle Over Alleged Harassment Escalates as Former Graduate Student Sues Professor and NYU|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=August 16, 2018|last1=Mangan|first1=Katherine}}</ref> Butler, one of the signatories, invoked their title as President Elect of the [[Modern Language Association]]. James J. Marino, a professor at Cleveland State University and a member of the MLA, started a petition to demand Butler's resignation or removal from their post.

Butler said in 2020 that [[trans-exclusionary radical feminism]] (TERF) is "a fringe movement that is seeking to speak in the name of the mainstream, and that our responsibility is to refuse to let that happen".<ref>{{cite news |title=Judith Butler on the culture wars, JK Rowling and living in "anti-intellectual times" |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2020/09/judith-butler-culture-wars-jk-rowling-and-living-anti-intellectual-times |access-date=17 November 2021 |work=New Statesman}}</ref> In 2021, drawing from [[Umberto Eco]] who understood "fascism" as "a beehive of contradictions",{{efn|Butler notes a 'contradiction': {{blockquote|... chromosomal and endocrinological differences complicate the binarism [''[[sic]]''] of sex ...

''The Guardian'' was then accused of censoring Judith Butler for having compared TERFs to fascists. British writer [[Roz Kaveney]] called it "a truly shocking moment of bigoted dishonesty", while British transgender activist and writer [[Juno Dawson]], among others, observed that ''The Guardian'' had inadvertently triggered the [[Streisand effect]], in which an attempt to censor yields the unintended consequence of increasing awareness of a topic.<ref name="Guardian accused of censoring">{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/09/08/judith-butler-guardian-interview-terf-trans/ |title=The Guardian accused of 'censoring' Judith Butler interview comparing TERFs to fascists: 'Cowards' |work=[[PinkNews]] |date=September 8, 2021 |accessdate=September 8, 2021 |author=Wakefield, Lily}}</ref> The next day, ''The Guardian'' acknowledged "a failure in our editorial standards".<ref name="Guardian censored"/>
