'''Gian-Carlo Rota''' (April 27, 1932 &ndash; April 18, 1999) was an Italian-American [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]]. He spent most of his career at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he worked in [[combinatorics]], [[functional analysis]], [[probability theory]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

==Early life and education==
Rota was born in [[Vigevano]], [[Italy]]. His father, Giovanni, an architect and prominent [[antifascist]], was the brother of the mathematician Rosetta, who was the wife of the writer [[Ennio Flaiano]].<ref name="MacTutor">{{MacTutor Biography|id=Rota}}</ref><ref name="palombi">{{cite book | title = The Star and the Whole: Gian-Carlo Rota on Mathematics and Phenomenology | url = https://archive.org/details/starwholegiancar00palo | url-access = limited | last1 = Palombi  |first1 = Fabrizio | pages = [https://archive.org/details/starwholegiancar00palo/page/n15 6]–7 | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781568815831 | quote = His aunt, Rosetta Rota (1911–2003), was a mathematician associated with the renowned Rome university Institute of Physics in Via Panispenra… }}</ref>  Gian-Carlo's family left Italy when he was 13 years old, initially going to [[Switzerland]].

Rota attended the [[Colegio Americano de Quito]] in Ecuador, and graduated with an A.B. in mathematics from [[Princeton University]] in 1953 after completing a senior thesis, titled "On the solubility of linear equations in [[topological vector space]]s", under the supervision of [[William Feller]]. He then pursued graduate studies at [[Yale University]], where he received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics in 1956 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled "Extension Theory Of Ordinary Linear [[Differential operator|Differential Operators]]", under the supervision of [[Jacob T. Schwartz]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=American Mathematical Society {{!}} Gian-Carlo Rota (1932–1999)|url=https://www.ams.org/notices/200002/mem-rota.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite thesis|title=Extension Theory Of Ordinary Linear Differential Operators|url=https://orbis.library.yale.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=14963958|publisher=Yale University|date=1956|place=New Haven, Connecticut|first=Gian Carlo|last=Rota}}</ref>

==Career==
Much of Rota's career was spent as a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where he was and remains the only person ever to be appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics and Philosophy. Rota was also the [[Norbert Wiener]] Professor of Applied Mathematics.

In addition to his professorships at MIT, Rota held four honorary degrees, from the University of Strasbourg, France (1984); the [[University of L'Aquila]], Italy (1990); the [[University of Bologna]], Italy (1996); and [[Brooklyn Polytechnic|Brooklyn Polytechnic University]] (1997).
Beginning in 1966 he was a consultant at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], frequently visiting to lecture, discuss, and collaborate, notably with his friend [[Stanisław Ulam]]. He was also a consultant for the [[Rand Corporation]] (1966–71) and for the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (1969&ndash;1973). Rota was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1982, was vice president of the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) from 1995–97, and was a member of numerous other mathematical and philosophical organizations.<ref name="web.mit.edu">{{cite web | title=MIT professor Gian-Carlo Rota, mathematician and philosopher, is dead at 66 | website=MIT News | date=1999-04-22 | url=https://news.mit.edu/1999/rota | access-date=2024-01-31}}</ref>

He taught a difficult but very popular course in [[probability]]. He also taught Applications of Calculus, [[differential equations]], and [[Combinatorics|Combinatorial Theory]]. His philosophy course in [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] was offered on Friday nights to keep the enrollment manageable. Among his many eccentricities, he would not teach without a can of [[Coca-Cola]], and handed out prizes ranging from [[Hershey bar]]s to [[pocket knives]] to students who asked questions in class or did well on tests.<ref>{{cite news | author = Wesley T.

Rota began his career as a [[functional analysis|functional analyst]], but switched to become a distinguished [[combinatorics|combinatorialist]]. His series of ten papers on the "Foundations of Combinatorics" in the 1960s is credited with making it a respectable branch of modern mathematics.<ref name="web.mit.edu"/> He said that the one combinatorial idea he would like to be remembered for is the correspondence between combinatorial problems and problems of the location of the zeroes of [[polynomial]]s.<ref name="LANL Gian-Carlo Rota and David Sharp">{{cite web | title=Mathematics, Philosophy, and Artificial Intelligence: a dialogue with Gian-Carlo Rota and David Sharp | website=LANL | url=https://la-science.lanl.gov/lascience12.shtml | year=1985 | volume=12 | access-date=2024-01-31 | page=99}}</ref> He worked on the theory of [[incidence algebra]]s (which generalize the 19th-century theory of [[Möbius inversion formula|Möbius inversion]]) and popularized their study among combinatorialists, set the [[umbral calculus]] on a rigorous foundation, unified the theory of [[Sheffer sequence]]s and [[polynomial sequence]]s of [[binomial type]], and worked on fundamental problems in [[probability theory]]. His philosophical work was largely in the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl]].<ref name="Rota on Husserl 2000 ">{{cite book | last=Rota | first=Gian-Carlo | title=Phenomenology on Kant, German Idealism, Hermeneutics and Logic | chapter=Ten Remarks on Husserl and Phenomenology | series=Contributions to Phenomenology | publisher=Springer Netherlands | publication-place=Dordrecht | volume=39 | date=2000 | isbn=978-90-481-5448-7 | doi=10.1007/978-94-015-9446-2_7 | pages=89–97}}</ref>

Rota founded the ''[[Advances in Mathematics]]'' journal in 1961.<ref name="web.mit.edu"/>

==Death==
Rota died of [[Atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic cardiac disease]] on April 18, 1999, apparently in his sleep at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
