'''Thomas Jefferson''' (April 13, 1743{{efn|[[Old Style]]: April 2, 1743}} – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, planter, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] who served as the third [[president of the United States]] from 1801 to 1809.<ref name="Morris19732">{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Richard B. |author-link=Richard B. Morris |url=https://archive.org/details/sevenwhoshapedou00morr/page/n15/mode/2up |title=Seven Who Shaped Our Destiny: The Founding Fathers as Revolutionaries |publisher=Harper & Row |year=1973 |isbn=978-0060904548 |page=1}}</ref> He was the primary author of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Following the [[American Revolutionary War]] and before becoming president in 1801, Jefferson was the nation's first [[U.S. secretary of state]] under [[George Washington]] and then the nation's second [[vice president of the United States|vice president]] under [[John Adams]]. Jefferson was a leading proponent of democracy, [[republicanism]], and [[Natural law|natural rights]], and he produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national, and international levels. 

Jefferson was born into the [[Colony of Virginia]]'s [[planter class]], dependent on [[slavery in the colonial history of the United States|slave labor]]. During the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia at the [[Second Continental Congress]]. He served as the second [[governor of Virginia|governor]] of [[Virginia in the American Revolution|revolutionary Virginia]] from 1779 to 1781. In 1785, [[Congress of the Confederation|Congress]] appointed Jefferson [[List of ambassadors of the United States to France|U.S. minister to France]], where he served from 1785 to 1789. President Washington then appointed Jefferson the nation's first secretary of state, where he served from 1790 to 1793. During this time, in the early 1790s, Jefferson and political ally [[James Madison]] organized the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] to oppose the [[Federalist Party]] during the formation of the nation's [[First Party System]]. Jefferson and Federalist [[John Adams]] became both personal friends and political rivals. In the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 U.S. presidential election]] between the two, Jefferson came in second, which made him Adams' vice president under the electoral laws of the time. Four years later, in the [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 presidential election]], Jefferson again challenged Adams and won the presidency. In [[1804 United States presidential election|1804]], Jefferson was reelected overwhelmingly to a second term.

As president, Jefferson assertively defended the nation's shipping and trade interests against [[Barbary pirates]] and aggressive British trade policies, promoted a western expansionist policy with the [[Louisiana Purchase]], which doubled the nation's geographic size, and was able to reduce military forces and expenditures following successful negotiations with France. In his second presidential term, Jefferson was beset by difficulties at home, including the trial of his former vice president [[Aaron Burr]]. In 1807, Jefferson implemented the [[Embargo Act]] to defend the nation's industries from British threats to U.S. shipping, limiting foreign trade and stimulating the birth of the [[Manufacturing in the United States|American manufacturing]] industry.

Jefferson is [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|ranked]] by both scholars and in public opinion among the upper tier of American presidents. Presidential scholars and historians praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance, his peaceful acquisition of the [[Louisiana Territory]] from France, and his leadership in supporting the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. They acknowledge the fact of his lifelong ownership of large numbers of slaves and give differing interpretations of his [[Thomas Jefferson and slavery|views on and relationship with slavery]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Cogliano |first=Francis |title=Thomas Jefferson: Reputation and Legacy |publisher=[[University of Virginia Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=9780813927336 |pages=217–219 |chapter=Slavery}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
{{Main|Early life and career of Thomas Jefferson}}
Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743 (April 2, 1743, [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]], [[Julian calendar]]), at the family's [[Shadwell, Virginia|Shadwell Plantation]] in the British [[Colony of Virginia]], the third of ten children.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 18.</ref> He was of [[English Americans|English]] and possibly [[Welsh Americans|Welsh]] descent, and was born a [[British subject]].<ref name=Malone5>[[#Malone48|Malone, 1948]], pp. 5–6.</ref> His father, [[Peter Jefferson]], was a planter and surveyor who died when Jefferson was fourteen; his mother was [[Jane Randolph Jefferson|Jane Randolph]].{{efn|Jefferson personally showed little interest in his ancestry; on his father's side, he only knew of the existence of his grandfather.<ref name=Malone5/><ref name=Brodie33>[[#Brodie|Brodie, 1974]], pp. 33–34.</ref> Malone writes that Jefferson vaguely knew that his grandfather "had a place on the Fluvanna River which he called [[Snowden Plantation|Snowden]] after a mountain in Wales near which the Jeffersons were supposed to have once lived".<ref name=Malone5/> See also [[Peter Jefferson#Ancestry]].}} Peter Jefferson moved his family to [[Tuckahoe (plantation)|Tuckahoe Plantation]] in 1745 on the death of [[William Randolph III (son of Thomas)|William Randolph III]], the plantation's owner and Jefferson's friend, who in his will had named Peter guardian of Randolph's children. The Jeffersons returned to Shadwell before October 1753.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kern|first=Susan A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Yl7PfOh6-0C&q=the+jefferson%27s+at+shawell|title=The Jefferson's at Shadwell|date=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0195169119|oclc=51854624 }}{{page needed|date=December 2023}}</ref>

Peter died in 1757, and his estate was divided between his sons Thomas and [[Randolph Jefferson|Randolph]].<ref>[[#Malone48|Malone, 1948]], pp. 31–33.</ref> [[John Harvie Sr.]] became 13-year-old Thomas' guardian.<ref name="Woods">{{Cite book |last=Woods |first=Edgar |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002672921&view=1up&seq=239&q1=Belmont |title=Albemarle County in Virginia |date=1901 |page=225|publisher=The Michie Company, printers}}</ref> Thomas inherited approximately {{cvt|5000|acre|ha sqmi|lk=off}}, which included [[Monticello]], and he assumed full legal authority over the property at age 21.<ref name=Malone437>[[#Malone48|Malone, 1948]], pp. 437–440.</ref>

===Education and early family life===
Jefferson began his education together with the [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolph]] children at Tuckahoe under tutors.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 19.</ref> Thomas' father Peter, who was self-taught and regretted not having a formal education, entered Thomas into an English school at age five. In 1752, at age nine, he attended a local school run by a Scottish Presbyterian minister and also began studying the natural world, which he grew to love. At this time he began studying [[Latin]], [[Greek Language|Greek]], and [[French Language|French]], while learning to ride horses as well. Thomas also read books from his father's modest library.<ref name=bowers12>[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], pp. 12–13.</ref> He was taught from 1758 to 1760 by the Reverend [[James Maury]] near [[Gordonsville, Virginia]], where he studied history, science, and the classics while boarding with Maury's family.<ref name=bowers12/><ref>[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], pp. 7–9.</ref> Jefferson came to know various American Indians, including the [[Cherokee]] chief [[Ostenaco]], who often stopped at Shadwell to visit on their way to [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] to trade.<ref>[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], p. 13</ref><ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 36</ref> In Williamsburg, the young Jefferson met and came to admire [[Patrick Henry]], eight years his senior, and shared a common interest in the playing of the violin.<ref>[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], pp. 14–15</ref>

[[File:ChristopherWrenBuilding.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Wren Building]] at the [[College of William & Mary]], where Jefferson studied]]
Jefferson entered the [[College of William & Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], in 1761, at the age of eighteen, and studied mathematics, metaphysics, and philosophy with [[William Small]]. Under Small's tutelage, Jefferson encountered the ideas of the British [[Empiricism|Empiricists]], including [[John Locke]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Small introduced Jefferson to [[George Wythe]] and [[Francis Fauquier]]. Small, Wythe, and Fauquier recognized Jefferson as a man of exceptional ability and included him in their inner circle, where he became a regular member of their Friday dinner parties. Jefferson later wrote that, while there, he "heard more common good sense, more rational & philosophical conversations than in all the rest of my life".<ref>[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], p. 25; [[#boles|Boles, 2017]], p. 17</ref>

During his first year at the college, Jefferson spent considerable time attending parties and dancing and was not very frugal with his expenditures; in his second year, regretting that he had squandered away time and money in his first year, he committed to studying fifteen hours a day.<ref>[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], pp. 22–23; [[#boles|Boles, 2017]], p. 18</ref> While at William & Mary, Jefferson became a member of the [[Flat Hat Club]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Millfeld |first=Becca |url=http://www.dogstreetjournal.com/story/2049 |title=Shhh!

Jefferson concluded his formal studies in April 1762.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=Gaye |title=Jefferson's Formal Education |url=https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/jeffersons-formal-education/#fn-7 |website=Monticello |publisher=Thomas Jefferson Foundation |access-date=May 5, 2024}}</ref> He [[Reading law|read the law]] under Wythe's tutelage while working as a [[law clerk]] in his office.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 29, 39.</ref> Jefferson was well-read in a broad variety of subjects, which, along with law and philosophy, included history, natural law, natural religion, ethics, and several areas in science, including agriculture. During his years of study under the watchful eye of Wythe, Jefferson authored a ''Commonplace Book'', a survey of his extensive readings.<ref>[[#chinard|Chinard, 1926]], book cover</ref> Wythe was so impressed with Jefferson that he later bequeathed his entire library to him.<ref>[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], pp. 32–34; [[#boles|Boles, 2017]], p. 19</ref>

On July 20, 1765, Jefferson's sister Martha married his close friend and college companion [[Dabney Carr (Virginia assemblyman)|Dabney Carr]], which was greatly pleasing to Jefferson. In October of that year, however, Jefferson mourned his sister Jane's unexpected death at age 25; he wrote a farewell [[epitaph]] for her in Latin.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 37</ref>

Jefferson treasured his books and amassed three sizable libraries in his lifetime. He began assembling his first library, which grew to 200 volumes, in his youth. It included books inherited from his father and left to him by Wythe.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 42.</ref> In 1770, however, Jefferson's first library was destroyed in a fire at his Shadwell home. His second library replenished the first. It grew to 1,250 titles by 1773, and to nearly 6,500 volumes by 1814.<ref>[[#Ferling2000|Ferling, 2000]], p. 43.</ref> Jefferson organized his books into three broad categories corresponding with elements of the human mind: memory, reason, and imagination.<ref>Murray, S. (2009). ''The library: An illustrated history''. Skyhorse Publishing. p. 163.</ref> After [[British Empire|British]] forces burnt the [[Library of Congress]] during the 1814 [[Burning of Washington]], Jefferson sold his second library to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] for $23,950, hoping to help jumpstart the Library of Congress's rebuilding. Jefferson used a portion of the proceeds to pay off some of his large debt. However, Jefferson soon resumed collecting what amounted to his third personal library, writing to [[John Adams]], "I cannot live without books."<ref name=library>[[#Library|Library of Congress]]</ref><ref>[[#boles|Boles, 2017]], p. 458</ref> By the time of his death a decade later, the library had grown to nearly 2,000 volumes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Root|first=Daniel|title=I cannot live without books|publisher=UWIRE Text|date=October 12, 2015}}</ref>

===Lawyer and House of Burgesses===
[[File:House of Burgesses in the Capitol Williamsburg James City County Virginia by Frances Benjamin Johnston.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Chamber of House of Burgesses|[[House of Burgesses]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], where Jefferson served from 1769 to 1775]]

Jefferson was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1767, and lived with his mother at Shadwell.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 11, 49.</ref> He represented [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] in the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]] from 1769 until 1775.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 40.</ref> He pursued reforms to slavery, including writing and sponsoring legislation in 1769 to strip power from the royal governor and courts, instead providing masters of slaves with the discretion to emancipate them. Jefferson persuaded his cousin [[Richard Bland]] to spearhead the legislation's passage, but it faced strong opposition in a state whose economy was largely agrarian.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 47–49.</ref>

Jefferson took seven cases of freedom-seeking enslaved people<ref>[[#Gordon08|Gordon-Reed, 2008]], p. 348.</ref> and waived his fee for one he claimed should be freed before the minimum statutory age for emancipation.<ref name=Gordon99>[[#Gordon08|Gordon-Reed, 2008]], pp. 99–100.</ref> Jefferson invoked [[natural law]], arguing "everyone comes into the world with a right to his own person and using it at his own will&nbsp;... This is what is called personal liberty, and is given him by the author of nature, because it is necessary for his own sustenance." The judge cut him off and ruled against his client. As a consolation, Jefferson gave his client some money, which was conceivably used to aid his escape shortly thereafter.<ref name=Gordon99/> However, Jefferson's underlying intellectual argument that all people were entitled by their creator to what he labeled a "natural right" to liberty is one he would later incorporate as he set about authoring the Declaration of Independence.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 49.</ref> He also took on 68 cases for the General Court of Virginia in 1767, in addition to three notable cases: ''Howell v. Netherland'' (1770), ''Bolling v. Bolling'' (1771), and ''Blair v. Blair'' (1772).<ref name=Konig_Time_Line>[[#Konig1|Konig, David T., Encyclopedia Virginia]]</ref>

Jefferson wrote a resolution calling for a "Day of Fasting and Prayer" and a boycott of all British goods in protest of the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] passing the [[Intolerable Acts]] in 1774. Jefferson's resolution was later expanded into ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]'', in which he argued that people have the right to [[Self-governing colony|govern themselves]].<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 71–73.</ref>

===Monticello, marriage, and family===

Martha later suffered from ill health, including diabetes, and frequent childbirth weakened her. Her mother had died young, and Martha lived with two stepmothers as a girl.

===Declaration of Independence===
{{Main|United States Declaration of Independence}}
[[File:United States Declaration of Independence.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], which Jefferson largely wrote in isolation between June 11 and 28, 1776, from a floor he was renting in a home at 700 [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]] in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City Philadelphia]],<ref name="nps.gov">[https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/independence-dechousehistory.htm "The Declaration House Through Time"], National Park Service</ref> are "the most potent and consequential words in American history," historian [[Joseph Ellis]] later wrote.]]

Jefferson was the primary author of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].<ref>[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], p. v</ref> At age 33, he was one of the youngest delegates to the [[Second Continental Congress]] beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]], where a formal declaration of independence from Britain was overwhelmingly favored.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 77.</ref> Jefferson was inspired by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of the sanctity of the individual, and the writings of [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Montesquieu]].<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 103–104.</ref>

Jefferson sought out [[John Adams]], a Continental Congress delegate from [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] and an emerging leader in the Congress.<ref>[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], p. 87.</ref> They became close friends, and Adams supported Jefferson's appointment to the [[Committee of Five]], charged by the Congress with authoring a declaration of independence. The five chosen were Adams, Jefferson, [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Robert R. Livingston]], and [[Roger Sherman]]. The committee initially thought that Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson. His choice was due to Jefferson being a Virginian, popular, and being considered a good writer by Adams.{{efn|Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question. Jefferson asked, "Why will you not? You ought to do it." To which Adams responded, "I will not—reasons enough." Jefferson replied, "What can be your reasons?" and Adams responded, "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." "Well," said Jefferson, "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can." Adams concluded, "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting."<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 102.</ref>}}

Jefferson consulted with his fellow committee members, but mostly wrote the Declaration of Independence in isolation between June 11 and 28, 1776, in a home he was renting at 700 [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]] in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City Philadelphia]].<ref name="nps.gov"/> Jefferson drew considerably on his proposed draft of the [[Constitution of Virginia|Virginia Constitution]], [[George Mason]]'s draft of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], and other sources.<ref>[[#Maier|Maier, 1997]], p. 104.</ref> Other committee members made some changes, and a final draft was presented to Congress on June 28, 1776.<ref name="Meacham, 2012, p. 105">[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 105.</ref>

The declaration was introduced on Friday, June 28, and Congress began debate over its contents on Monday, July 1,<ref name="Meacham, 2012, p. 105"/> resulting in the removal of roughly a fourth of Jefferson's original draft.<ref>[[David K.

Jefferson's preamble is regarded as an enduring statement on individual and human rights, and the phrase "[[all men are created equal]]" has been called "one of the best-known sentences in the English language". The Declaration of Independence, historian [[Joseph Ellis]] wrote in 2008, represents "the most potent and consequential words in American history".<ref name="Ellis, 1996, p. 50"/><ref>[[#Ellis2008|Ellis, 2008]], pp. 55–56.</ref>

In 1778, Jefferson was given the task of revising the state's laws. He drafted 126 bills in three years, including laws to streamline the judicial system. He proposed statutes that provided for general education, which he considered the basis of "republican government".<ref name="Peterson pp. 101"/> Jefferson also was concerned that Virginia's powerful landed gentry were becoming a hereditary aristocracy and took the lead in abolishing what he called "feudal and unnatural distinctions."<ref name = Brewer>{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = Holly | year = 1997 | title = Entailing Aristocracy in Colonial Virginia: 'Ancient Feudal Restraints' and Revolutionary Reform | journal = William and Mary Quarterly | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 307–346 | jstor=2953276 | doi=10.2307/2953276|issn=0043-5597 }}</ref> He targeted laws such as [[entail]] and [[primogeniture]] by which a deceased landowner's oldest son was vested with all land ownership and power.<ref name = Brewer/>{{efn|The [[Fee tail|entail]] laws made it perpetual: the one who inherited the land could not sell it, but had to bequeath it to his oldest son.

===''Notes on the State of Virginia''===
{{Main|Notes on the State of Virginia}}

In 1780, Jefferson received from French diplomat [[François Barbé-Marbois]] a letter of inquiry into the geography, history, and government of Virginia, as part of a study of the United States. Jefferson organized his responses in a book, ''Notes on the State of Virginia'' (1785).<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, pp. 165–166.</ref> He compiled the book over five years, including reviews of scientific knowledge, Virginia's history, politics, laws, culture, and geography.<ref>[[#Shuffelton|Shuffelton, 1999]]</ref> The book explores what constitutes a good society, using Virginia as an exemplar. Jefferson included extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy and wrote at length about slavery and [[miscegenation]]; he articulated his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free people in one society because of justified resentments of the enslaved.<ref>[[#Jeff Notes|Notes on the State of Virginia]], p. 149; [[#Burstein2006|Burstein, 2006]], p. 146.</ref> He also wrote of his views on the American Indians, equating them to European settlers.<ref>[[#Jeff Notes|''Notes on the State of Virginia'', 1853, Query XI]]</ref><ref>[[#TJFEnlightenment|TJF: Thomas Jefferson's Enlightenment and American Indians]]</ref>

Jefferson was appointed a Virginia delegate to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] organized following the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty]] with Great Britain in 1783. He was a member of the committee setting foreign exchange rates and [[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States|recommended]] an American currency based on the decimal system that was adopted.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, pp. 172–173.</ref> He advised the formation of the [[Committee of the States]] to fill the power vacuum when Congress was in recess.<ref>[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], p. 275.</ref> The committee met when Congress adjourned, but disagreements rendered it dysfunctional.<ref>[[#Rayner34|Rayner, 1834]], p. 207.</ref>

In the Congress's 1783–1784 session, Jefferson acted as chairman of committees to establish a viable system of government for the new Republic and to propose a policy for settlement of the western territories. He was the principal author of the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]], whereby Virginia ceded to the national government the vast area that it claimed northwest of the [[Ohio River]]. He insisted that this territory should not be used as colonial territory by any of the thirteen states, but that it should be divided into sections that could become states. He plotted borders for nine new states in their initial stages and wrote an ordinance banning slavery in all the nation's territories. Congress made extensive revisions and rejected the ban on slavery.<ref name=Peretson189>[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]], pp. 189–190.</ref><ref>[[#Finkelman1989|Finkelman, 1989]], pp. 21–51.</ref> The provisions banning slavery, known as the "Jefferson Proviso", were modified and implemented three years later in the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 and became the law for the entire [[Northwest Territory]].<ref name=Peretson189/>

During the summer of 1786, Jefferson arrived in London to meet with John Adams, the US Ambassador to Britain. Adams had official access to [[George III]] and arranged a meeting between Jefferson and the king. Jefferson later described the king's reception of the men as "ungracious." According to Adams's grandson, George III turned his back on both in a gesture of public insult.

He later left the cabinet voluntarily.<ref>[[#Chernow04|Chernow, 2004]], p. 427.</ref>

The second major issue was the capital's permanent location. Hamilton favored a capital close to the major commercial centers of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], while Washington, Jefferson, and other agrarians wanted it further south.<ref name="Cooke, 1970, pp. 523–45">[[#Cooke|Cooke, 1970]], pp. 523–545.</ref> After lengthy deadlock, the [[Compromise of 1790]] was struck, permanently locating the capital on the [[Potomac River]], and the federal government assumed the war debts of all original [[Thirteen colonies|13 states]].<ref name="Cooke, 1970, pp. 523–45"/>

Jefferson's goals were to decrease American dependence on British commerce and to expand commercial trade with France. He sought to weaken Spanish colonialism of the [[Appalachian Mountains|trans-Appalachian West]] and British control in the North, believing this would aid in the pacification of Native Americans.<ref>[[#Petterson2002|Peterson (2002), pp.40–41]]</ref>

Jefferson and political protegé Congressman [[James Madison]] founded the ''[[National Gazette]]'' in 1791, along with author [[Phillip Freneau]], to counter Hamilton's Federalist policies, which Hamilton was promoting through the influential Federalist newspaper the ''[[Gazette of the United States]]''. The ''National Gazette ''made particular criticism of the policies promoted by Hamilton, often through anonymous essays signed by the pen name ''Brutus'' at Jefferson's urging, which were written by Madison.<ref>[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 96.</ref> In Spring 1791, Jefferson and Madison took a vacation to [[Vermont]]; Jefferson had been suffering from migraines and was tiring of the in-fighting with Hamilton.<ref name=Randall_1996_p1>[[#Randall 1996|Randall (1996)]], p. 1.</ref>

In May 1792, Jefferson became alarmed at the political rivalries taking shape; he wrote to Washington, imploring him to run for reelection that year as a unifying influence.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 429.</ref> He urged the president to rally the citizenry to a party that would defend democracy against the corrupting influence of banks and monied interests, as espoused by the Federalists. Historians recognize this letter as the earliest delineation of [[Democratic-Republican Party]] principles.<ref>[[#Greider2010|Greider, 2010]], p. 246.</ref> Jefferson, Madison, and other Democratic-Republican organizers favored [[states' rights]] and local control and opposed the federal concentration of power, whereas Hamilton sought more power for the federal government.<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 145–149.</ref>

Jefferson supported France against Britain when the two nations fought in 1793, though his arguments in the Cabinet were undercut by French Revolutionary envoy [[Edmond-Charles Genêt]]'s open scorn for Washington.<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 186–188.</ref> In his discussions with British Minister [[George Hammond (diplomat)|George Hammond]], he tried in vain to persuade the British to vacate their posts in the Northwest and to compensate the U.S. for enslaved people whom the British had freed at the end of the war. Jefferson sought a return to private life, and resigned from the cabinet position in December 1793; he may also have wanted to bolster his political influence from outside the administration.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 523; [[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], p. 119; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 283–284.</ref>

After the Washington administration negotiated the [[Jay Treaty]] with Britain in 1794, Jefferson saw a cause around which to rally his party and organized a national opposition from Monticello.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 293–294.</ref> The treaty, designed by Hamilton, aimed to reduce tensions and increase trade. Jefferson warned that it would increase British influence and subvert republicanism, calling it "the boldest act [Hamilton and Jay] ever ventured on to undermine the government".<ref>[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], ch.8 [e-book].</ref> The Treaty passed, but it expired in 1805 during Jefferson's presidential administration and was not renewed. Jefferson continued his pro-France stance; during the violence of the [[Reign of Terror]], he declined to disavow the revolution: "To back away from France would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in America."<ref>[[#Yarbrough2006|Yarbrough, 2006]], p. xx.</ref>

[[File:ElectoralCollege1796.svg|thumb|alt=Electoral College map|The results of the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 U.S. presidential election]] between Adams and Jefferson, won by Adams]]

In the [[1796 United States presidential election|presidential campaign of 1796]], Jefferson lost the electoral college vote to Federalist [[John Adams]] 71–68 and was thus elected vice president. As presiding officer of the Senate, he assumed a more passive role than his predecessor John Adams. He allowed the Senate to freely conduct debates and confined his participation to procedural issues, which he called an "honorable and easy" role.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 305.</ref> Jefferson had previously studied parliamentary law and procedure for 40 years, making him quite qualified to serve as presiding officer. In 1800, he published his assembled notes on Senate procedure as ''[[Jefferson's Manual|A Manual of Parliamentary Practice]]''.<ref>[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 117–118.</ref> He cast only three [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents of the United States|tie-breaking votes]] in the Senate.

In four confidential talks with French consul Joseph Létombe in the spring of 1797, Jefferson attacked Adams and predicted that his rival would serve only one term. He also encouraged France to invade England, and advised Létombe to stall any American envoys sent to Paris.<ref>[[#Elkins1994|Elkins, 1994]], p. 566.</ref> This toughened the tone that the French government adopted toward the Adams administration. After Adams's initial peace envoys were rebuffed, Jefferson and his supporters lobbied for the release of papers related to the incident, called the [[XYZ Affair]] after the letters used to disguise the identities of the French officials involved.<ref>[[#Chernow04|Chernow, 2004]], p. 550.</ref> However, the tactic backfired when it was revealed that French officials had demanded bribes, rallying public support against France. The U.S. began an undeclared naval war with France known as the [[Quasi-War]].<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 312.</ref>

During the Adams presidency, the Federalists rebuilt the military, levied new taxes, and enacted the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]. Jefferson believed these laws were intended to suppress Democratic-Republicans, rather than prosecute enemy aliens, and considered them unconstitutional.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, p. 54.</ref> To rally opposition, he and James Madison anonymously wrote the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]], declaring that the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states.<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 269–271.</ref> The resolutions followed the "[[interposition]]" approach of Madison, that states may shield their citizens from federal laws that they deem unconstitutional. Jefferson advocated [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]], allowing states to invalidate federal laws altogether.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 318.</ref>{{efn|Jefferson's Kentucky draft said: "where powers are assumed which have not been delegated, a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy: that every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact, (casus non fœderis) to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits."<ref>[[#UCP|Thomas Jefferson, Resolutions Relative to the Alien and Sedition Acts, 1798]]</ref>}} He warned that, "unless arrested at the threshold", the Alien and Sedition Acts would "drive these states into revolution and blood".<ref>[[#Onuf2000|Onuf, 2000]], p. 73.</ref>

Historian [[Ron Chernow]] claims that "the theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions was deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion", contributing to the [[American Civil War]] as well as later events.<ref>[[#Chernow04|Chernow, 2004]], p. 574.</ref> Washington was so appalled by the resolutions that he told Patrick Henry that, if "systematically and pertinaciously pursued", the resolutions would "dissolve the union or produce coercion."<ref name="Chernow587">[[#Chernow04|Chernow, 2004]], p. 587.</ref> Jefferson had always admired Washington's leadership skills but felt that his Federalist party was leading the country in the wrong direction. He decided not to attend Washington's funeral in 1799 because of acute differences with him while serving as secretary of state.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 323.</ref>

===Election of 1800===
{{Main|1800 United States presidential election}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1800.svg|thumb|alt=Electoral College map|The results of the [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 presidential election]] between [[John Adams|Adams]] and Jefferson, won by Jefferson]]

Jefferson contended for president once more against [[John Adams]] in 1800. Adams' campaign was weakened by unpopular taxes and vicious Federalist infighting over his actions in the Quasi-War.<ref>[[#McCullough|McCullough, 2001]], p. 556; [[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 126–128.</ref> Democratic-Republicans pointed to the Alien and Sedition Acts and accused the Federalists of being secret pro-Britain monarchists, while Federalists charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine beholden to the French.<ref>[[#McCullough|McCullough, 2001]], pp. 543–544.</ref> Historian [[Joyce Appleby]] said the election was "one of the most acrimonious in the annals of American history".<ref>[[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], pp. 27–28.</ref>

The Democratic-Republicans ultimately won more electoral college votes, due in part to the electors that resulted from the addition of three-fifths of the South's slaves to the population calculation under the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]].<ref>[https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n10/eric-foner/the-corrupt-bargain The Corrupt Bargain], Eric Foner, The London Review of Books, Vol. 42 No. 10, May 21, 2020, accessed November 3, 2020</ref> Jefferson and his vice-presidential candidate [[Aaron Burr]] unexpectedly received an equal total. Because of the tie, the election was decided by the Federalist-dominated House of Representatives.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, p. 75; [[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 278.</ref>{{efn|This electoral process problem was addressed by the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1804, which provided separate votes for presidential and vice-presidential candidates.<ref name=W284/>}} Hamilton lobbied Federalist representatives on Jefferson's behalf, believing him a lesser political evil than Burr. On February 17, 1801, after thirty-six ballots, the House elected Jefferson president and Burr vice president.<ref name=W284/>

The win was marked by Democratic-Republican celebrations throughout the country.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 340–341.</ref> Some of Jefferson's opponents argued that he owed his victory to the South's inflated number of electors.<ref>[[#Ferling04|Ferling, 2004]], p. 208.</ref> Others alleged that Jefferson secured [[James A. Bayard (elder)|James Asheton Bayard]]'s tie-breaking electoral vote by guaranteeing the retention of various Federalist posts in the government.<ref name=W284>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 284–285.</ref> Jefferson disputed the allegation, and the historical record is inconclusive.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 337–338.</ref>

The transition proceeded smoothly, marking a watershed in American history. As historian [[Gordon S. Wood]] writes, "it was one of the first popular elections in modern history that resulted in the [[peaceful transition of power|peaceful transfer of power]] from one 'party' to another."<ref name=W284/>

==Presidency (1801–1809)==
{{Main|Presidency of Thomas Jefferson}}
[[File:Reproduction-of-the-1805-Rembrandt-Peale-painting-of-Thomas-Jefferson-New-York-Historical-Society 1.jpg|thumb|left|''Thomas Jefferson'', an 1805 portrait by [[Rembrandt Peale]]]]

Jefferson was [[First inauguration of Thomas Jefferson|sworn in as president]] by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] at the new [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] in Washington, D.C., on March 4, 1801. His inauguration was not attended by outgoing President Adams. In contrast to his two predecessors, Jefferson exhibited a dislike of formal etiquette. Plainly dressed, he chose to walk alongside friends to the Capitol from his nearby boardinghouse that day instead of arriving by carriage.<ref>[[#Peterson2002|Peterson (2002), p. 39]]</ref> His inaugural address struck a note of reconciliation and commitment to democratic ideology, declaring, "We have been called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists."<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 348–350.</ref><ref name=Peterson41/> Ideologically, he stressed "equal and exact justice to all men", minority rights, and freedom of speech, religion, and press.<ref name=Peterson_2002_p40>[[#Peterson2002|Peterson, 2002]], p. 40.</ref> He said that a free and republican government was "the strongest government on earth."<ref name=Peterson_2002_p40/> He nominated moderate Republicans to his cabinet: James Madison as secretary of state, [[Henry Dearborn]] as secretary of war, [[Levi Lincoln Sr.|Levi Lincoln]] as attorney general, and [[Robert Smith (Cabinet member)|Robert Smith]] as secretary of the navy.<ref name=Peterson41/>

Widowed since 1782, Jefferson first relied on his two daughters to serve as his official hostesses.{{sfn|Hendricks|2015|pp=21–22}} In late May 1801, he asked [[Dolley Madison]], wife of his long-time friend James Madison, to be the permanent White House hostess. She was also in charge of the completion of the White House mansion. Dolley served as White House hostess for the rest of Jefferson's two terms and then for another eight years as First Lady while her husband was president.{{sfn|Hendricks|2015|pp=21–22}}

===Financial affairs===
[[File:Albert Gallatin (by Gilbert Stuart).jpg|thumb|[[Albert Gallatin]], Jefferson's [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|treasury secretary]], depicted in a portrait by [[Gilbert Stuart]]]]

Jefferson's first challenge as president was shrinking the $83&nbsp;million national debt.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 352</ref> He began dismantling Hamilton's Federalist fiscal system with help from the secretary of the treasury, Albert Gallatin.<ref name=Peterson41>[[#Peterson2002|Peterson, 2002]], p. 41.</ref> Gallatin devised a plan to eliminate the national debt in sixteen years by extensive annual appropriations and reduction in taxes.<ref name="Peterson pp. 43-44">[[#Peterson2002|Peterson, 2002]], pp. 43–44.</ref> The administration eliminated the whiskey excise and other taxes after closing "unnecessary offices" and cutting "useless establishments and expenses".<ref name="Wood, 2010, p. 293">[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 293.</ref><ref>[[#Bailey2007|Bailey, 2007]], p. 216.</ref>

Jefferson believed that the [[First Bank of the United States]] represented a "most deadly hostility" to republican government.<ref name="Peterson pp. 43-44"/> He wanted to dismantle the bank before its charter expired in 1811, but was dissuaded by Gallatin.<ref>[[#Wills02|Wills, 2002]], pp. 50–51.</ref> Gallatin argued that the national bank was a useful financial institution and set out to expand its operations.<ref name="Peterson p. 44">[[#Peterson2002|Peterson, 2002]], p. 44.</ref> Jefferson looked to other corners to address the growing national debt.<ref name="Peterson p. 44"/> He shrank the Navy, for example, deeming it unnecessary in peacetime, and incorporated a fleet of inexpensive gunboats intended only for local defense to avoid provocation against foreign powers.<ref name="Wood, 2010, p. 293"/> After two terms, he had lowered the national debt from $83&nbsp;million to $57&nbsp;million.<ref name=Meacham387>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 387.</ref>

===Domestic affairs===
Jefferson pardoned several of those imprisoned under the Alien and Sedition Acts.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 357.</ref> Congressional Republicans repealed the [[Midnight Judges Act|Judiciary Act of 1801]], which removed nearly all of Adams's "midnight judges". A subsequent appointment battle led to the Supreme Court's landmark decision in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', asserting judicial review over executive branch actions.<ref name="Meacham, 2012, p. 413">[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 375.</ref> Jefferson appointed three [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court justices]]: [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]] (1804), [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] (1807), and [[Thomas Todd]] (1807).<ref>[[#Urofsky|Urofsky, 2006]], p. viii.</ref>

Jefferson strongly felt the need for a national military university, producing an officer engineering corps for a national defense based on the advancement of the sciences, rather than having to rely on foreign sources.<ref>[[#Scythes1|Scythes, 2014]], pp. 693–694.</ref> He signed the [[Military Peace Establishment Act]] on March 16, 1802, founding the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]]. The act documented a new set of laws and limits for the military. Jefferson was also hoping to bring reform to the Executive branch, replacing Federalists and active opponents throughout the officer corps to promote Republican values.<ref>[[#Scythes1|Scythes, 2014]], pp. 422–423.</ref>

Jefferson took great interest in the [[Library of Congress]], which had been established in 1800. He often recommended books to acquire. In 1802, Congress authorized Jefferson to name the first Librarian of Congress, and formed a committee to establish library regulations. Congress also granted both the president and vice president the right to use the library.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0838909911|page=[https://archive.org/details/libraryillustrat0000murr/page/156 156]|url=https://archive.org/details/libraryillustrat0000murr/page/156}}</ref>

===Foreign affairs (1801–1805)===

====First Barbary War====
{{Main|First Barbary War}}
[[File:1800 map Afrique by Arrowsmith BPL 15210 detail2.jpg|thumb|alt=Map. Barbary Coast of North Africa 1806|The [[Barbary Coast]] of North Africa in 1806, including (from left to right): [[Morocco]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Tunis]], and [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]]]]

American merchant ships had been protected from [[Barbary Coast]] pirates by the [[Royal Navy]] when the states were British colonies.<ref>[[#Fremont-Barnes|Fremont-Barnes, 2006]], p. 32.</ref> After independence, however, pirates often captured U.S. merchant ships, pillaged cargoes, and enslaved or held crew members for ransom. Jefferson had opposed paying tribute to the Barbary States since 1785. In 1801, he authorized a U.S. Navy fleet under Commodore [[Richard Dale]] to make a show of force in the Mediterranean, the first American naval squadron to cross the Atlantic.<ref name="Meacham pp. 364">[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 364–365.</ref> Following the fleet's first engagement, he successfully asked Congress for a declaration of war.<ref name="Meacham pp. 364"/> The "First Barbary War" was the first foreign war fought by the U.S.<ref>[[#CITEREFHerring2008|Herring, 2008]], p. 97.</ref>

[[Pasha]] of [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] [[Yusuf Karamanli]] captured the {{USS|Philadelphia|1799|6}}, so Jefferson authorized [[William Eaton (soldier)|William Eaton]], the U.S. Consul to [[Tunis]], to lead a force to restore the pasha's older brother to the throne.<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 638.</ref> The American navy forced Tunis and Algiers into breaking their alliance with Tripoli. Jefferson ordered five separate naval bombardments of Tripoli, leading the pasha to sign a treaty that restored peace in the Mediterranean.<ref>[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 146.</ref> This victory proved only temporary, but according to Wood, "many Americans celebrated it as a vindication of their policy of spreading free trade around the world and as a great victory for liberty over tyranny."<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 639.</ref>

====Louisiana Purchase====
{{Main|Louisiana Purchase}}
[[File:Louisiana Purchase.png|thumb|The 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]], completed during [[Presidency of Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's presidency]], added {{convert|827987|lk=in|mi2|abbr=off}}, which doubled the geographic size of the United States.]]

Spain [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|ceded ownership]] of the Louisiana territory in 1800 to France. Jefferson was concerned that [[Napoleon]]'s interests in the vast territory would threaten the security of the continent and [[Mississippi River]] shipping. He wrote that the cession "works most sorely on the U.S. It completely reverses all the political relations of the U.S."<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 383–384.</ref> In 1802, he instructed [[James Monroe]] and [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]] to negotiate the purchase of [[New Orleans]] and adjacent coastal areas.<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 368.</ref> In early 1803, Jefferson offered Napoleon nearly $10&nbsp;million for {{convert|40000|mi2|abbr=off}} of tropical territory.<ref name=Freehling2005>[[#Freehling05|Freehling, 2005]], p. 69.</ref>

Napoleon realized that French military control was impractical over such a vast remote territory, and he was in dire need of funds for his [[The United Kingdom in the Napoleonic Wars|wars on the home front]]. In early April 1803, he unexpectedly made negotiators a counter-offer to sell {{convert|827987|mi2|abbr=off}} of French territory for $15&nbsp;million (~${{Format price|{{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=15000000|start_year=1803}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}), doubling the size of the United States.<ref name=Freehling2005/> U.S. negotiators accepted the offer and signed the treaty on April 30, 1803.<ref name="Meacham387"/> Word of the unexpected purchase did not reach Jefferson until July 3, 1803.<ref name="Meacham387"/> He unknowingly acquired the most fertile tract of land of its size on Earth, making the new country self-sufficient in food and other resources. The sale also significantly curtailed European presence in North America, removing obstacles to U.S. [[Territorial evolution of the United States|westward expansion]].<ref name=Ellis208>[[#Ellis2008|Ellis, 2008]], pp. 207–208.</ref>

Most thought that this was an exceptional opportunity, despite Republican reservations about the Constitutional authority of the federal government to acquire land.<ref name="The Rise of American Democracy">[[#Wilentz|Wilentz, 2005]], p. 108.</ref> Jefferson initially thought that a Constitutional [[History of the United States Constitution#Senate changes|amendment]] was necessary to purchase and govern the new territory; but he later changed his mind, fearing that this would give cause to oppose the purchase, and urged a speedy debate and ratification.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 389–390.</ref> On October 20, 1803, the Senate ratified the purchase treaty by a vote of 24–7.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, pp. 152–154.</ref> Jefferson personally was humble about acquiring the Louisiana Territory, but he resented complainers who called the vast domain a "howling wilderness".<ref>[[#Peterson2002|Peterson (2002), p. 47]]</ref>

After the purchase, Jefferson preserved the region's Spanish legal code and instituted a gradual approach to integrating settlers into American democracy. He believed that a period of the federal rule would be necessary while Louisianans adjusted to their new nation.<ref>[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], p. 777; [[#Ellis2008|Ellis, 2008]], p. 230; [[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 372.</ref>{{efn|Louisiana nevertheless gained statehood nine years later in 1812.<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 373.</ref>}} Historians have differed in their assessments regarding the constitutional implications of the sale,<ref>[[#Ellis2008|Ellis, 2008]], pp. 231–232.</ref> but they typically hail the Louisiana acquisition as a major accomplishment.

Jefferson anticipated further westward settlements due to the Louisiana Purchase and arranged for the exploration and mapping of the uncharted territory. He sought to establish a U.S. claim ahead of competing European interests and to find the rumored [[Northwest Passage]].<ref name="Ambrose76">[[#Ambrose|Ambrose, 1996]], pp. 76, 418.</ref> Jefferson and others were influenced by exploration accounts of [[Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz|Le Page du Pratz]] in Louisiana (1763) and [[James Cook]] in the Pacific (1784),<ref>[[#Ambrose|Ambrose, 1996]], p. 154.</ref> and they persuaded Congress in 1804 to fund an expedition to explore and [[:File:Lewis and Clark Expidition Map.jpg|map]] the newly acquired territory to the Pacific Ocean.<ref>[[#Rodriguez|Rodriguez, 2002]], pp. xxiv, 162, 185.</ref>

Jefferson appointed secretary [[Meriwether Lewis]] and acquaintance [[William Clark]] to lead the [[Corps of Discovery]] (1803–1806).<ref>[[#Rodriguez|Rodriguez, 2002]], pp. 112, 186.</ref> In the months leading up to the expedition, Jefferson tutored Lewis in the sciences of mapping, botany, natural history, mineralogy, and astronomy and navigation, giving him unlimited access to his library at Monticello, which included the largest collection of books in the world on the subject of the geography and natural history of the North American continent, along with an impressive collection of maps.<ref>[[#Ambrose|Ambrose, 1996]], pp. 54, 80.</ref>

The expedition [[Timeline of the Lewis and Clark Expedition|lasted from May 1804 to September 1806]] and obtained a wealth of scientific and geographic knowledge, including knowledge of many Indian tribes.<ref>[[#Ambrose|Ambrose, 1996]], pp. 154, 409, 512.</ref>

Jefferson organized three other western expeditions: the [[Dunbar and Hunter Expedition|William Dunbar and George Hunter Expedition]] on the [[Ouachita River]] (1804–1805), the [[Red River Expedition (1806)|Thomas Freeman and Peter Custis Expedition]] (1806) on the [[Red River of the South|Red River]], and the [[Pike Expedition|Zebulon Pike Expedition]] (1806–1807) into the Rocky Mountains and the Southwest. All three produced valuable information about the American frontier.<ref>[[#Berry|Berry, 2006]], p. xi.</ref> This interest also motivated Jefferson to meet the Prussian explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] several times in June 1804, inquiring into Humboldt's knowledge of New Spain's natural resources, economic prospects, and demographic development.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Daum | first=Andreas W.|author-link=Andreas Daum | year=2024 | title=Alexander von Humboldt: A Concise Biography | location=Trans.

Jefferson refuted the contemporary notion that Indians were inferior and maintained that they were equal in body and mind to people of European descent,<ref>[[#TJF:Indians|TJF: American Indians]]</ref> although he believed them to be inferior in terms of culture and technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/thomas-jeffersons-enlightenment-and-american-indians|title=Thomas Jefferson's Enlightenment and American Indians|publisher=Thomas Jefferson Foundation|access-date=2024-07-10}}/</ref> As governor of Virginia during the Revolutionary War, Jefferson recommended moving the [[Cherokee]] and [[Shawnee]] tribes, who had allied with the British, to west of the Mississippi River. But when he took office as president, he quickly took measures to avert another major conflict, as American and Indian societies were in collision and the British were inciting Indian tribes from Canada.<ref name="Miller2008">[[#Miller08|Miller, 2008]], p. 90.</ref><ref name=Sheehan1974>[[#Sheehan74|Sheehan, 1974]], pp. 120–121.</ref> In Georgia, he stipulated that the state would release its legal claims for lands to its west in exchange for military support in expelling the Cherokee from Georgia. This facilitated his policy of western expansion, to "advance compactly as we multiply".<ref>[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], ch. 9.</ref>

In keeping with his [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, President Jefferson adopted an assimilation policy toward American Indians known as his "civilization program" which included securing peaceful U.S.–Indian treaty alliances and encouraging agriculture. Jefferson advocated that Indian tribes should make federal purchases by credit holding their lands as collateral. Various tribes accepted Jefferson's policies, including the Shawnees led by [[Black Hoof]], the [[Muscogee]], and the Cherokee. However, some Shawnees, led by [[Tecumseh]], broke off from Black Hoof, and opposed Jefferson's assimilation policies.<ref>[[#TJFIndian Nations|TJF: President Jefferson and the Indian Nations]]</ref>

Historian Bernard Sheehan argues that Jefferson believed that assimilation was best for American Indians, and next-best was removal to the west; he felt that the worst outcome of the conflict would be their attacking the whites.<ref name=Sheehan1974/> Jefferson told [[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]] [[Henry Dearborn]], who then oversaw Indian affairs, "If we are constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe, we will never lay it down until that tribe is exterminated or driven beyond the Mississippi."<ref>[[#morals|The Life and Writings of Thomas Jefferson]], pp. 265–266.</ref> Miller agrees that Jefferson believed that Indians should assimilate to American customs and agriculture. Historians such as [[Peter S. Onuf]] and Merrill D. Peterson argue that Jefferson's actual Indian policies did little to promote assimilation and were a pretext to seize lands.<ref>[[#Miller08|Miller, 2008]], p. 94.</ref>

===Re-election in 1804 and second term===
{{further|1804 United States presidential election}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1804.svg|thumb|alt=Electoral College map|Results from the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 U.S. presidential election]] in which Jefferson was reelected overwhelmingly to a second term as president]]

Jefferson was nominated for reelection by the Republican party, with [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] replacing Burr as his running mate.<ref name=Meacham405>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 405–406.</ref> The Federalist party ran [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] of South Carolina, John Adams's vice-presidential candidate in the 1800 election. The Jefferson-Clinton ticket won overwhelmingly in the electoral college vote, by 162 to 14, promoting their achievement of a strong economy, lower taxes, and the Louisiana Purchase.<ref name=Meacham405/>

In March 1806, a split developed in the Republican party, led by fellow Virginian and former Republican ally [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]], who viciously accused President Jefferson on the floor of the House of moving too far in the Federalist direction. In so doing, Randolph permanently set himself apart [[Tertium quids|politically]] from Jefferson. Jefferson and Madison had backed resolutions to limit or ban British imports in retaliation for British seizures of American shipping. Also, in 1808, Jefferson was the first president to propose a broad Federal plan to build roads and canals across several states, asking for $20&nbsp;million, further alarming Randolph and believers of limited government.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 415–417.</ref>

Jefferson's popularity further suffered in his second term due to his response to wars in Europe. Positive relations with Britain had diminished, due partly to the antipathy between Jefferson and British diplomat [[Anthony Merry]]. After Napoleon's decisive victory at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in 1805, Napoleon became more aggressive in his negotiations over trading rights, which American efforts failed to counter. Jefferson then led the enactment of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], directed at both France and Britain. This triggered economic chaos in the U.S. and was strongly criticized, resulting in Jefferson having to abandon the policy a year later.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, pp. 291–294.</ref>

During the revolutionary era, the states abolished the international slave trade, but South Carolina reopened it. In his annual message of December 1806, Jefferson denounced the "violations of human rights" attending the international slave trade, calling on the newly elected Congress to criminalize it immediately. In 1807, Congress passed the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]], which Jefferson signed.<ref>[[#Miller80|Miller, 1980]], pp. 145–146.</ref><ref name="Randal583">[[#Randall|Randall, 1994]], p. 583.</ref> The act established severe punishment against the international slave trade, although it did not address the issue domestically.<ref>[[#Kaplan|Kaplan, 1999]], p. 407.</ref>

In Haiti, Jefferson's neutrality had allowed arms to enable the slave independence movement during its [[Haitian Revolution|Revolution]], and blocked attempts to assist Napoleon, who was defeated there in 1803.<ref name=jstorhaiti>[[#JeffHaiti|Jefferson, Haiti ''The Journal of Southern History'' 61, no. 2 (May 1995)]], p. 221.</ref> But his administration refused official recognition of the country during his second term, in deference to southern complaints about the racial violence against slave-holders; it was eventually extended to Haiti in 1862.<ref>[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 146–147.</ref>

===Controversies===

====Burr conspiracy and trial====
{{further|Burr–Hamilton duel|Burr conspiracy}}

Following the 1801 electoral deadlock, Jefferson's relationship with his vice president, [[Aaron Burr]], rapidly eroded. Jefferson suspected Burr of seeking the presidency for himself, while Burr was angered by Jefferson's refusal to appoint some of his supporters to federal office. Burr was dropped from the Democratic-Republican ticket in 1804 in favor of charismatic [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]].

[[File:Vanderlyn Burr.jpg|thumb|left|An 1802 portrait of [[Aaron Burr]] by [[John Vanderlyn]]]]

The same year, Burr was soundly defeated in his bid to be elected New York governor. During the campaign, [[Alexander Hamilton]] publicly made callous remarks regarding Burr's moral character.<ref name=Chernow04_p714>[[#Chernow04|Chernow, 2004]], p. 714.</ref> Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel, mortally wounding him on July 11, 1804. Burr was indicted for Hamilton's murder in New York and New Jersey, causing him to flee to Georgia, although he remained president of the Senate during Supreme Court Justice [[Samuel Chase]]'s [[Impeachment of Samuel Chase|impeachment trial]].<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 385–386.</ref> Both indictments quietly died and Burr was not prosecuted.{{sfn|Banner|1974|p=34}} Also during the election, certain New England separatists approached Burr, desiring a New England federation and intimating that he would be their leader.{{sfn|Banner|1974|pp=34–35}} However, nothing came of the plot, since Burr had lost the election and his reputation was ruined after killing Hamilton.{{sfn|Banner|1974|pp=34–35}} In August 1804, Burr contacted British Minister [[Anthony Merry]] offering to cede U.S. western territory in return for money and British ships.<ref name="The Burr Conspiracy 2000">[[#TBC 2000|The Burr Conspiracy (2000)]]</ref>

After leaving office in April 1805, Burr traveled west and conspired with Louisiana Territory governor [[James Wilkinson]], beginning a large-scale recruitment for a military expedition.<ref name=Peterson_2002_p50>[[#Peterson2002|Peterson, 2002]], p. 50.</ref> Other plotters included Ohio Senator [[John Smith (Ohio Senator)|John Smith]] and Irishman [[Harman Blennerhassett]].<ref name=Peterson_2002_p50/> Burr discussed seizing control of Mexico or Spanish Florida, or forming a secessionist state in New Orleans or the Western U.S.; historians remain unclear as to his true goal.<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 385–386; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 420, 422.</ref>{{efn|Further complicating matters, Wilkinson was posthumously revealed to have been in the simultaneous pay of the British, French, and Spanish.<ref>[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 161–162.</ref>}} In the fall of 1806, Burr launched a military flotilla carrying about 60 men down the [[Ohio River]]. Wilkinson renounced the plot and reported Burr's expedition to Jefferson, who ordered Burr's arrest.<ref name=Peterson_2002_p50/><ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 420.</ref>{{sfn|Banner|1974|p=37}} On February 13, 1807, Burr was captured in Louisiana and sent to Virginia to be tried for treason.<ref name="The Burr Conspiracy 2000"/>

Burr's 1807 conspiracy trial became a national issue.<ref>[[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], p. 100; [[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 162.</ref> Jefferson attempted to preemptively influence the verdict by telling Congress that Burr's guilt was "beyond question", but the case came before his longtime political foe [[John Marshall]], who dismissed the treason charge. Burr's legal team subpoenaed Jefferson, but Jefferson refused to testify, making the first argument for [[executive privilege]]. Instead, Jefferson provided relevant legal documents.<ref>[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 163–164; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 422–423.</ref> After a three-month trial, the jury found Burr not guilty, while Jefferson denounced his acquittal.{{sfn|Banner|1974|p=37}}<ref>[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 165.</ref>{{efn|Burr then left for Europe and eventually returned to practicing law.}}<ref>[[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], p. 101.</ref> Jefferson subsequently removed Wilkinson as territorial governor but retained him in the U.S. military. Historian James N. Banner criticized Jefferson for continuing to trust Wilkinson, a "faithless plotter".{{sfn|Banner|1974|p=37}}

====Wilkinson's misconduct====
Commanding General [[James Wilkinson]] was a holdover of the Washington and Adams administrations. In 1804, Wilkinson received 12,000 pesos from the Spanish for information on American boundary plans.{{sfn|Banner|1974|p=35}} Wilkinson also received advances on his salary and payments on claims submitted to Secretary of War [[Henry Dearborn]]. This damaging information apparently was unknown to Jefferson. In 1805, Jefferson trusted Wilkinson and appointed him Louisiana Territory governor, admiring Wilkinson's work ethic.

In January 1806, Jefferson received information from Kentucky U.S. Attorney Joseph Davies that Wilkinson was on the Spanish payroll. Jefferson took no action against Wilkinson, since there was not then significant evidence against him.{{sfn|Banner|1974|pp=35–36}} An investigation by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in December 1807 exonerated Wilkinson.{{sfn|Banner|1974|p=36}} In 1808, a military court looked into the allegations against Wilkinson but also found a lack of evidence. Jefferson retained Wilkinson in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].{{sfn|Banner|1974|pp=36–37}} Evidence found in Spanish archives in the 20th century proved Wilkinson was on the Spanish payroll.{{sfn|Banner|1974|p=35}}

===Foreign affairs (1805–1809)===

====Attempted annexation of Florida====
In the aftermath of the [[Louisiana Purchase]], Jefferson attempted to annex [[Spanish West Florida|West Florida]] from Spain. In his annual message to Congress, on December 3, 1805, Jefferson railed against Spain over Florida border depredations.{{sfn|Banner|1974|pp=37–38}}<ref name=Peterson2002p49>[[#Peterson2002|Peterson, 2002]], p. 49.</ref> A few days later Jefferson secretly requested a two-million-dollar expenditure to purchase Florida. Floor leader [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] opposed annexation and was upset over Jefferson's secrecy on the matter, and believed the money would land in the [[coffers]] of Napoleon.{{sfn|Banner|1974|p=38}}<ref name=Peterson2002p49/> The Two Million Dollar bill passed only after Jefferson successfully maneuvered to replace Randolph with [[Barnabas Bidwell]] as floor leader.{{sfn|Banner|1974|p=38}}<ref name=Peterson2002p49/> This aroused suspicion of Jefferson and charges of undue executive influence over Congress. Jefferson signed the bill into law in February 1806. Six weeks later the law was made public. The two million dollars was to be given to France as payment, in turn, to put pressure on Spain to permit the annexation of Florida by the United States. France, however, refused the offer and Florida remained under Spanish control.{{sfn|Banner|1974|pp=38–39}}<ref name=Peterson2002p49/> The failed venture damaged Jefferson's reputation among his supporters.{{sfn|Banner|1974|p=39}}<ref name=Peterson2002p49/>

====''Chesapeake''–''Leopard'' affair====
{{Main|Chesapeake–Leopard affair}}
[[File:Leopardchesapeake.jpg|thumb|An illustration of [[HMS Leopard|HMS ''Leopard'']] (right) firing upon the [[USS Chesapeake|USS ''Chesapeake'']] in June 1807]]

The British conducted seizures of American shipping to search for British deserters from 1806 to 1807; American citizens were thus impressed into the British naval service. In 1806, Jefferson issued a call for a boycott of British goods; on April 18, Congress passed the Non-Importation Acts, but they were never enforced. Later that year, Jefferson asked James Monroe and [[William Pinkney]] to negotiate an end to the harassment of American shipping, though Britain showed no signs of improving relations. The [[Monroe–Pinkney Treaty]] was finalized but lacked any provisions to end the British policies, and Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification.<ref name=Hayes505>[[#Hayes|Hayes, 2008]], pp. 504–505.</ref>

The British ship {{HMS|Leopard|1790|6}} fired upon the {{USS|Chesapeake|1799|6}} off the Virginia coast in June 1807.<ref name=embargo>[[#TJFEmbargo|TJF: Embargo of 1807]]</ref> Jefferson issued a proclamation banning armed British ships from U.S. waters. He presumed unilateral authority to call on the states to prepare 100,000 militia and ordered the purchase of arms, ammunition, and supplies, writing, "The laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher obligation [than strict observance of written laws]". The {{USS|Revenge|1806|6}} was dispatched to demand an explanation from the British government; it also was fired upon. Jefferson called for a special session of Congress in October to enact an embargo or alternatively to consider war.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 425–429.</ref>

====Embargo (1807–1809)====
{{further|Embargo Act of 1807}}
[[File:Ograbme.jpg|thumb|alt=A turtle biting a man carrying a barrel to a waiting ship|An 1807 political cartoon on the [[Embargo Act of 1807|Embargo Act]], depicting merchants dodging the "Ograbme", which is "Embargo" spelled backward]]

In December 1807, news arrived that Napoleon had extended the [[Berlin Decree]], globally banning British imports. In Britain, King [[George III]] ordered redoubling efforts at impressment, including American sailors. But Congress had no appetite to prepare the U.S. for war. Jefferson asked for and received the Embargo Act, an alternative that allowed the U.S. more time to build up defensive works, militias, and naval forces. Meacham said that the [[Embargo Act of 1807|Embargo Act]] was a projection of power that surpassed the Alien and Sedition Acts, and R. B. Bernstein said that Jefferson "was pursuing policies resembling those he had cited in 1776 as grounds for independence and revolution".<ref>[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 168; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 430.</ref>

In November 1807, Jefferson, for several days, met with his cabinet to discuss the deteriorating foreign situation.<ref>[[#Peterson2002|Peterson, 2002]], pp. 52–53</ref> Secretary of State James Madison supported the embargo,<ref>[[#Burstein10|Burstein, 2010]], pp. 497–498.</ref> while Treasury Secretary Gallatin opposed it, due to its indefinite time frame and the risk to the policy of American neutrality.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 430.</ref> The U.S. economy suffered, criticism grew, and opponents began evading the embargo. Instead of retreating, Jefferson sent federal agents to secretly track down smugglers and violators.<ref>[[#Tucker90|Tucker, 1990]], v. 1, pp. 204–209, 232.</ref> Three acts were passed in Congress during 1807 and 1808, called the ''Supplementary'', the ''Additional'', and the ''Enforcement'' acts.<ref name=embargo/> The government could not prevent American vessels from trading with the European belligerents once they had left American ports, although the embargo triggered a devastating decline in exports.<ref name=embargo/>

In December 1807, Jefferson announced his intention not to seek a third term. He turned his attention increasingly to Monticello during the last year of his presidency, giving Madison and Gallatin almost total control of affairs.<ref>[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], p. 238; [[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], pp. 128–129.</ref> Shortly before leaving office in March 1809, Jefferson signed the repeal of the Embargo. In its place, the [[Non-Intercourse Act]] was passed, but it proved no more effective.<ref name=embargo/> The day before Madison was inaugurated as his successor, Jefferson said that he felt like "a prisoner, released from his chains".<ref>[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], p. 238.</ref>

==Post-presidency (1809–1826)==
{{further|Thomas Jefferson and education}}

After his presidency, Jefferson remained influential and continued to correspond with many of the country's leaders (including his two protégées, Madison and Monroe, who succeeded him as president); the [[Monroe Doctrine]] strongly resembles solicited advice that Jefferson gave to Monroe in 1823.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 481–482.</ref><ref>[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], p. 232; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 463–465.</ref>

===University of Virginia===
{{Main|University of Virginia}}
[[File:Lawn UVa Rotunda Pavilions II and IV.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Virginia]] in Charlottesville, founded by Jefferson in 1819]]

Jefferson envisioned a university free of church influences where students could specialize in new areas not offered at other colleges. He believed that education engendered a stable society, which should provide publicly funded schools accessible based solely on ability.<ref>[[#UVALibrary|U Va. Library]]</ref> He initially proposed his university in a letter to [[Joseph Priestley]] in 1800<ref>[[#Adams88|Adams, 1888]], p. 48.</ref> and, in 1819, founded the [[University of Virginia]]. He organized the state legislative campaign for its charter and, with the assistance of [[Edmund Bacon (1785–1866)|Edmund Bacon]], purchased the location. He was the principal designer of the buildings, planned the university's curriculum, and served as the first rector upon its opening in 1825.<ref name="Peterson 1970 ch11">[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], ch. 11 [e-book].</ref>

Jefferson was a strong disciple of Greek and Roman architectural styles, which he believed to be most representative of American democracy. Each academic unit, called a pavilion, was designed with a two-story temple front, while the library "Rotunda" was modeled on the [[Pantheon, Rome|Roman Pantheon]]. Jefferson referred to the university's grounds as the "[[The Lawn|Academical Village]]", and he reflected his educational ideas in its layout. The ten pavilions included classrooms and faculty residences; they formed a quadrangle and were connected by colonnades, behind which stood the student rooms. Gardens and vegetable plots were placed behind the pavilions and were surrounded by [[Crinkle crankle wall|serpentine walls]], affirming the importance of the agrarian lifestyle.<ref>[[#Hogan87|Hogan, 1987]], pp. 28–29.</ref> The university had a library rather than a church at its center, emphasizing its secular nature—controversial at the time.<ref>[[#Gordon08|Gordon-Reed, 2008]], p. 649.</ref>

When Jefferson died in 1826, James Madison replaced him as rector.<ref>[[#TJFMadison|TJF: James Madison]]</ref> Jefferson bequeathed most of his reconstructed library of almost 2,000 volumes to the university.<ref>[[#Crawford2008|Crawford, 2008]], p. 235.</ref> Only one other ex-president has founded a university; [[Millard Fillmore]] founded the [[University at Buffalo]] in 1846.<ref>{{cite web |title=Millard Fillmore |url=https://www.buffalo.edu/news/key-issues/Millard-Fillmore.html |website=University Of Buffalo |access-date=November 24, 2022}}</ref>

===Reconciliation with Adams===
[[File:Gilbert Stuart, Abigail Smith Adams (Mrs. John Adams), 1800-1815, NGA 42934.jpg|thumb|In 1804, [[Abigail Adams]], wife and confidant of John Adams, was one of several people who intervened in an attempt to reconcile differences between Jefferson and John Adams. Jefferson and Adams ultimately reconciled, established a lengthy correspondence and renewed friendship, and died within hours of each other on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.]]

Jefferson and [[John Adams]] became good friends in the first decades of their political careers, serving together in the Continental Congress in the 1770s and in Europe in the 1780s. The Federalist/Republican split of the 1790s divided them, however, and Adams felt betrayed by Jefferson's sponsorship of partisan attacks, such as those of James Callender. Jefferson was angered by Adams' appointment of "midnight judges".<ref name=Freeman2008>[[#Freeman1|Freeman, 2008]], p.  12.</ref> The two men did not communicate directly for more than a decade after Jefferson succeeded Adams as president.<ref>[[#Ellis03|Ellis, 2003]], pp. 207, 209.</ref> A brief correspondence took place between [[Abigail Adams]] and Jefferson after Jefferson's daughter Polly died in 1804, in an attempt at reconciliation unknown to Adams. However, an exchange of letters resumed open hostilities between Adams and Jefferson.<ref name=Freeman2008/>

As early as 1809, [[Benjamin Rush]] began to prod the two through correspondence to re-establish contact.<ref name=Freeman2008/> In 1812, Adams wrote a short New Year's greeting to Jefferson, prompted earlier by Rush, to which Jefferson warmly responded. This initial correspondence began what historian [[David McCullough]] calls "one of the most extraordinary correspondences in American history".<ref>[[#McCullough|McCullough, 2001]], pp. 603–605.</ref> Over the next 14 years, Jefferson and Adams exchanged 158 letters discussing their political differences, justifying their respective roles in events, and debating the revolution's import to the world.<ref>[[#Ellis03|Ellis, 2003]], pp. 213, 230.</ref>

When Adams died on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, his last words were an acknowledgment of his longtime friend and rival. "Thomas Jefferson survives", Adams said, unaware that Jefferson had died a few hours earlier.<ref>[[#McCullough|McCullough, 2001]], p. 646.</ref><ref>[[#Ellis03|Ellis, 2003]], p. 248.</ref><ref>[https://blogs.loc.gov/headlinesandheroes/2022/07/deaths-of-john-adams-and-thomas-jefferson-on-july-4th/ "Deaths of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson on July 4th"], Library of Congress, July 6, 2022</ref>

===Autobiography===
In 1821, at the age of 77, Jefferson began writing his ''Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson: 1743–1790'', in which he said he sought to "state some recollections of dates and facts concerning myself".<ref name=Jeffbio>[[#Bio|Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson, 1743–1790]]</ref> He focused on the struggles and achievements he experienced until July 29, 1790, where the narrative stopped short.<ref>[[#Bernstein03|Berstein, 2003]], p. 179.</ref> He excluded his youth, emphasizing the revolutionary era. He related that his ancestors came from Wales to America in the early 17th century and settled in the western frontier of the Virginia colony, which influenced his zeal for individual and state rights. Jefferson described his father as uneducated, but with a "strong mind and sound judgement". He also addressed his enrollment in the College of William and Mary and his election to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1775.<ref name=Jeffbio/>

He expressed opposition to the idea of a privileged [[aristocracy]] made up of large landowning families partial to the King, and instead promoted "the aristocracy of virtue and talent, which nature has wisely provided for the direction of the interests of society, & scattered with equal hand through all its conditions, was deemed essential to a well-ordered republic".<ref name=Jeffbio/> The work is primarily concerned with the Declaration and reforming the government of Virginia. He used notes, letters, and documents to tell many of the stories. He suggested that this history was so rich that his personal affairs were better overlooked, but he incorporated a self-analysis using the Declaration and other patriotism.<ref>[[#self|Hamelman, 2002, Journal]]</ref>

===Greek War of Independence===
Thomas Jefferson was a [[Philhellenism|philhellene]], lover of Greek culture, who sympathized with the [[Greek War of Independence]].{{sfn|Kaufman|Macpherson|2005|p=427}}{{sfn|Jacavone|2017|p=17}} He has been described as the most influential of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] who supported the Greek cause,{{sfn|Jacavone|2017|p=17}}{{sfn|Earle|1927|p=49}} viewing it as similar to the [[American Revolution]].{{sfn|Jacavone|2017|p=29}} By 1823, Jefferson was exchanging ideas with Greek scholar [[Adamantios Korais]].{{sfn|Jacavone|2017|p=17}} Jefferson advised Korais on building the political system of [[Greece]] by using [[classical liberalism]] and examples from the American governmental system, ultimately prescribing a government akin to that of a U.S. state.{{sfn|Jacavone|2017|p=18}} He also suggested the application of a [[classical education movement|classical education system]] for the newly founded [[First Hellenic Republic]].{{sfn|Jacavone|2017|p=19}} Jefferson's philosophical instructions were welcomed by the [[Greek people]].{{sfn|Jacavone|2017|p=19}} Korais became one of the designers of the [[Greek constitution]] and urged his associates to study Jefferson's works and other literature from the American Revolution.{{sfn|Jacavone|2017|p=19}}

In the summer of 1824, the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] accepted an invitation from President [[James Monroe]] to visit the country. Jefferson and Lafayette had not seen each other since 1789. After visits to New York, [[New England]], and Washington, Lafayette arrived at [[Monticello]] on November 4.<ref name="Peterson 1970 ch11"/>

Jefferson's grandson [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph|Randolph]] was present and recorded the reunion: "As they approached each other, their uncertain gait quickened itself into a shuffling run, and exclaiming, 'Ah Jefferson!' 'Ah Lafayette!', they burst into tears as they fell into each other's arms." Jefferson and Lafayette then retired to the house to reminisce.<ref>[[#Mapp|Mapp, 1991]], p. 328.</ref> The next morning Jefferson, Lafayette, and James Madison attended a tour and banquet at the University of Virginia. Jefferson had someone else read a speech he had prepared for Lafayette, as his voice was weak and could not carry. This was his last public presentation. After an 11-day visit, Lafayette bid Jefferson goodbye and departed Monticello.<ref>[[#Malone81|Malone, 1981]], pp. 403–404; [[#Brodie|Brodie, 1998]], p. 460; [[#Crawford2008|Crawford, 2008]], pp. 202–203.</ref>

Jefferson's approximately $100,000 of debt weighed heavily on his mind in his final months,{{Citation needed|reason=Directly contradicts daughter's statement that "he died tranquil", expecting a lottery to save the day [396].|date=September 2024}} as it became increasingly clear that he would have little to leave to his heirs.

{{anchor|Death}}
During his last hours, he was accompanied by family members and friends. Jefferson died on July 4, 1826, at 12:50&nbsp;p.m. at age 83, on the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. In the moments prior to his death, Jefferson instructed his treating physician, "No, doctor, nothing more", refusing [[laudanum]]. But his final significant words were, "Is it the Fourth?" or "This is the Fourth".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/jeffersons-last-words|title=Jefferson's Last Words|last=Martin|first=Russell L.|date=June 7, 1988|website=Monticello|access-date=February 2, 2019}}</ref> When [[John Adams]] died later that same day, his last words were "Thomas Jefferson survives", though Adams was unaware that Jefferson had died several hours before.<ref>[[#McCullough|McCullough, 2001]], p. 646</ref><ref>[[#Ellis03|Ellis, 2003]], p. 248</ref><ref name="rayner428–29">[[#Rayner34|Rayner, 1834]], pp. 428–429.</ref><ref name=Berstein189>[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 189.</ref> The sitting president was Adams's son, [[John Quincy Adams]], and he called the coincidence of their deaths on the nation's anniversary "visible and palpable remarks of Divine Favor".<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 496.</ref>

Shortly after Jefferson died, attendants found a gold locket on a chain around his neck, containing a small faded blue ribbon around a lock of his wife [[Martha Jefferson|Martha]]'s hair.<ref>[[#Donaldson|Donaldson, 1898]], p. 49.</ref>

Jefferson was interred at [[Monticello]], under an [[epitaph]] that he wrote:

<blockquote>HERE WAS BURIED THOMAS JEFFERSON, AUTHOR OF THE DECLARATION OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE, OF THE STATUTE OF VIRGINIA FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND FATHER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.<ref>[[#TJFBio|Thomas Jefferson Foundation: "Thomas Jefferson, A Brief Biography"]]</ref></blockquote>

In his advanced years, Jefferson became increasingly concerned that people would understand the principles in the Declaration of Independence, and the people responsible for writing it, and he continually defended himself as its author. He considered the document one of his greatest life achievements, in addition to authoring the [[Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom]] and founding the [[University of Virginia]]. Absent from his epitaph were his political roles, including his presidency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/jeffleg.html|title=Legacy: Thomas Jefferson|website=Library of Congress.gov|access-date=June 15, 2019|date=April 24, 2000}}</ref>

==Political, social, and religious views==
{{republicanism sidebar}}
Jefferson subscribed to the political ideals expounded by [[John Locke]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton]], whom he considered the three greatest men who ever lived.<ref name="Hayes, 2008, p. 10">[[#Kayes|Hayes, 2008]], p. 10.</ref><ref name="Cogliano p. 14">[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2008]], p. 14.</ref> He was also influenced by the writings of [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[William Robertson (historian)|Robertson]], [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]], [[Montesquieu]], and [[Voltaire]].<ref name="Cogliano p. 26">[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2008]], p. 26.</ref> Jefferson thought that the independent [[Yeoman#United States|yeoman]] and agrarian life were ideals of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican virtues]]. He distrusted cities and financiers, favored decentralized government power, and believed that the tyranny that had plagued the common man in Europe was due to corrupt political establishments and monarchies. He supported efforts to disestablish the [[Church of England]],<ref>[[#Ferling2000|Ferling, 2000]], p. 158.</ref> wrote the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], and he pressed for a [[Separation of church and state in the United States|wall of separation]] between church and state.<ref>[[#Mayer2|Mayer, 1994]], p. 76.</ref> The Republicans under Jefferson were strongly influenced by the 18th-century British [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]], which believed in [[limited government]].<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 287.</ref> His [[Democratic-Republican Party]] became dominant in [[First Party System|early American politics]], and his views became known as [[Jeffersonian democracy]].<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, pp. 559–567.</ref><ref name=Smith2003_p_314>[[#Smith2003|Smith, 2003]], p. 314.</ref>

===Philosophy, society, and government===
Jefferson wrote letters and speeches prolifically; these show him to be well-read in the philosophical literature of his day and of antiquity. Nevertheless, some scholars do not take Jefferson seriously as a philosopher mainly because he did not produce a formal work on philosophy. However, he has been described as one of the most outstanding philosophical figures of his time because his work provided the theoretical background to, and the substance of, the social and political events of the revolutionary years and the development of the [[American Constitution]] in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Marsoobian |first1=Armen T. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBUnSuDT9ccC&pg=PA4 |title=The Blackwell Guide to American Philosophy |last2=Ryder |first2=John |date=2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-4051-4296-0 |pages=4 |language=en}}</ref> Jefferson continued to attend to more theoretical questions of [[natural philosophy]] and subsequently left behind a rich philosophical legacy in the form of presidential messages, letters, and public papers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas Jefferson|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jefferson/ |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=December 16, 2019|access-date=June 17, 2022}}</ref>

Jefferson described himself as an [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] and, although he adopted the Stoic belief in [[intuition]] and found comfort in the Stoic emphasis on the patient endurance of misfortune, he rejected most aspects of [[Stoicism]] with the notable exception of [[Epictetus]]' works.{{Close paraphrasing inline|date=March 2024}}<ref>Letter: Thomas Jefferson to William Short, Monticello, October 31, 1819</ref><ref name="Richard">{{Cite book |last=Richard |first=Carl J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VV_caPJhT6AC&pg=PA94 |title=The Battle for the American Mind: A Brief History of a Nation's Thought |date=2006 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-3436-0 |pages=94 |language=en}}</ref> He rejected the Stoics' doctrine of a [[Soul#Philosophical views|separable soul]] and their [[fatalism]], and was angered by their misrepresentation of Epicureanism as mere hedonism.{{Close paraphrasing inline|date=March 2024}}<ref name="Richard" /> Jefferson knew Epicurean philosophy from original sources, but also mentioned [[Pierre Gassendi]]'s ''[[Pierre Gassendi#Syntagma philosophicum|Syntagma philosophicum]]'' as influencing his ideas on Epicureanism.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sanford |first=Charles B. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BMzIavSRNdEC&pg=PA39 |title=The Religious Life of Thomas Jefferson |date=1984 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |isbn=978-0-8139-1131-1 |pages=39 |language=en}}</ref>

According to Jefferson's philosophy, citizens have "certain inalienable rights" and "rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will, within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others."<ref>[[#Bassani|Bassani, 2010]], p. 113.</ref><ref>[[#De Witte (2020)|De Witte, 2020]]</ref>  A staunch advocate of the jury system, he proclaimed in 1801, "I consider [trial by jury] as the only anchor yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution."<ref>[[#Wilson2012|Wilson, 2012]], p. 584.</ref> Jeffersonian government not only prohibited individuals in society from infringing on the liberty of others, but also restrained itself from diminishing [[individual liberty]] as a protection against [[tyranny of the majority]].<ref>[[#Mayer2|Mayer, 1994]], p. 328.</ref> Initially, Jefferson favored restricted voting to those who could actually have the free exercise of their reason by escaping any corrupting dependence on others. He advocated enfranchising a majority of Virginians, seeking to expand suffrage to include "yeoman farmers" who owned their own land while excluding tenant farmers, city day laborers, vagrants, most American Indians, and women.<ref name=Wood220/>

He was convinced that individual liberties were the fruit of political equality, which was threatened by the arbitrary government.<ref>[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]], p. 340.</ref> Excesses of democracy in his view were caused by institutional corruption rather than human nature. He was less suspicious of a working democracy than many contemporaries.<ref name=Wood220>[[#Wood2011|Wood, 2011]], pp. 220–227.</ref> As president, Jefferson feared that the [[Federalism in the United States|federal system]] enacted by Washington and Adams had encouraged corrupting patronage and dependence. He tried to restore a balance between the state and federal governments more nearly reflecting the [[Articles of Confederation]], seeking to reinforce state prerogatives where his party was in the majority.<ref name=Wood220/>

According to Stanford Scholar [[Jack N. Rakove|Jack Rakove]], "[w]hen Jefferson wrote “all men are created equal” in the preamble to the Declaration, he was not talking about individual equality. What he really meant was that the American colonists, as a people, had the same rights of self-government as other peoples, and hence could declare independence, create new governments and assume their “separate and equal station” among other nations."<ref>[[#De Witte (2020)|De Witte, 2020]]</ref> Jefferson's famous mantra later became a statement "of individual equality that everyone and every member of a deprived group could claim for himself or herself."<ref>[[#De Witte (2020)|De Witte, 2020]]</ref> Historian [[Henry Wiencek]] has noted Jefferson included slaves when he penned "''all men are created equal''" in the Declaration. As early as 1774, Jefferson had supported ending domestic slavery, and making slaves citizens.<ref>[[#Wiencek12|Wiencek, 2012]], pp. 25-27</ref> Later, writing in ''Notes'' (1781), Jefferson supported gradual emancipation of slaves, to be sent away from the U.S. to an unspecified place. The former slaves would be replaced by white immigrant workers. <ref>[[#Wiencek12|Wiencek, 2012]], pp. 53-54</ref> In 1792, Jefferson calculated that he was making a 4 percent profit every year on the birth of black children. After this he wrote that slavery presented an investment strategy for the future. Historian Brion Davis writes that Jefferson's emancipation efforts virtually ceased.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-dark-side-of-thomas-jefferson-35976004/|last=Wiencek|first=Henry|title=The Dark Side of Thomas Jefferson|website=Smithsonian Magazine|date=October 2012}}</ref>

Jefferson was steeped in the [[Whiggism|Whig tradition]] of the oppressed majority set against a repeatedly unresponsive court party in the Parliament. He justified small outbreaks of rebellion as necessary to get monarchial regimes to amend oppressive measures compromising popular liberties. In a republican regime ruled by the majority, he acknowledged "it will often be exercised when wrong".<ref>[[#Golden|Golden & Golden, 2002]], p. 60.</ref> But "the remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them".<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 213. The full letter to [[William Stephens Smith|William S. Smith]] can be seen [https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/jefffed.html at the Library of Congress]</ref> As Jefferson saw his party triumph in two terms of his presidency and launch into a third term under James Madison, his view of the U.S. as a continental republic and an "empire of liberty" grew more upbeat. On departing the presidency, he described America as "trusted with the destines of this solitary republic of the world, the only monument of human rights, and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government".<ref>[[#Bober|Bober, 2008]], p. 264.</ref>

Jefferson was a supporter of [[American expansionism]], writing in 1801 that "it is impossible not to look forward to distant times when our rapid multiplication will expand itself beyond those limits, and cover the whole northern, if not the southern continent."<ref>{{cite book |title=Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History A Reinterpretation |date=1995 |publisher = Harvard University Press |page=9}}</ref>

===Democracy===
[[File:Jefferson Portrait West Point by Thomas Sully.jpg|thumb|alt=Elder Jefferson|Jefferson, at age 78, depicted in an 1821 [[Thomas Sully]] portrait]]

Jefferson considered democracy to be the expression of society and promoted national self-determination, cultural uniformity, and education of all males of the commonwealth.<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 277.</ref> He supported public education and a free press as essential components of a democratic nation.<ref>[[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], pp. 57–58, 84.</ref>

After resigning as [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] in 1795, Jefferson focused on the electoral bases of the Republicans and Federalists. The "Republican" classification for which he advocated included "the entire body of landholders" everywhere and "the body of laborers" without land.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 298.</ref> Republicans united behind Jefferson as vice president, with the election of 1796 expanding democracy nationwide at grassroots levels.<ref>[[#Wilentz|Wilentz, 2005]], p. 85.</ref> Jefferson promoted Republican candidates for local offices.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 308.</ref>

Beginning with Jefferson's electioneering for the "revolution of 1800", his political efforts were based on egalitarian appeals.<ref>[[#Wilentz|Wilentz, 2005]], pp. 97–98.</ref> In his later years, he referred to the 1800 election "as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of '76 was in its form", one "not effected indeed by the sword&nbsp;... but by the&nbsp;... suffrage of the people".<ref>[[#Wilentz|Wilentz, 2005]], p. 97.</ref> Voter participation grew during Jefferson's presidency, increasing to "unimaginable levels" compared to the Federalist Era, with turnout of about 67,000 in [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]] rising to about 143,000 in [[1804 United States presidential election|1804]].<ref>[[#Wilentz|Wilentz, 2005]], p. 138.</ref>

At the onset of the [[American Revolution]], Jefferson accepted [[William Blackstone]]'s argument that property ownership would sufficiently empower voters' independent judgement, but he sought to further expand suffrage by land distribution to the poor.<ref>[[#Keyssar|Keyssar, 2009]], p. 10.</ref> In the heat of the Revolutionary Era and afterward, several states expanded voter eligibility from landed gentry to all propertied male, tax-paying citizens with Jefferson's support.<ref>[[#Ferling04|Ferling, 2004]], p. 286.</ref> In retirement, he gradually became critical of his home state for violating "the principle of equal political rights"—the social right of universal male suffrage.<ref>[[#Keyssar|Keyssar, 2009]], p. 37.</ref> He sought a "general suffrage" of all taxpayers and militia-men, and equal representation by population in the General Assembly to correct preferential treatment of the slave-holding regions.<ref>[[#Wilentz|Wilentz, 2005]], p. 200.</ref>

===Religion===

Baptized in his youth, Jefferson became a governing member of his local [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], which he later attended with his daughters.<ref>[[#Randall|Randall, 1994]], p. 203.</ref> Jefferson, however, spurned Biblical views of Christianity.<ref name="Cunningham 2020">[[#Cunningham (December 28, 2020)|Cunningham (December 28, 2020)]]</ref> Influenced by [[Deism|Deist]] authors during his college years, Jefferson abandoned orthodox Christianity after his review of [[New Testament]] teachings.<ref>[[#TJFReligion|TJF: "Jefferson's Religious Beliefs"]]</ref><ref>[[#Onuf07|Onuf, 2007]], pp. 139–168.</ref> Jefferson has sometimes been portrayed as a follower of the liberal religious strand of Deism that values reason over revelation.<ref name=":1a">{{Cite web |title=People and Ideas: Early America's Formation |url=http://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/people/thomas-jefferson.html |access-date=April 30, 2022 |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |language=en |quote=Like other Founding Fathers, Jefferson was considered a Deist, subscribing to the liberal religious strand of Deism that values reason over revelation and rejects traditional Christian doctrines, including the Virgin Birth, original sin and the resurrection of Jesus. While he rejected orthodoxy, Jefferson was nevertheless a religious man. [...] Influenced by the British Unitarian Joseph Priestley, Jefferson set his prodigious intellect and energy on the historical figure at the center of the Christian faith: Jesus of Nazareth. Jefferson became convinced that Jesus' message had been obscured and corrupted by the apostle Paul, the Gospel writers and Protestant reformers.}}</ref> Nonetheless, in 1803, Jefferson asserted, "I am Christian, in the only sense in which [Jesus] wished any one to be".<ref name="Randal583"/>

Jefferson later defined being a Christian as one who followed the simple teachings of Jesus. Influenced by [[Joseph Priestley]],<ref name=":1a" /> Jefferson selected New Testament passages of Jesus' teachings into a private work he called ''The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth'', known today as the ''[[Jefferson Bible]]'', which was never published during his lifetime.<ref name="Jefferson Bible, 1820">[[#Jesus|Jefferson Bible, 1820]]</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">[[#Religion|Thomas Jefferson's Religion]]</ref> Jefferson believed that Jesus' message had been obscured and corrupted by [[Paul the Apostle]], the [[Four Evangelists|Gospel writers]] and [[Protestant Reformers|Protestant reformers]].<ref name=":1a" /> Peterson states that Jefferson was a [[Theism|theist]] "whose God was the Creator of the universe&nbsp;... all the evidences of nature testified to His perfection; and man could rely on the harmony and beneficence of His work".<ref>[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], ch. 2 [e-book].</ref> In a letter to [[John Adams]], Jefferson wrote that what he believed was genuinely Christ's, found in the Gospels, was "as easily distinguishable as diamonds in a dunghill".<ref name="Cunningham 2020"/> By omitting miracles and the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], Jefferson made the figure of Jesus more compatible with a worldview based on reason.<ref name="Cunningham 2020"/>

Jefferson was firmly [[Anti-clericalism|anticlerical]], writing in "every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty&nbsp;... they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon."<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 577.</ref> The full letter to Horatio Spatford can be read at the National Archives.<ref>[[#archives|U.S. Gov: National Archives]]</ref> Jefferson once supported banning clergy from public office but later relented.<ref>[[#Finkelman2006|Finkelman, 2006]], p. 921.</ref> In 1777, he drafted the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]]. Ratified in 1786, it made compelling attendance or contributions to any state-sanctioned religious establishment illegal and declared that men "shall be free to profess&nbsp;... their opinions in matters of religion".<ref>[[#Yarbrough2006|Yarbrough, 2006]], p. 28.</ref> The Statute is one of only three accomplishments he chose for his epitaph.<ref>[[#Peterson|Peterson, 2003]], p. 315.</ref><ref>W. W. Hening, ed., Statutes at Large of Virginia, vol. 12 (1823): 84–86.</ref> Early in 1802, Jefferson wrote to the Danbury Connecticut Baptist Association that "religion is a matter which lies solely between Man and his God". He interpreted the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as having built "a wall of [[Separation of church and state|separation between Church and State]]".<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 369–370.</ref> The phrase 'Separation of Church and State' has been cited several times by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in its interpretation of the [[Establishment Clause]].

Jefferson donated to the [[American Bible Society]], saying the [[Four Evangelists]] delivered a "pure and sublime system of morality" to humanity. He thought Americans would rationally create "[[Beekeeping|Apiarian]]" religion, extracting the best traditions of every denomination.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 472–473.</ref> He contributed generously to several local denominations near Monticello.<ref>[[#Randall|Randall, 1994]], p. 555.</ref> Acknowledging [[organized religion]] would always be factored into political life, he encouraged reason over supernatural revelation to make inquiries into religion. He believed in a [[Creator deity|creator god]], an [[afterlife]], and the sum of religion as loving God and neighbors. But he also controversially rejected fundamental Christian beliefs, denying the conventional Christian [[Trinity]], Jesus's divinity as the [[Son of God]] and miracles, the Resurrection of Christ, atonement from sin, and [[original sin]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 471–473.</ref><ref>[[#CITEREFSanford1984|Sanford, 1984]], pp. 85–86.</ref> Jefferson believed that original sin was a gross injustice.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Jefferson's unorthodox religious beliefs became an important issue in the [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 presidential election]].<ref name=Wood586>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 586.</ref> Federalists attacked him as an [[atheist]]. As president, Jefferson countered the accusations by praising religion in his inaugural address and attending services at the Capitol.<ref name=Wood586/>

===Banks===
[[File:Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806.jpg|thumb|Jefferson opposed Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s proposal to establish a government bank, and the two emerged as political rivals during [[George Washington's presidency]].]]

Jefferson distrusted government banks and opposed public borrowing, which he thought created long-term debt, bred monopolies, and invited dangerous speculation as opposed to productive labor.<ref>[[#Malone81|Malone, 1981]], pp. 140–143.</ref> In one letter to Madison, he argued each generation should curtail all debt within 19 years, and not impose a long-term debt on subsequent generations.<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 224–225.</ref>

In 1791, President Washington asked Jefferson, then secretary of state, and Hamilton, the secretary of the treasury, if the Congress had the authority to create a [[First Bank of the United States|national bank]]. While Hamilton believed so, Jefferson and Madison thought a national bank would ignore the needs of individuals and farmers, and would violate the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] by assuming powers not granted to the federal government by the states.<ref>[[#Bailey2007|Bailey, 2007]], p. 82; [[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 144; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 249.</ref> Hamilton successfully argued that the [[implied powers]] given to the federal government in the Constitution supported the creation of a national bank, among other federal actions.

Jefferson used agrarian resistance to banks and speculators as the first defining principle of an opposition party, recruiting candidates for Congress on the issue as early as 1792.<ref>[[#Ferling13|Ferling, 2013]], pp. 221–222.</ref> As president, Jefferson was persuaded by Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin to leave the bank intact but sought to restrain its influence.<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 293–295.</ref>{{efn|The First Bank of the U.S. was eventually abolished in 1811 by a heavily Republican Congress.<ref>[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 295–296.</ref>}}

===Slavery===
{{Main|Thomas Jefferson and slavery}}
[[File:Jefferson slaves.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Farm Book page|Page 30 of Jefferson's 1795 Farm Book lists 163 slaves at Monticello.]]

Scholars give radically differing interpretations on [[Thomas Jefferson and slavery|Jefferson's views and relationship with slavery]].<ref name=":1" /> Opinions range from "emancipationists" who view him as an early [[Abolitionism|proto-abolitionist]], who subsequently made pragmatic compromises with the [[Slave Power|slave power]] to [[Secession in the United States|preserve the union]]; to "[[Historical revisionism|revisionists]]", who argue that he in fact entrenched the institution in American society; with people also having more nuanced opinions, who either argue that Jefferson held inconsistent views on the institution throughout his lifetime or that both interpretations are too overly simplistic.<ref name=":1" />

Jefferson lived in a planter economy largely dependent upon slavery, and as a wealthy landholder, used slave labor for his household, plantation, and workshops.

Claims that Jefferson fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings after his wife's death have been debated since 1802. In that year [[James T. Callender]], after being denied a position as [[postmaster]], alleged Jefferson had taken Hemings as a concubine and fathered several children with her.<ref>In 1853, [[William Wells Brown]] published a novel called ''[[Clotel; or, The President's Daughter]]'' alluding to Jefferson.

Still, a minority of scholars maintain the evidence is insufficient to prove Jefferson's paternity conclusively.

==Interests and activities==
[[File:MJK50147 Virginia State Capitol.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Virginia State Capitol]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], which Jefferson designed]]

Jefferson was a farmer, obsessed with new crops, soil conditions, garden designs, and scientific agricultural techniques. His main cash crop was tobacco, but its price was usually low and it was rarely profitable. He tried to achieve self-sufficiency with wheat, vegetables, flax, corn, hogs, sheep, poultry, and cattle to supply his family, slaves, and employees, but he lived perpetually beyond his means<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/debt |title=Debt |work=Thomas Jefferson Foundation |access-date=October 9, 2018 }}</ref> and was always in debt.<ref>[[#Hayes|Hayes, 2008]], p. 100; [[#McEwan|McEwan, 1991]], pp. 20–39.</ref> Jefferson also planted two vineyards at Monticello and hoped to grow ''Vitis vinifera,'' the European wine grape species, to make wine, but the crop failed. His efforts were nonetheless an important contribution to the development of American viticulture.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Vineyards at Monticello |url=https://www.monticello.org/house-gardens/farms-gardens/fruit-gardens/the-vineyards/ |access-date=2024-10-25 |website=Monticello |language=en}}</ref>

Jefferson mastered architecture through [[Autodidacticism|self-study]]. His primary authority was [[Andrea Palladio]]'s 1570 ''[[The Four Books of Architecture]]'', which outlines the principles of classical design.<ref>[[#Brodie|Brodie, 1974]], pp. 87–88; [[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 9.</ref> Jefferson helped popularize the Neo-Palladian style in the United States utilizing designs for the [[Virginia State Capitol]], the University of Virginia, Monticello, and others.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, p. 202; [[#Bernstein03|Berstein, 2003]], p. 193.</ref> It has been speculated that he was inspired by the [[Château de Rastignac]] in south-west France—the plans of which he saw during his ambassadorship—to convince the architect of the White House to modify the South Portico to resemble the château.<ref name=":1b">{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Michael|title=A chateau fit for a president|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/15/opinion/15iht-edjohnson.html|access-date=July 28, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 15, 2006}}</ref>

In the field of [[archaeology]], in 1784, Jefferson, using the [[Trench|trench method]], started excavating several Native American burial mounds in [[Virginia]]. His excavations were prompted by the [[Mound Builders|"Moundbuilders" question]] and his careful methods allowed him to witness the [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] layout, the various human remains and other artifacts inside the mound. The evidence present at the site granted him enough insight to admit that he saw no reason why the ancestors of the present-day Native Americans could not have raised those mounds.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Renfrew |first1=Colin |title=Archaeology essentials: theories, methods, practice |last2=Bahn |first2=Paul G. |publisher=Thames & Hudson |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-500-29159-7 |edition=3º |pages=17–18}}</ref>

===American Philosophical Society===
Jefferson was a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] for 35 years, beginning in 1780. Through the society he advanced the [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|sciences and Enlightenment ideals]], emphasizing that knowledge of science reinforced and extended freedom.<ref name=Hayes432>[[#Hayes|Hayes, 2008]], p. 432.</ref> His ''Notes on the State of Virginia'' was written in part as a contribution to the society.<ref name=TJFAPS>[[#TJFAPS|TJF: "American Philosophical Society"]]</ref> He became the society's third president on March 3, 1797, a few months after he was elected Vice President of the United States.<ref name=TJFAPS/><ref name=Berstein118>[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 118–119.</ref> In accepting, Jefferson stated: "I feel no qualification for this distinguished post but a sincere zeal for all the objects of our institution and an ardent desire to see knowledge so disseminated through the mass of mankind that it may at length reach even the extremes of society, beggars and kings."<ref name=Hayes432/>

On March 10, 1797, Thomas Jefferson gave a lecture, later published as a paper in 1799, which reported on the skeletal remains of an extinct large sloth, which he named ''[[Megalonyx]]'', unearthed by saltpeter workers from a cave in what is now Monroe County, West Virginia.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Babcock |first=Loren E. |date=March 18, 2024 |title=Nomenclatural history of Megalonyx Jefferson, 1799 (Mammalia, Xenarthra, Pilosa, Megalonychidae) |url=https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/117999/ |journal=ZooKeys |language=en |issue=1195 |pages=297–308 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.1195.117999 |doi-access=free |pmid=38532771 |issn=1313-2970|pmc=10964019 |bibcode=2024ZooK.1195..297B }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jefferson |first=Thomas |date=1799 |title=A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1005103 |journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |volume=4 |pages=246–260 |doi=10.2307/1005103 |issn=0065-9746 |jstor=1005103}}</ref> Jefferson is considered to be a pioneer of scientific paleontology research in North America.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Simpson |first=George Gaylord |date=1942 |title=The Beginnings of Vertebrate Paleontology in North America |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/985085 |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=130–188 |jstor=985085 |issn=0003-049X}}</ref>

Jefferson served as APS president for the next eighteen years, including through both terms of his presidency.<ref name=TJFAPS/> He introduced [[Meriwether Lewis]] to the society, where various scientists tutored him in preparation for the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].<ref name=TJFAPS/><ref name="Ambrose, 1996, p. 126">[[#Ambrose|Ambrose, 1996]], p. 126.</ref> He resigned on January 20, 1815, but remained active through correspondence.<ref>[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, p. 399.</ref>

===Linguistics===
Jefferson had a lifelong interest in [[linguistics]], and could speak, read, and write in a number of languages, including French, Greek, Italian, and German. In his early years, he excelled in classical languages.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#Miller|Univ. Virginia archives: Miller Center]]</ref><ref>[[#Andresen|Andresen, 2006]], Chap. 1.</ref> Jefferson later came to regard Greek as the "perfect language" as expressed in its laws and philosophy.<ref name=Boberchap1>[[#Bober|Bober, 2008]], p. 16.</ref> While attending the College of William & Mary, he taught himself Italian.<ref name=Italy>[[#TJFItaly|TJF: Italy – Language]]</ref> Here Jefferson first became familiar with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language, studying it in a linguistic and philosophical capacity. He owned 17 volumes of Anglo-Saxon texts and grammar and later wrote an essay on the Anglo-Saxon language.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Jefferson claimed to have taught himself Spanish during his nineteen-day journey to France, using only a grammar guide and a copy of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.<ref>[[#TJFSpanish|TJF: Spanish Language]]</ref>

Linguistics played a significant role in how Jefferson modeled and expressed political and philosophical ideas. He believed that the study of ancient languages was essential in understanding the roots of modern language.<ref name=Hellen155>[[#Hellenbrand|Hellenbrand, 1990]], pp. 155–156.</ref> Jefferson criticized [[Linguistic purism in English|language purists]] and supported the introduction of neologisms to English, foreseeing the emergence of [[American English|"an American dialect"]]. He described the [[Académie Française]], a body designated to regulate the French language, as an "[[Linguistic prescription#Criticisms|endeavor to arrest the progress of their language]]".<ref name=neology>{{cite web | url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-06-02-0333 | title=Founders Online: Thomas Jefferson to John Waldo, 16 August 1813}}</ref> 

He collected and understood a number of [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|American Indian vocabularies]] and instructed Lewis and Clark to record and collect various Indian languages during their Expedition.<ref>[[#Frawley|Frawley, 2003]], p. 96.</ref> When Jefferson moved from Washington after his presidency, he took 50 Native American vocabulary lists back to Monticello along with the rest of his possessions. Somewhere along the journey, a thief stole the heavy chest, thinking it was full of valuables, but its contents were dumped into the James River when the thief discovered it was only filled with papers. Thirty years of collecting were lost, with only a few fragments rescued from the muddy banks of the river.<ref>[[#apsmuseum|American Philosophical Society, 2016: Gathering voices]]</ref>

Jefferson was not an outstanding orator and preferred to communicate through writing or remain silent if possible. Instead of delivering his [[State of the Union]] addresses himself, Jefferson wrote the annual messages and sent a representative to read them aloud in Congress. This started a tradition that continued until 1913 when President [[Woodrow Wilson]] chose to deliver his own State of the Union address.<ref>[[#TJFSpeaking|TJF: "Public speaking"]]</ref>

===Inventions===
Jefferson invented many small practical devices and improved contemporary inventions, including a revolving book-stand and a "Great Clock" powered by the gravitational pull on cannonballs. He improved the [[pedometer]], the [[polygraph (duplicating device)|polygraph]] (a device for duplicating writing),<ref>[[#cipher|Univ. Virginia archives]]</ref> and the [[moldboard plow]], an idea he never patented and gave to posterity.<ref>[[#Malone62|Malone, 1962]], pp. 213–215.</ref> Jefferson can also be credited as the creator of the [[swivel chair#Origin|swivel chair]], the first of which he created and used to write much of the Declaration of Independence.<ref>[[#Kaplan|Kaplan, 1993]], p. 315.</ref> He first opposed patents but later supported them. In 1790–1793, as Secretary of State, he was the ''ex officio'' head of the three-person patent review board. He drafted reforms of US patent law which led to him being relieved of this duty in 1793, and also drastically changed the patent system.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Martin |first1=Russell L. |title=Patents |url=https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/patents/ |publisher=Thomas Jefferson Foundation |access-date=September 20, 2022 |date=April 1989|encyclopedia=Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia}}; source also links to two related 21st-century sources</ref>

As Minister to France, Jefferson was impressed by the military standardization program known as the ''[[Gribeauval system|Système Gribeauval]]'', and initiated a program as president to develop [[interchangeable parts]] for firearms. For his inventiveness and ingenuity, he received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from [[Harvard University]].<ref>[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], pp. 335–336.</ref>

Jefferson is seen as an icon of individual liberty, democracy, and [[republicanism]], hailed as the author of the Declaration of Independence, an architect of the American Revolution, and a [[Polymath#Renaissance man|renaissance man]] who promoted science and scholarship.<ref>[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]], pp. 5, 67–69, 189–208, 340.</ref> The participatory democracy and expanded suffrage he championed defined his era and became a standard for later generations.<ref>[[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], p. 149.</ref> Meacham opined that Jefferson was the most influential figure of the democratic republic in its first half-century, succeeded by presidential adherents [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], [[Andrew Jackson]], and [[Martin Van Buren]].<ref>[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. xix.</ref> The [[Siena Research Institute]] poll of presidential scholars, begun in 1982, has consistently ranked Jefferson as one of the five best U.S. presidents,<ref>[[#Siena|SRI, 2010]].</ref> and a 2015 [[Brookings Institution]] poll of [[American Political Science Association]] members ranked him as the fifth greatest president.<ref>[[#Brookings|Brookings, 2015]]</ref>

===Memorials and honors===
{{Further|List of places named for Thomas Jefferson}}

Jefferson has been memorialized with buildings, sculptures, [[U.S. presidents on U.S. postage stamps|postage]], and [[United States dollar|currency]]. In the 1920s, Jefferson, together with [[George Washington]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]], was chosen by sculptor [[Gutzon Borglum]] and approved by President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to be depicted in a stone national memorial at [[Mount Rushmore]] in the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]].<ref name="rushmore">[[#Rushmore|NPS: Mt. Rushmore]]</ref>

The [[Jefferson Memorial]] was dedicated in Washington, D.C., in 1943, on the 200th anniversary of Jefferson's birth. The interior of the memorial includes a {{convert|19|ft|0|adj=on}} statue of Jefferson by [[Rudulph Evans]] and engravings of passages from Jefferson's writings. Most prominent among these passages are the words inscribed around the Jefferson Memorial: "I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man", a quote from Jefferson's September 23, 1800, letter to [[Benjamin Rush]].<ref>[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]], p. 378.</ref>

In October 2021, in response to lobbying, the New York City Public Design Commission voted unanimously to remove the plaster model of [[Statue of Thomas Jefferson (David d'Angers)|the statue of Jefferson]] that currently stands in the [[United States Capitol rotunda]] from the chamber of the [[New York City Council]], where it had been for more than a century, due to him fathering children with people he enslaved.<ref>{{cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Brendan |date=October 19, 2021 |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/us/thomas-jefferson-statue-be-removed-new-york-city-council-chamber-2021-10-19/ |title=Thomas Jefferson Statue to be Removed from New York City Council Chamber |work=[[Reuters]] |access-date=November 9, 2021}}</ref> The statue was taken down the next month.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/23/thomas-jefferson-statuue-new-york-city-hall |title=New York city hall removes Thomas Jefferson statue |work=The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Luscombe |date=November 23, 2021 |access-date=January 7, 2022 }}</ref>

{{s-ref|Prior to the passage of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] in 1804, each presidential elector would cast two ballots; the highest vote-getter would become president and the runner-up would become vice president. Thus, in 1796, the Democratic-Republican Party fielded Jefferson as a presidential candidate, but he came in second and therefore became vice president.}}
