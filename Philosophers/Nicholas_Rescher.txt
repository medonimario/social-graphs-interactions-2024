Peirce]] Society.<ref name="Marsonet"/> He was the founder of ''[[American Philosophical Quarterly]]'',<ref name="Cohenix">{{harvnb|Sosa|Cohen|1979|p=ix}}</ref> ''[[History of Philosophy Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Public Affairs Quarterly]]''.<ref>[[John Kekes]] (1995). "Nicholas Rescher'', [[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', p. 771.</ref> He died in Pittsburgh on January 5, 2024, at the age of 95.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.centerphilsci.pitt.edu/distinguished-university-professor-of-philosophy-professor-nick-rescher/ |title=Distinguished University Professor of Philosophy—Dr. Nicholas Rescher |publisher=The Center for Philosophy of Science, University of Pittsburgh |date=2024-01-05}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Rescher was born in [[Hagen]] in the [[Westphalia]] region of Germany.<ref name="Marsonet">{{harvnb|Marsonet}}</ref> In his autobiography he traces his descent to Nehemias Rescher (1735–1801), a founder of the Hochberg-Remseck Jewish community in Swabian Germany.<ref>Nicholas Rescher, ''Autobiography: Second Edition'', Walter de Gruyter (2010), p. 308.</ref> He relocated to the United States when he was 10 and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Rescher|1997|p=56}}</ref> In 1949 he obtained a degree in mathematics at [[Queens College, New York]],<ref name=International>{{harvnb|University of Pittsburgh|2011}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rescher|1997|p=59}}</ref> thereafter attending [[Princeton University]] and graduating with a Ph.D. in philosophy in 1951 at the age of 22, the youngest person to earn a Ph.D. in that department.<ref name=Pitt>{{harvnb|University of Pittsburgh|2014}}</ref><ref name="Marsonet"/> From 1952 to 1954 during the [[Korean War]] he served a term in the [[United States Marine Corps]], and then from 1954 to 1957 he worked for the [[Rand Corporation]]'s mathematics division.<ref name=International/> After a time at [[Lehigh University]], he taught philosophy at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] starting in 1961. The orientalist [[Oskar Rescher]] is the first cousin of his father.

==Career==
Rescher began his career as an academic at [[Princeton University]] in 1951.<ref name=International/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Princeton University|title=History - Department of Philosophy|access-date=April 4, 2014|url=http://philosophy.princeton.edu/about/history#51-52}}</ref> He joined the philosophy department at the University of Pittsburgh in 1961, becoming the first associate director of its new Center for Philosophy of Science the following year.<ref>{{harvnb|Center for Philosophy of Science|2001|pp=2–3}}</ref> In 1964, he founded the ''American Philosophical Quarterly''.<ref>{{harvnb|University of Illinois Press}}</ref> From 1980 to 1981, Rescher served as the chairman of the philosophy department.<ref name="International" /> In July 1988, Rescher changed roles at the Center for Philosophy of Science, resigning as its director and becoming its chairman.<ref>{{harvnb|Center for Philosophy of Science|2001|p=4}}</ref> In 2010, he donated his philosophy collection to the [[Hillman Library]].<ref name="International" />

An honorary member of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], he was elected to membership in the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain]], the [[Academia Europaea]], the [[Royal Society of Canada]], and the {{Interlanguage link|Institut International de Philosophie|de}}, among others.<ref name="Pitt" />

Rescher was a prolific writer, with over 100 books and 400 articles, generating the jest that Rescher is not a single person, but a committee sharing the name.<ref name="Marsonet"/><ref name="Cohenix"/><ref name=Marsonetivv/> Philosopher [[Michele Marsonet]], who has published extensively on Rescher's philosophy, writes that his prolific publication is in itself the most common objection against Rescher, adding "it is, indeed, a leitmotiv of all those unwilling to discuss his ideas".<ref name=Marsonetivv>{{harvnb|Marsonet|2008|p=iv-v}}</ref> He is known for his system of [[pragmatic idealism]], which synthesizes [[British idealism]] with the [[pragmatism]] of the U.S.<ref>{{harvnb|Jacquette|2009|p=1}}</ref>

==Philosophy==
Rescher's university biography describes his philosophical work thus:<ref name=Pitt/>
<blockquote>His work envisions a dialectical tension between our synoptic aspirations for useful knowledge and our human limitations as finite inquirers. The elaboration of this project represents a many-sided approach to fundamental philosophical issues that weaves together threads of thought from the philosophy of science, and from continental idealism and American pragmatism.</blockquote>

In the mid and late 1960s, his studies were focused on medieval Arabic logic, but he soon broadened his areas of inquiry in [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]], moving toward the [[methodological pragmatism]] he would define.<ref>{{harvnb|Jacquette|2009|p=2}}</ref> In the 1970s, he began working more extensively with American pragmatism with a focus on the writings of [[C. S. Peirce]], who was to number among his major influences.<ref>{{harvnb|Jacquette|2009|pp=3–4}}</ref> In 1966, Rescher collaborated with [[Herbert A. Simon]] on a ground-breaking paper on the theory of causality.<ref>Herbert Simon and Nicholas Rescher, "Cause and Counterfactual," ''Philosophy of Sciences'', vol. 34 (1966). pp.323-340.</ref>

Rescher had contributed to futuristics, and with [[Olaf Helmer]]<ref>Helmer, O., & Rescher, N. (1959). On the epistemology of the inexact sciences. Management science, 6(1), 25-52.</ref> and {{Interlanguage link|Norman Dalkey|sk}}, invented the [[Delphi method]] of forecasting.<ref name=Pitt/> A lifelong aficionado of the philosophy of G. W. Leibniz, Rescher has been instrumental in the reconstruction of Leibniz's ''machina deciphratoria'', an ancestor of the famous Enigma cipher machine. Rescher was also responsible for two further items of historical rediscovery and reconstruction: the model of cosmic evolution in Anaximander,<ref>2001, Robert Hahn, ''Anaximander and the Architects'' (Albany: SUNY Press).</ref> and the medieval Islamic theory of modal syllogistic.<ref>2000, Tony Street, "Toward a History of Syllogistic after Avicenna: A Note on Rescher's Studies in Arabid Modal Logic," ''Journal of Islamic Studies,'' vol. 11, pp. 209-28.</ref>

==Honors==
Rescher was honored for his work. In 1984, he received the [[Humboldt Prize]] for Humanistic Scholarship.<ref name="Marsonet"/> In 2005, he received the [[Cardinal Mercier Prize]], and in 2007 the American Catholic Philosophical Society's Aquinas Medal. In 2011, his contributions as a German-American to philosophy were recognized with the premier cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]], the Founder's Medal of the American Metaphysical Society (2016), and the Helmholtz Medal of the German Academy of Sciences [[Berlin-Brandenburg]].<ref name=Pitt/> He holds eight honorary degrees. Having held visiting lectureships at Oxford, [[University of Konstanz|Konstanz]], [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], and [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], he has been awarded fellowships by the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]], [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]], and [[National Science Foundation]]s.<ref name="Pitt" /> In April 2021, [[University of Tehran]] held a session in his honor where [[Nadia Maftouni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ettelaat.com/?p=553169|title=University of Tehran Honors Nicholas Rescher}}</ref> asserted:
<blockquote>Rescher's ''A Journey through Philosophy in 101 Anecdotes'' is a successful framework to reach a broader audience in the field. At first glance it seems an easy book to write. But at least in philosophy, it's easy to write in a complicated style and it's hard to write in a simple, clear, and readable fashion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibna.ir/fa/report/305007/%D8%AD%D8%AC%D9%85-%D9%BE%DA%98%D9%88%D9%87%D8%B4-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B9-%D8%A2%D8%AB%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%88-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1|title=Professor Maftouni Speaks in Honor of the Philosopher Nicholas Rescher|date=13 April 2021 }}</ref></blockquote>

==Prize and medal==
In 2010, the University of Pittsburgh created the Dr. Nicholas Rescher Fund for the Advancement of the Department of Philosophy which bestows the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Contributions to Systematic Philosophy.<ref name=International/> The first recipient of the prize was Rescher's former student, [[Ernest Sosa]]. As of 2012, the prize included a gold medal and $25,000, subsequently raised to $30,000. Later awardees have included [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Jürgen Mittelstraß]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Ruth Millikan]], and [[Thomas Nagel]].<ref>{{harvnb | Anderson | 2012}}</ref> When the American Philosophical Association inaugurated its own Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy in 2018, the University of Pittsburgh redesignated its award as the Rescher Medal.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}
