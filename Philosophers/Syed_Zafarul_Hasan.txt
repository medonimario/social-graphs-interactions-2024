'''Syed Zafarul Hasan''' (14 February 1885 – 19 June 1949) was a prominent twentieth-century Pakistani [[Muslim]] [[philosopher]].

==Biography==

He was the eldest son of Khan Sahib Syed Diwan Mohammad.

Hasan was educated at Aligarh (M.A., LL. B.) and obtained doctorates from the universities of [[Erlangen]] and [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]], and [[Oxford University]]. Dr Zafarul Hasan was the first Muslim Scholar of the Indian sub-continent to secure a PhD from Oxford in Philosophy. His doctoral thesis ''Realism'' is a classic on the subject. Prominent philosophers and educationists lauded his work, among them, his teacher Prof. John Alaxander Smith (1863–1930), and Allama Mohammad Iqbal.

He started teaching at the [[Aligarh Muslim University]], Aligarh, India in 1911. In 1913, he became professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Islamia College University|Islamia College]], Peshawar.

There, in 1939, he put forward the 'Aligarh Scheme' along with Dr Afzaal Hussain Qadri. They published a scheme ("The Problem of Indian Muslims") proposing three independent States.

From 1945 until the partition of the sub-continent, Dr Hasan was [[Emeritus]] Professor at [[Aligarh]]. In August 1947, he migrated to [[Lahore, Pakistan]]. He started work on a book that he could not complete due to his death in 1949. Only one volume ("PHILOSOPHY - A Critique") was ready, which was published from Lahore by [[Institute of Islamic Culture]] in 1988.
