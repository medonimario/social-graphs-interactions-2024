'''Eugen Karl Dühring''' ({{IPA|de|ˈdyːʁɪŋ|lang}}; 12 January 1833 – 21 September 1921) was an [[antisemitic]], [[positivist]] and [[socialist]] German philosopher and economist who was a strong critic of [[Marxism]].

== Life and works ==
Dühring was born in [[Berlin]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. After a legal education he practised law in Berlin until 1859. A weakness of the eyes, ending in total [[blindness]], led him to take up the studies with which his name is now connected. In 1864, he became [[docent]] of the [[University of Berlin]], but, in consequence of a quarrel with the professoriate, was deprived of his licence to teach in 1874.<ref name=EB1911/>

Among his works are {{lang|de|Kapital und Arbeit}} (1865); {{lang|de|Der Wert des Lebens}} (1865); {{lang|de|Natürliche Dialektik}} (1865); {{lang|de|Kritische Geschichte der Philosophie (von ihren Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart)}} (1869); {{lang|de|Kritische Geschichte der allgemeinen Principien der Mechanik}} (1872), one of his most successful works; {{lang|de|Kursus der National und Sozialokonomie}} (1873); {{lang|de|Kursus der Philosophie}} (1875), entitled in a later edition {{lang|de|Wirklichkeitsphilosophie}}; {{lang|de|Logik und Wissenschaftstheorie}} (1878); and {{lang|de|Der Ersatz der Religion durch Vollkommeneres}} (1883).<ref name=EB1911/> He also published {{lang|de|Die Judenfrage als Racen-, Sitten- und Culturfrage}} (1881, ''The Jewish Question as a Racial, Moral, and Cultural Question'').<ref name="Dühring1881">{{Cite book|last=Dühring|first=Eugen|year=1881|title=Die Judenfrage als Racen-, Sitten- und Culturfrage: Mit einer weltgeschichtlichen Antwort|trans-title=The Jewish Question as a Racial, Moral, and Cultural Question: With a World-historical Answer|url=https://archive.org/details/Duehring-Die-Judenfrage-2|format=PDF scan|language=de|edition=1st|publisher=H.

He published his autobiography in 1882 under the title {{lang|de|Sache, Leben und Feinde}}; the mention of {{lang|de|Feinde}} ('enemies') is characteristic. Dühring's [[philosophy]] claims to be emphatically the philosophy of reality. He is passionate in his denunciation of everything which, like [[mysticism]], tries to veil reality. He is, in the words of historian [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]] "almost [[Lucretius|Lucretian]] in his anger against religion"<ref>Hayes, ''A Generation of Materialism'', 1941, p. 128.</ref> which would withdraw the secret of the universe from our direct gaze. His substitute for religion is a doctrine in many points akin to [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach]], the former of whom he resembles in his [[Sentimentalism (philosophy)|sentimentalism]].<ref name=EB1911/>

Dühring's economic views are said to derive largely from those of [[Friedrich List]].<ref>"It would be better to read Herr Dühring's chapter on mercantilism in the 'original', that is, in F. List's National System, Chapter 29..." ''[[Anti-Dühring]].''</ref><ref>"Eugen Dühring", a lecturer at the university of Berlin, declared that List's doctrines represented 'the first real advance' in economics since the publication of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.  (Henderson, William O. Friedrich List: Economist and Visionary (Frank Cass, London 1983).</ref> On other matters, particularly their attitudes toward Jews, the two men held very different opinions.<ref>"Up to the time of Philip II... Spain possessed all the elements of greatness and prosperity, when bigotry, in alliance with despotism, set to work to stifle the high spirit of the nation. The first commencement of this work of darkness was the expulsion of the Jews, and its crowning act the expulsion of the Moors, whereby two millions of the most industrious and well-to-do inhabitants were driven out of Spain with their capital." (From List's ''The National System of Political Economy'', p. 58.)</ref>

== Thought ==
He was "deeply" influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] throughout his career.<ref>This is according to historian [[Frederick C. Beiser]] in his ''[[Weltschmerz]]: [[Pessimism]] in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2018, Chapter 6, "The Optimism of Eugen Dühring," p. 87. "As a young man Dühring read Schopenhauer, who deeply impressed him. He admired his clarity, rigour and bluntness, and especially his stand against university philosophy. In his opinion, in breadth and depth, Schopenhauer stood head and shoulders above all the [[German Idealism|post-Kantians]]. It was Schopenhauer's great merit, Dühring believed, to have dragged philosophy out of its scholastic cocoon and to have made it confront the greatest question of them all: to be or not to be. That question was for Dühring nothing less than 'the chief theme of philosophy.' " (''Der Werth des Lebens'' (1865), p. 1.</ref> Dühring's opinions changed considerably after his first appearance as a writer. His earlier work, {{lang|de|Natürliche Dialektik}} (''Natural Dialectics''), is entirely in the spirit of [[critical philosophy]]. Later, in his movement towards [[positivism]], beginning with the publication of {{lang|de|Kritische Geschichte der Philosophie}} (''Critical History of Philosophy''), he rejects [[Immanuel Kant]]'s separation of [[phenomenon]] from [[noumenon]] and claims that our intellect is capable of grasping the whole reality. This adequacy of thought to things is because the universe contains but one reality, i.e. matter. It is to matter that we must look for the explanation both of conscious and of physical states. But matter is not, in his system, to be understood with the common meaning, but with a deeper sense as the substratum of all conscious and physical existence; and thus the laws of being are identified with the laws of thought. In this idealistic system Dühring finds room for [[teleology]]. The end of [[nature]], he holds, is the production of a race of conscious beings. From his belief in teleology he is not deterred by the enigma of pain. As a determined optimist, he asserts that pain exists to throw pleasure into conscious relief.<ref name=EB1911/>

In ethics, Dühring follows [[Auguste Comte]] in making sympathy the foundation of morality. In political philosophy, he teaches an ethical [[communism]] and attacks [[Herbert Spencer]]'s principle of [[Social Darwinism]]. In economics, he is best known by his vindication of the American writer [[H. C. Carey]], who attracts him both by his theory of value, which suggests an ultimate harmony of the interests of capitalists and labourers; and also by his doctrine of national political economy, which advocates protection on the ground that the morals and culture of a people are promoted by having its whole system of industry complete within its own borders. His patriotism is fervent, but narrow and exclusive. He idolized [[Frederick the Great]], and denounced [[Jews]], [[Greeks]], and the cosmopolitan [[Goethe]]. His writing has been characterized as clear and incisive, "though disfigured by arrogance and ill-temper, failings which may be extenuated on the ground of his physical affliction".<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Dühring, Eugen Karl|volume=8|page=649|first=Henry|last=Sturt|authorlink=Henry Sturt, 1st Baron Alington}}</ref>

Throughout his life, Dühring was a vehement antisemite and was one of the first proponents of [[racial antisemitism]] in Germany. In 1881 Dühring's pamphlet ''Die Judenfrage als Racen-, Sitten- und Culturfrage (The Jewish Question as a Question of Race, Morals and Culture)'' was published. It was a pseudo-scientific attempt to give antisemitism as a political movement a biological, historical, and philosophical foundation. He described the "Jewish question" similarly to [[Wilhelm Marr]], as an expression of an irresolvable [[racial antagonism]], and openly advocated for the "murder and extermination" of Jews as a solution to the Jewish question.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rose |first=Paul Lawrence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UhwABAAAQBAJ |title=German Question/Jewish Question: Revolutionary Antisemitism in Germany from Kant to Wagner |date=2014-07-14 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-6111-8 |language=en}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
[[File:Potsdam Friedhof Goethestr Babelsberg asv2023-08 img09.jpg|thumb|Grave of Dühring in Potsdam]]
He is chiefly remembered among English-speakers because of [[Engels]]' criticism of his views in {{lang|de|[[Anti-Dühring]]}}: Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science. Engels wrote his {{lang|de|Anti-Dühring}} in opposition to Dühring's ideas, which had found some disciples among the German [[Social Democrats (Germany)|Social Democrats]]. He is also the most prominent representative of the [[socialism]] of that era attacked by [[Nietzsche]] in his later works. Most of Dühring's work remains unavailable in English, aside from his work on the [[Jewish question]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dühring|first=Eugen|title=Eugen Dühring on the Jews|year=1997|publisher=Nineteen Eighty Four Press|location=Brighton, England|isbn=0-906879-31-0|pages=228}}</ref> Dühring's writing on the Jewish question influenced later antisemites and racist thinkers such as [[Theodor Fritsch]]'','' [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer|Georg von Schönerer]]. Through this legacy, Dühring's antisemitic views later found their way into the racial doctrines of [[Nazism]].<ref>Gerd-Klaus Kaltenbrunner, ''Vom Konkurrenten des Karl Marx zum Vorläufer Hitlers: Eugen Dühring'', in: Karl Schwedhelm (Hrsg.): ''Propheten des Nationalsozialismus'', 1969.</ref> 

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] heavily criticized Dühring's opinions on morality in his work [[On the Genealogy of Morality]]:

<blockquote>I again remind readers who have ears to hear of that [[apostle]] of revenge from Berlin, Eugen Dühring, who makes the most indecent and disgusting use of moral clap-trap of anyone in Germany today: Dühring, today's biggest loudmouth of morality, even amongst his kind, the anti-Semites.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich Wilhelm |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1130664996 |title=On the Genealogy of Morality |date=15 March 2020 |isbn=978-1-83857-572-4 |pages=91 |publisher=Arcturus Publishing Limited |oclc=1130664996}}</ref></blockquote>

"Heroic [[materialism]]" characterised Dühring's [[philosophy]]. He attacked [[capitalism]], [[Marxism]], and organised [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]].  Many scholars<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordis|first=Daniel|title=Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn|year=2016|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|location=New York, NY|pages=18}}</ref> believe that Dühring's invention of a modern-sounding antisemitism helped persuade [[Theodor Herzl]] that [[Zionism]] was the only answer: {{quote|Herzl acknowledged this over and over in his diaries and correspondence: "I will fight anti-Semitism in the place it originated—in Germany and in Austria," he said in one letter. He identified the genealogy of modern, racist antisemitism in the writings of the German social scientist Dr. Eugen Duehring in the 1890s.<ref>[http://www.wzo.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1273 Herzl's Road to Zionism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112013427/http://www.wzo.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1273 |date=January 12, 2007 }}</ref>}}
