Huygens first identified the correct laws of [[elastic collision]] in his work ''De Motu Corporum ex Percussione'', completed in 1656 but published posthumously in 1703.<ref name=":28">[[Gabbey, Alan]] (1980).

Cambridge: 354</ref> In optics, he is best known for his [[wave theory of light]], which he described in his ''[[Treatise on Light|Traité de la Lumière]]'' (1690). His theory of light was initially rejected in favour of Newton's [[corpuscular theory of light]], until [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] adapted Huygens's principle to give a complete explanation of the rectilinear propagation and diffraction effects of light in 1821. Today this principle is known as the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]].

Huygens invented the pendulum clock in 1657, which he patented the same year. His [[Horology|horological research]] resulted in an extensive analysis of the [[pendulum]] in ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'' (1673), regarded as one of the most important 17th century works on mechanics.<ref name=":7" /> While it contains descriptions of clock designs, most of the book is an analysis of pendular motion and a theory of [[curve]]s. In 1655, Huygens began grinding lenses with his brother Constantijn to build [[refracting telescope]]s. He discovered Saturn's biggest moon, Titan, and was the first to explain Saturn's strange appearance as due to "a thin, flat ring, nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic."<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=van Helden|first=Albert|date=2004|title=Huygens, Titan, and Saturn's ring|journal=Titan – from Discovery to Encounter|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ESASP1278...11V|volume=1278|pages=11–29|bibcode=2004ESASP1278...11V|access-date=12 April 2021|archive-date=15 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415083622/http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ESASP1278...11V|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1662 Huygens developed what is now called the [[Huygenian eyepiece]], a telescope with two lenses to diminish the amount of [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Louwman|first=Peter|date=2004|title=Christiaan Huygens and his telescopes|journal=Titan – from Discovery to Encounter|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ESASP1278..103L|volume=1278|pages=103–114|bibcode=2004ESASP1278..103L|access-date=12 April 2021|archive-date=2 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902210758/https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ESASP1278..103L/abstract|url-status=live}}</ref>

As a mathematician, Huygens developed the [[Evolute|theory of evolutes]] and wrote on [[Game of chance|games of chance]] and the [[problem of points]] in ''Van Rekeningh in Spelen van Gluck'', which [[Frans van Schooten]] translated and published as ''De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae'' (1657).<ref name=":25" /> The use of [[expectation value|expected value]]s by Huygens and others would later inspire [[Jacob Bernoulli|Jacob Bernoulli's]] work on [[Ars Conjectandi|probability theory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2005-01-01|title=Jakob Bernoulli, Ars conjectandi (1713)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444508713500875|journal=Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640–1940|language=en|pages=88–104|doi=10.1016/B978-044450871-3/50087-5|last1=Schneider|first1=Ivo|isbn=9780444508713|access-date=15 April 2021|archive-date=15 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415033934/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444508713500875|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Shafer|first=G.|date=2018|title=Marie-France Bru and Bernard Bru on Dice Games and Contracts|journal=Statistical Science|volume=33|issue=2|pages=277–284|doi=10.1214/17-STS639|issn=0883-4237|doi-access=free}}</ref>

[[Constantijn Huygens]] was a diplomat and advisor to the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]], in addition to being a poet and a musician. He [[Republic of Letters|corresponded widely]] with intellectuals across Europe; his friends included [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Marin Mersenne]], and [[René Descartes]].<ref>''The Heirs of Archimedes: Science and the Art of War Through the Age of Enlightenment'', by Brett D.

In 1644, Huygens had as his mathematical tutor [[Jan Jansz de Jonge Stampioen|Jan Jansz Stampioen]], who assigned the 15-year-old a demanding reading list on contemporary science.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jozef T.

===Student years===
At sixteen years of age, Constantijn sent Huygens to study law and mathematics at [[Leiden University]], where he studied from May 1645 to March 1647.<ref name="completedictionary"/> [[Frans van Schooten]] was an academic at Leiden from 1646, and became a private tutor to Huygens and his elder brother, Constantijn Jr., replacing Stampioen on the advice of Descartes.<ref>{{cite book|author=H.

After two years, starting in March 1647, Huygens continued his studies at the newly founded [[Orange College of Breda|Orange College]], in [[Breda]], where his father was a [[curator]]. Constantijn Huygens was closely involved in the new College, which lasted only to 1669; the rector was [[André Rivet]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Andriesse|first=C.

His time in Breda ended around the time when his brother Lodewijk, who was enrolled at the school, duelled with another student.<ref name=":14" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Christiaan Huygens – A family affair, by Bram Stoffele, pg 80. |url=http://www.proevenvanvroeger.nl/eindopdrachten/huygens/huygensfamily.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812225640/http://proevenvanvroeger.nl/eindopdrachten/huygens/huygensfamily.pdf |archive-date=12 August 2017 |access-date=16 February 2013}}</ref> Huygens left Breda after completing his studies in August 1649 and had a stint as a diplomat on a mission with [[Henry, Duke of Nassau]].<ref name="completedictionary"/> It took him to [[County of Bentheim (district)|Bentheim]], then [[Flensburg]]. He took off for Denmark, visited [[Copenhagen]] and [[Helsingør]], and hoped to cross the [[Øresund]] to visit Descartes in [[Stockholm]]. This did not happen as Descartes had died in the interim.<ref name=":14" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Stoffele |first=B. |date=2006 |title=Christiaan Huygens – A family affair - Proeven van Vroeger |url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/15920743/christiaan-huygens-a-family-affair-proeven-van-vroeger |access-date=2023-11-27 |website=Utrecht University |language=en}}</ref>

Although his father Constantijn had wished his son Christiaan to be a diplomat, circumstances kept him from becoming so. The [[First Stadtholderless Period]] that began in 1650 meant that the House of Orange was no longer in power, removing Constantijn's influence. Further, he realized that his son had no interest in such a career.<ref name="Dictionary, p. 469">Bunge et al.

===Early correspondence===
[[File:KettingHyugens.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Picture of a hanging chain ([[catenary]]) in a manuscript of Huygens.]]
Huygens generally wrote in French or Latin.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lynn Thorndike|title=History of Magic & Experimental Science 1923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sr923sVWH_QC&pg=PA622|access-date=11 May 2013|date=1 March 2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-4316-6|page=622|archive-date=13 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013023137/http://books.google.com/books?id=Sr923sVWH_QC&pg=PA622|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1646, while still a college student at Leiden, he began a correspondence with his father's friend, [[Marin Mersenne]], who died soon afterwards in 1648.<ref name="completedictionary"/> Mersenne wrote to Constantijn on his son's talent for mathematics, and flatteringly compared him to Archimedes on 3 January 1647.<ref name=":10" />

The letters show Huygens's early interest in mathematics. In October 1646 there is the [[suspension bridge]] and the demonstration that a [[Catenary|hanging chain]] is not a [[parabola]], as Galileo thought.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leonhard Euler|editor=[[Clifford Truesdell]]|title=The Rational Mechanics of Flexible or Elastic Bodies 1638–1788: Introduction to Vol. X and XI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxrzm6y10EwC&pg=PA44|access-date=10 May 2013|date=1 January 1980|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-7643-1441-5|pages=44–6|author-link=Leonhard Euler|archive-date=13 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013023135/http://books.google.com/books?id=gxrzm6y10EwC&pg=PA44|url-status=live}}</ref> Huygens would later label that curve the ''catenaria'' ([[catenary]]) in 1690 while corresponding with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]].<ref name=":16">{{Cite journal|last=Bukowski|first=J.|date=2008|title=Christiaan Huygens and the Problem of the Hanging Chain|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/07468342.2008.11922269|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=39|issue=1|pages=2–11|doi=10.1080/07468342.2008.11922269|s2cid=118886615}}</ref>

In the next two years (1647–48), Huygens's letters to Mersenne covered various topics, including a mathematical proof of the [[Free fall|law of free fall]], the claim by [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent]] of [[squaring the circle|circle quadrature]], which Huygens showed to be wrong, the rectification of the ellipse, projectiles, and the [[vibrating string]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Andriesse|first=C.

Huygens preferred [[meantone temperament]]; he innovated in [[31 equal temperament]] (which was not itself a new idea but known to [[Francisco de Salinas]]), using logarithms to investigate it further and show its close relation to the meantone system.<ref name="Cohen1984">{{cite book|author=H.F.

In 1654, Huygens returned to his father's house in The Hague and was able to devote himself entirely to research.<ref name="completedictionary" /> The family had another house, not far away at [[Hofwijck]], and he spent time there during the summer. Despite being very active, his scholarly life did not allow him to escape bouts of depression.<ref name=":9">{{cite book|author=H. J. M.

Subsequently, Huygens developed a broad range of correspondents, though with some difficulty after 1648 due to the five-year ''[[Fronde]]'' in France. Visiting Paris in 1655, Huygens called on [[Ismael Boulliau]] to introduce himself, who took him to see [[Claude Mylon]].<ref>{{cite book|author=C. D.

===Scientific debut===
[[File:Christiaan Huygens by Jaques Clerion.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Christiaan Huygens, relief by [[Jean-Jacques Clérion]] (c. 1670).]]
Like some of his contemporaries, Huygens was often slow to commit his results and discoveries to print, preferring to disseminate his work through letters instead.<ref name=":12" /> In his early days, his mentor Frans van Schooten provided technical feedback and was cautious for the sake of his reputation.<ref>{{cite book|author=C.

Between 1651 and 1657, Huygens published a number of works that showed his talent for mathematics and his mastery of [[Euclidean geometry|classical]] and [[Analytic geometry|analytical geometry]], increasing his reach and reputation among mathematicians.<ref name=":10" /> Around the same time, Huygens began to question Descartes's laws of [[collision]], which were largely wrong, deriving the correct laws algebraically and later by way of geometry.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal|last=Hyslop|first=S.

In addition to his mathematical and mechanical works, Huygens made important scientific discoveries: he was the first to identify [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] as one of [[Saturn|Saturn's]] moons in 1655, invented the pendulum clock in 1657, and explained Saturn's strange appearance as due to a [[Rings of Saturn|ring]] in 1659; all these discoveries brought him fame across Europe.<ref name="completedictionary" /> On 3 May 1661, Huygens, together with astronomer [[Thomas Streete]] and Richard Reeve, observed the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] transit over the Sun using Reeve's telescope in London.<ref>Peter Louwman, Christiaan Huygens and his telescopes, Proceedings of the International Conference, 13 – 17 April 2004, ESTEC, Noordwijk, Netherlands, ESA, sp 1278, Paris 2004</ref> Streete then debated the published record of [[Hevelius]], a controversy mediated by [[Henry Oldenburg]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Adrian Johns|title=The Nature of the Book: Print and Knowledge in the Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERpBdEUdhz8C&pg=PA437|access-date=23 April 2013|date=15 May 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-40123-2|pages=437–8|archive-date=17 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617101026/https://books.google.com/books?id=ERpBdEUdhz8C&pg=PA437|url-status=live}}</ref> Huygens passed to Hevelius a manuscript of [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] on the [[transit of Venus, 1639|transit of Venus in 1639]], printed for the first time in 1662.<ref>{{cite book|title=Venus Seen on the Sun: The First Observation of a Transit of Venus by Jeremiah Horrocks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlA6UCyOboUC&pg=PR19|access-date=23 April 2013|date=2 March 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-22193-2|page=xix|archive-date=16 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616202523/https://books.google.com/books?id=KlA6UCyOboUC&pg=PR19|url-status=live}}</ref>

Huygens demonstrated that the centre of gravity of a segment of any [[hyperbola]], [[ellipse]], or [[circle]] was directly related to the area of that segment. He was then able to show the relationships between triangles inscribed in conic sections and the centre of gravity for those sections. By generalizing these theorems to cover all conic sections, Huygens extended classical methods to generate new results.<ref name="completedictionary" />

Quadrature was a live issue in the 1650s and, through Mylon, Huygens intervened in the discussion of the mathematics of [[Thomas Hobbes]]. Persisting in trying to explain the errors Hobbes had fallen into, he made an international reputation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Schoneveld, Cornelis W|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1s4UAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA41|title=Intertraffic of the Mind: Studies in Seventeenth-century Anglo-Dutch Translation with a Checklist of Books Translated from English Into Dutch, 1600–1700|date=1983|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-90-04-06942-8|page=41|access-date=22 April 2013|archive-date=16 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616220726/https://books.google.com/books?id=1s4UAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA41|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== ''De Circuli Magnitudine Inventa'' ====
Huygens's next publication was ''De Circuli Magnitudine Inventa'' (''New findings in the measurement of the circle''), published in 1654. In this work, Huygens was able to narrow the gap between the circumscribed and inscribed polygons found in Archimedes's [[Measurement of a Circle|''Measurement of the Circle'']], showing that the ratio of the circumference to its diameter or ''[[Pi|π]]'' must lie in the first third of that interval.<ref name=":12" />

=== Unpublished work ===
[[File:Huygens floating bodies.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Huygens's results for the stability of a floating rectangular [[parallelepiped]].]]
Huygens had earlier completed a manuscript in the manner of Archimedes's ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'' entitled ''De Iis quae Liquido Supernatant'' (''About parts floating above liquids''). It was written around 1650 and was made up of three books. Although he sent the completed work to Frans van Schooten for feedback, in the end Huygens chose not to publish it, and at one point suggested it be burned.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":11" /> Some of the results found here were not rediscovered until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.<ref name=":28" />

Huygens first re-derives Archimedes's solutions for the stability of the sphere and the paraboloid by a clever application of Torricelli's principle (i.e., that bodies in a system move only if their centre of gravity descends).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gaukroger|first=S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCeQDwAAQBAJ&dq=Alan+Gabbey+%E2%80%98Huygens+and+Mechanics%E2%80%99&pg=PA425|title=The Emergence of a Scientific Culture: Science and the Shaping of Modernity 1210-1685|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-156391-1|pages=424–425|language=en}}</ref> He then proves the general theorem that, for a floating body in equilibrium, the distance between its centre of gravity and its submerged portion is at a minimum.<ref name=":28" /> Huygens uses this theorem to arrive at original solutions for the stability of floating [[cone]]s, [[parallelepiped]]s, and [[cylinder]]s, in some cases through a full cycle of rotation.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Nowacki|first1=H.|title=Historical Roots of the Theory of Hydrostatic Stability of Ships|date=2011|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1482-3_8|work=Contemporary Ideas on Ship Stability and Capsizing in Waves|pages=141–180|editor-last=Almeida Santos Neves|editor-first=M.|series=Fluid Mechanics and Its Applications|place=Dordrecht|publisher=Springer Netherlands|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-1482-3_8|isbn=978-94-007-1482-3|access-date=2021-10-26|last2=Ferreiro|first2=L.

===Laws of motion, impact, and gravitation===
==== Elastic collisions ====
[[File:Collision huygens.gif|thumb|A boating metaphor as a way to think about [[relative motion]], simplifying the theory of colliding bodies, from Huygens's ''Oeuvres Complètes''.]]
The general approach of the mechanical philosophers was to postulate theories of the kind now called "contact action." Huygens adopted this method but not without seeing its limitations,<ref>{{cite book|author=Cao|first=T.

Huygens concluded quite early that [[Cartesian laws of motion|Descartes's laws]] for elastic collisions were largely wrong, and he formulated the correct laws, including the conservation of the product of mass times the square of the speed for hard bodies, and the conservation of quantity of motion in one direction for all bodies.<ref>''The Beginnings of Modern Science'', edited by Rene Taton, Basic Books, 1958, 1964.</ref> An important step was his recognition of the [[Galilean invariance]] of the problems.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Garber|first1=D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPlkkgIhUXIC|title=The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-century Philosophy|last2=Ayers|first2=M.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-521-53720-9|pages=666–667|language=en}}</ref> Huygens had worked out the laws of collision from 1652 to 1656 in a manuscript entitled ''De Motu Corporum ex Percussione'', though his results took many years to be circulated.

==== Centrifugal force ====
In 1659 Huygens found the constant of [[gravitational acceleration]] and stated what is now known as the second of [[Newton's laws of motion]] in quadratic form.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mach |first=E. |url=http://archive.org/details/scienceofmechani005860mbp |title=The Science Of Mechanics |publisher=The Open Court Publishing Co. |others=Universal Digital Library |year=1919 |pages=143–187}}</ref> He derived geometrically the now standard formula for the [[centrifugal force]], exerted on an object when viewed in a rotating [[frame of reference]], for instance when driving around a curve. In modern notation:

:<math>F_{c}={m\ \omega^2}{r}</math>

with ''m'' the [[mass (physics)|mass]] of the object, ''ω'' the [[angular velocity]], and ''r'' the [[radius]].<ref name=":28" /> Huygens collected his results in a treatise under the title ''De vi Centrifuga'', unpublished until 1703, where the kinematics of free fall were used to produce the first generalized conception of [[force]] prior to Newton.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Westfall |first=R.

==== Gravitation ====
The general idea for the centrifugal force, however, was published in 1673 and was a significant step in studying orbits in astronomy. It enabled the transition from [[Kepler's third law]] of planetary motion to the [[inverse square law]] of gravitation.<ref>{{cite book|author=J. B.

The approach used by Huygens also missed some central notions of mathematical physics, which were not lost on others. In his work on pendulums Huygens came very close to the theory of [[simple harmonic motion]]; the topic, however, was covered fully for the first time by Newton in Book II of the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687).<ref name="Allen1999">{{cite book|author=Richard Allen|title=David Hartley on human nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCu6HhGlAB8C&pg=PA98|access-date=12 May 2013|date=1999|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-9451-6|page=98|archive-date=17 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617113017/https://books.google.com/books?id=NCu6HhGlAB8C&pg=PA98|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1678 Leibniz picked out of Huygens's work on collisions the idea of [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]] that Huygens had left implicit.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicholas Jolley|title=The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnRis5Gdi8gC&pg=PA279|access-date=12 May 2013|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-36769-1|page=279|archive-date=17 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617035641/https://books.google.com/books?id=SnRis5Gdi8gC&pg=PA279|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1657, inspired by earlier research into pendulums as regulating mechanisms, Huygens invented the pendulum clock, which was a breakthrough in timekeeping and became the most accurate timekeeper for almost 300 years until the 1930s.<ref>{{cite journal

Part of the incentive for inventing the pendulum clock was to create an accurate [[marine chronometer]] that could be used to find [[longitude]] by [[celestial navigation]] during sea voyages. However, the clock proved unsuccessful as a marine timekeeper because the rocking motion of the ship disturbed the motion of the pendulum. In 1660, Lodewijk Huygens made a trial on a voyage to Spain, and reported that heavy weather made the clock useless. [[Alexander Bruce, 2nd Earl of Kincardine|Alexander Bruce]] entered the field in 1662, and Huygens called in Sir Robert Moray and the Royal Society to mediate and preserve some of his rights.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=N.|date=2008|title=Marketing Longitude: Clocks, Kings, Courtiers, and Christiaan Huygens|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30227413|journal=Book History|volume=11|pages=59–88|jstor=30227413|issn=1098-7371}}</ref><ref name=":17" /> Trials continued into the 1660s, the best news coming from a Royal Navy captain [[Robert Holmes (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Holmes]] operating against the Dutch possessions in 1664.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael R.

A trial for the French Academy on an expedition to [[Cayenne]] ended badly. [[Jean Richer]] suggested correction for the [[figure of the Earth]]. By the time of the [[Dutch East India Company]] expedition of 1686 to the [[Cape of Good Hope]], Huygens was able to supply the correction retrospectively.<ref>Bunge et al. (2003), ''Dictionary of Seventeenth and Eighteenth-Century Dutch Philosophers,'' p. 471.</ref>

==== ''Horologium Oscillatorium'' ====
[[Image:Evolute-parab-1-e.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the evolute of a curve.]]
Sixteen years after the invention of the pendulum clock, in 1673, Huygens published his major work on horology entitled ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium|Horologium Oscillatorium: Sive de Motu Pendulorum ad Horologia Aptato Demonstrationes Geometricae]] (The Pendulum Clock: or Geometrical demonstrations concerning the motion of pendula as applied to clocks''). It is the first modern work on mechanics where a physical problem is idealized by a set of parameters then analysed mathematically.<ref name=":7" />

Huygens's motivation came from the observation, made by Mersenne and others, that pendulums are not quite [[isochronous]]: their period depends on their width of swing, with wide swings taking slightly longer than narrow swings.<ref name=":29">{{cite conference |last=Mahoney |first=M. S. |date=1980 |title=Christian Huygens: The Measurement of Time and of Longitude at Sea |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~mike/articles/huygens/timelong/timelong.html#_N_13 |conference= |publisher=Swets |pages=234–270 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204152637/http://www.princeton.edu/~mike/articles/huygens/timelong/timelong.html#_N_13 |archive-date=4 December 2007 |access-date=7 October 2010 |book-title=Studies on Christiaan Huygens}}</ref> He tackled this problem by finding the curve down which a mass will slide under the influence of gravity in the same amount of time, regardless of its starting point; the so-called [[tautochrone curve|tautochrone problem]]. By geometrical methods which anticipated the [[calculus]], Huygens showed it to be a [[cycloid]], rather than the circular arc of a pendulum's bob, and therefore that pendulums needed to move on a cycloid path in order to be isochronous. The mathematics necessary to solve this problem led Huygens to develop his theory of evolutes, which he presented in Part III of his ''Horologium Oscillatorium''.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":21">{{Cite book|last1=Huygens|first1=Christiaan|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000875808|title=Christiaan Huygens' the pendulum clock, or, Geometrical demonstrations concerning the motion of pendula as applied to clocks|last2=Blackwell|first2=R. J.|date=1986|publisher=Iowa State University Press|isbn=978-0-8138-0933-5|location=Ames}}</ref>

He also solved a problem posed by Mersenne earlier: how to calculate the period of a pendulum made of an arbitrarily-shaped swinging rigid body. This involved discovering the [[center of oscillation|centre of oscillation]] and its reciprocal relationship with the pivot point. In the same work, he analysed the [[conical pendulum]], consisting of a weight on a cord moving in a circle, using the concept of centrifugal force.<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Slisko|first1=J.|last2=Cruz|first2=A. C.|date=2019|title=String Tension in Pendulum and Circular Motions: Forgotten Contributions of Huygens in Today Teaching and Learning|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1299946|journal=European Journal of Physics Education|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=55–68|issn=1309-7202}}</ref>

Huygens was the first to derive the formula for the [[Frequency|period]] of an ideal mathematical pendulum (with mass-less rod or cord and length much longer than its swing), in modern notation:

:<math>T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}</math>

with ''T'' the period, ''l'' the length of the pendulum and ''g'' the [[gravitational acceleration]]. By his study of the oscillation period of compound pendulums Huygens made pivotal contributions to the development of the concept of [[moment of inertia]].<ref name="mach">[[Ernst Mach]], ''The Science of Mechanics'' (1919), e.g. pp. 143, 172, 187 https://archive.org/details/scienceofmechani005860mbp</ref>

Huygens also observed [[coupled oscillation]]s: two of his pendulum clocks mounted next to each other on the same support often became synchronized, swinging in opposite directions. He reported the results by letter to the Royal Society, and it is referred to as "[[odd sympathy|an odd kind of sympathy]]" in the Society's minutes.<ref>A copy of the letter appears in C. Huygens, in Oeuvres Completes de Christian Huygens, edited by M. Nijhoff (Societe Hollandaise des Sciences, The Hague, The Netherlands, 1893), Vol. 5, p. 246 (in French).</ref> This concept is now known as [[Entrainment (physics)|entrainment]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Spoor|first1=P.

==== Balance spring watch ====
[[File:Drawing of one of Huygens first balance springs, attached to a balance wheel.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a balance spring invented by Huygens.]]
In 1675, while investigating the oscillating properties of the cycloid, Huygens was able to transform a cycloidal pendulum into a vibrating spring through a combination of geometry and higher mathematics.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Meli |first=Domenico Bertoloni |date=2010-10-01 |title=Patterns of Transformation in Seventeenth-Century Mechanics1 |url=https://doi.org/10.5840/monist201093433 |journal=The Monist |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=580–597 |doi=10.5840/monist201093433 |issn=0026-9662}}</ref> In the same year, Huygens designed a spiral [[balance spring]] and patented a [[pocket watch]]. These watches are notable for lacking a [[fusee (horology)|fusee]] for equalizing the mainspring torque. The implication is that Huygens thought his spiral spring would isochronize the balance in the same way that cycloid-shaped suspension curbs on his clocks would isochronize the pendulum.<ref name=":20" />

He later used spiral springs in more conventional watches, made for him by [[Thuret family|Thuret]] in Paris. Such springs are essential in modern watches with a detached [[lever escapement]] because they can be adjusted for [[isochronism]]. Watches in Huygens's time, however, employed the very ineffective [[verge escapement]], which interfered with the isochronal properties of any form of balance spring, spiral or otherwise.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whitestone|first=S.|date=2012|title=Christian Huygens' Lost and Forgotten Pamphlet of his Pendulum Invention|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00033790.2011.637470|journal=Annals of Science|volume=69|issue=1|pages=91–104|doi=10.1080/00033790.2011.637470|s2cid=143438492|issn=0003-3790}}</ref>

Huygens's design came around the same time as, though independently of, Robert Hooke's. Controversy over the priority of the balance spring persisted for centuries. In February 2006, a long-lost copy of Hooke's handwritten notes from several decades of Royal Society meetings was discovered in a cupboard in [[Hampshire]], England, presumably tipping the evidence in Hooke's favour.<ref>Nature – International Weekly Journal of Science, number 439, pages 638–639, 9 February 2006</ref><ref>Notes and Records of the Royal Society (2006) 60, pages 235–239, 'Report – The Return of the Hooke Folio' by Robyn Adams and Lisa Jardine</ref>

=== Optics ===
==== Dioptrics ====
[[File:Huygens Aerial telescope, 1684.jpg|thumb|190px|Huygens's [[aerial telescope]] from ''Astroscopia Compendiaria'' (1684).]]
Huygens had a long-term interest in the study of [[Refraction|light refraction]] and lenses or [[dioptrics]].<ref name=":27">Bunge et al. (2003), ''Dictionary of Seventeenth and Eighteenth-Century Dutch Philosophers,'' p. 472.</ref> From 1652 date the first drafts of a Latin treatise on the theory of dioptrics, known as the ''Tractatus'', which contained a comprehensive and rigorous theory of the telescope. Huygens was one of the few to raise theoretical questions regarding the properties and working of the telescope, and almost the only one to direct his mathematical proficiency towards the actual instruments used in astronomy.<ref>Dijksterhuis, F. J. (2004). Huygens and optics. In ''Titan-From Discovery to Encounter'' (Vol. 1278, pp. 81-89).</ref>

Huygens repeatedly announced its publication to his colleagues but ultimately postponed it in favor of a much more comprehensive treatment, now under the name of the ''Dioptrica''.<ref name=":0" /> It consisted of three parts. The first part focused on the general principles of refraction, the second dealt with [[Spherical aberration|spherical]] and [[chromatic aberration]], while the third covered all aspects of the construction of telescopes and microscopes. In contrast to Descartes' dioptrics which treated only ideal (elliptical and hyperbolical) lenses, Huygens dealt exclusively with spherical lenses, which were the only kind that could really be made and incorporated in devices such as microscopes and telescopes.<ref name=":26">{{Cite journal |last=Kubbinga |first=H. |date=1995 |title=Christiaan Huygens and the foundations of optics |url=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0963-9659/4/6/004/meta |journal=Pure and Applied Optics: Journal of the European Optical Society Part A |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=723–739|doi=10.1088/0963-9659/4/6/004 |bibcode=1995PApOp...4..723K }}</ref>

Huygens also worked out practical ways to minimize the effects of spherical and chromatic aberration, such as long focal distances for the objective of a telescope, internal stops to reduce the aperture, and a new kind of ocular known as the [[Huygenian eyepiece]].<ref name=":26" /> The ''Dioptrica'' was never published in Huygens’s lifetime and only appeared in press in 1703, when most of its contents were already familiar to the scientific world.

==== Lenses ====
Together with his brother Constantijn, Huygens began grinding his own lenses in 1655 in an effort to improve telescopes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert D.

Lenses were also a common interest through which Huygens could meet socially in the 1660s with [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], who ground them professionally. They had rather different outlooks on science, Spinoza being the more committed Cartesian, and some of their discussion survives in correspondence.<ref>{{cite book |author=Margaret Gullan-Whur |title=Within Reason: A Life of Spinoza |date=1998 |publisher=Jonathan Cape |isbn=0-224-05046-X |pages=170–1}}</ref> He encountered the work of [[Antoni van Leeuwenhoek]], another lens grinder, in the field of [[microscopy]] which interested his father.<ref name=":7" /> Huygens also investigated the use of lenses in projectors.

[[File:Huyghens - Traité de la lumière - Fig. 12-13.svg|thumb|Refraction of a plane wave, explained using Huygens's principle in ''[[Treatise on Light|Traité de la Lumière]]'' (1690).]]

Huygens is especially remembered in optics for his [[wave]] theory of light, which he first communicated in 1678 to the Académie des sciences in Paris. Originally a preliminary chapter of his ''Dioptrica'', Huygens's theory was published in 1690 under the title ''[[Treatise on Light|Traité de la Lumière]]''<ref>Christiaan Huygens, [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_X9PKaZlChggC ''Traité de la lumiere''...] (Leiden, Netherlands: Pieter van der Aa, 1690), Chapter 1.</ref> (''Treatise on light''), and contains the first fully mathematized, mechanistic explanation of an unobservable physical phenomenon (i.e., light propagation).<ref name=":6" /><ref name="HuyThomp1912">C.

The challenge at the time was to explain [[geometrical optics]], as most [[physical optics]] phenomena (such as [[diffraction]]) had not been observed or appreciated as issues. Huygens had experimented in 1672 with double refraction ([[birefringence]]) in the Iceland spar (a [[calcite]]), a phenomenon discovered in 1669 by [[Rasmus Bartholin]]. At first, he could not elucidate what he found but was later able to explain it using his wavefront theory and concept of evolutes.<ref name="HuyThomp1912" /> He also developed ideas on [[caustic (optics)|caustics]].<ref name=":7" /> Huygens assumes that the [[speed of light]] is finite, based on a report by [[Ole Rømer|Ole Christensen Rømer]] in 1677 but which Huygens is presumed to have already believed.<ref name="Smith1987">{{cite book|author=A.

His theory of light was not widely accepted, while Newton's rival [[corpuscular theory of light]], as found in his ''[[Opticks]]'' (1704), gained more support. One strong objection to Huygens's theory was that longitudinal waves have only a single [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] which cannot explain the observed birefringence. However, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s [[Young's interference experiment|interference experiments]] in 1801, and [[François Arago]]'s detection of the [[Poisson spot]] in 1819, could not be explained through Newton's or any other particle theory, reviving Huygens's ideas and wave models. [[Fresnel]] became aware of Huygens's work and in 1821 was able to explain birefringence as a result of light being not a longitudinal (as had been assumed) but actually a [[transverse wave]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Darryl J.

[[File:Huygens Systema Saturnium.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Huygens's explanation for the aspects of Saturn, ''Systema Saturnium'' (1659).]]
In 1655, Huygens discovered the first of Saturn's moons, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and observed and sketched the [[Orion Nebula]] using a [[refracting telescope]] with a 43x magnification of his own design.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> Huygens succeeded in subdividing the nebula into different stars (the brighter interior now bears the name of the ''Huygenian region'' in his honour), and discovered several [[nebula|interstellar nebulae]] and some [[double star]]s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Antony Cooke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T64M5qlZTxoC&pg=PA67 |title=Visual Astronomy Under Dark Skies: A New Approach to Observing Deep Space |date=1 January 2005 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-84628-149-5 |page=67 |access-date=24 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617062337/https://books.google.com/books?id=T64M5qlZTxoC&pg=PA67 |archive-date=17 June 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> He was also the first to propose that the [[rings of Saturn|appearance of Saturn]], which had baffled astronomers, was due to "a thin, flat ring, nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic”.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Baalke|first=R.|date=2011|title=Historical Background of Saturn's Rings|url=https://solarviews.com/eng/saturnbg.htm|url-status=live|access-date=|website=solarviews.com|publisher=Later, it was determined that Saturn's rings were not solid but made of several smaller bodies.|archive-date=11 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210711063716/https://solarviews.com/eng/saturnbg.htm}}</ref>

More than three years later, in 1659, Huygens published his theory and findings in ''Systema Saturnium''. It is considered the most important work on telescopic astronomy since Galileo's ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' fifty years earlier.<ref name=":19">{{Cite journal |last=Chapman |first=A. |date=1995 |title=Christiaan huygens (1629–1695): astronomer and mechanician |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0160-9327%2895%2990076-4 |journal=Endeavour |language=en |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=140–145 |doi=10.1016/0160-9327(95)90076-4 |issn=0160-9327}}</ref> Much more than a report on Saturn, Huygens provided measurements for the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, introduced the concept of the [[Filar micrometer|micrometer]], and showed a method to measure angular diameters of planets, which finally allowed the telescope to be used as an instrument to measure (rather than just sighting) astronomical objects.<ref>Van Helden, A.

Swets & Zeitlinger B.V.</ref> He was also the first to question the authority of Galileo in telescopic matters, a sentiment that was to be common in the years following its publication.

In the same year, Huygens was able to observe [[Syrtis Major Planum|Syrtis Major]], a volcanic plain on [[Mars]]. He used repeated observations of the movement of this feature over the course of a number of days to estimate the length of day on Mars, which he did quite accurately to 24 1/2 hours. This figure is only a few minutes off of the actual length of the Martian day of 24 hours, 37 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marsdaily.com/reports/A_dark_spot_on_Mars_Syrtis_Major_999.html |website=www.marsdaily.com |title=A dark spot on Mars – Syrtis Major |date=February 3, 2012 |access-date=17 May 2016 |archive-date=21 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921162641/http://www.marsdaily.com/reports/A_dark_spot_on_Mars_Syrtis_Major_999.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Planetarium ====
At the instigation of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Huygens undertook the task of constructing a mechanical planetarium that could display all the planets and their moons then known circling around the Sun. Huygens completed his design in 1680 and had his clockmaker Johannes van Ceulen built it the following year. However, Colbert passed away in the interim and Huygens never got to deliver his planetarium to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] as the new minister, [[François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|François-Michel le Tellier]], decided not to renew Huygens's contract.<ref name=":1">van den Bosch, D.

In his design, Huygens made an ingenious use of [[continued fraction]]s to find the best rational approximations by which he could choose the gears with the correct number of teeth. The ratio between two gears determined the orbital periods of two planets. To move the planets around the Sun, Huygens used a clock-mechanism that could go forwards and backwards in time. Huygens claimed his planetarium was more accurate that a similar device constructed by [[Ole Rømer]] around the same time, but his planetarium design was not published until after his death in the ''Opuscula Posthuma'' (1703).<ref name=":1" />

==== ''Cosmotheoros'' ====
[[File:Christiaan Huygens Cosmotheoros - Relative sizes of sun and planets, 1698.jpg|thumb|200px|Relative sizes of the Sun and planets in ''Cosmotheoros'' (1698).]]
Shortly before his death in 1695, Huygens completed his most speculative work entitled ''Cosmotheoros''. At his direction, it was to be published only posthumously by his brother, which Constantijn Jr. did in 1698.<ref>Aldersey-Williams, Hugh, ''[https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/the-uncertain-heavens The Uncertain Heavens] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021223711/https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/the-uncertain-heavens/ |date=21 October 2020 }}'', [[Public Domain Review]], October 21, 2020</ref> In this work, Huygens speculated on the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]], which he imagined similar to that on Earth. Such speculations were not uncommon at the time, justified by [[Copernicanism]] or the [[plenitude principle]], but Huygens went into greater detail, though without acknowledging Newton's laws of gravitation or the fact that planetary atmospheres are composed of different gases.<ref>{{cite book|author=Philip C.

Huygens wrote that availability of water in liquid form was essential for life and that the properties of water must vary from planet to planet to suit the temperature range. He took his observations of dark and bright spots on the surfaces of Mars and Jupiter to be evidence of water and ice on those planets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brighthub.com/science/space/articles/50441.aspx |title=Johar Huzefa (2009) Nothing But The Facts – Christiaan Huygens |publisher=Brighthub.com |date=28 September 2009 |access-date=13 June 2010 |archive-date=27 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127020012/http://www.brighthub.com/science/space/articles/50441.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> He argued that extraterrestrial life is neither confirmed nor denied by the Bible, and questioned why God would create the other planets if they were not to serve a greater purpose than that of being admired from Earth. Huygens postulated that the great distance between the planets signified that God had not intended for beings on one to know about the beings on the others, and had not foreseen how much humans would advance in scientific knowledge.<ref name=":22">{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=M.|title=The Scientific Revolution|date=2010|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston|pages=29, 107–114}}</ref>

It was also in this book that Huygens published his estimates for the relative sizes of the [[Solar System|solar system]] and his method for calculating [[stellar distance]]s.<ref name=":14" /> He made a series of smaller holes in a screen facing the Sun, until he estimated the light was of the same intensity as that of the star [[Sirius]]. He then calculated that the angle of this hole was 1/27,664th the diameter of the Sun, and thus it was about 30,000 times as far away, on the (incorrect) assumption that Sirius is as luminous as the Sun. The subject of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] remained in its infancy until the time of [[Pierre Bouguer]] and [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]].<ref name="Mccormmach2012">{{cite book|author=Russell Mccormmach|title=Weighing the World: The Reverend John Michell of Thornhill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eMkgfKIdXIC&pg=PA129|access-date=12 May 2013|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2022-0|pages=129–31|archive-date=17 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617035654/https://books.google.com/books?id=9eMkgfKIdXIC&pg=PA129|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Mathematics and physics ===
[[File:Christiaan-huygens4.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Christiaan Huygens by [[Bernard Vaillant]] (1686).]]
In mathematics, Huygens mastered the methods of ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek geometry]], particularly the work of Archimedes, and was an adept user of the analytic geometry and infinitesimal techniques of Descartes and Fermat.<ref name=":11">{{Cite journal|last=Dijksterhuis|first=E. J.|date=1953|title=Christiaan Huygens; an address delivered at the annual meeting of the Holland Society of Sciences at Haarlem, May 13th, 1950, on the occasion of the completion of Huygens's Collected Works|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13082531/|journal=Centaurus; International Magazine of the History of Science and Medicine|volume=2|issue=4|pages=265–282|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1953.tb00409.x|pmid=13082531|bibcode=1953Cent....2..265D|access-date=12 August 2021|archive-date=12 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210812151101/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13082531/|url-status=live}}</ref> His mathematical style can be best described as geometrical infinitesimal analysis of curves and of motion. Drawing inspiration and imagery from mechanics, it remained pure mathematics in form.<ref name=":15" /> Huygens brought this type of geometrical analysis to a close, as more mathematicians turned away from classical geometry to the [[calculus]] for handling infinitesimals, limit processes, and motion.<ref name=":9" />

Huygens was moreover able to fully employ mathematics to answer questions of physics. Often this entailed introducing a simple [[Mathematical model|model]] for describing a complicated situation, then analyzing it starting from simple arguments to their logical consequences, developing the necessary mathematics along the way. As he wrote at the end of a draft of ''De vi Centrifuga'':<ref name=":10" />

{{Blockquote|text=Whatever you will have supposed not impossible either concerning gravity or motion or any other matter, if then you prove something concerning the magnitude of a line, surface, or body, it will be true; as for instance, Archimedes on the [[quadrature of the parabola]], where the tendency of heavy objects has been assumed to act through parallel lines.}}

Huygens favoured [[Axiomatic system|axiomatic]] presentations of his results, which require rigorous methods of geometric demonstration: although he allowed levels of uncertainty in the selection of primary axioms and hypotheses, the proofs of theorems derived from these could never be in doubt.<ref name=":10" /> Huygens's style of publication exerted an influence in Newton's presentation of his own [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|major]] [[Opticks|works]].<ref>Elzinga, A. (1972). ''On a research program in early modern physics''. Akademiförlaget.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cohen |first=I.

Besides the application of mathematics to physics and physics to mathematics, Huygens relied on mathematics as methodology, specifically its ability to generate new knowledge about the world.<ref name=":18">{{Cite journal|last=Gijsbers|first=V.|date=2003|title=Christiaan Huygens and the scientific revolution|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2004ESASP1278..171C|url-status=live|journal=Titan - from Discovery to Encounter|volume=1278|publisher=ESA Publications Division|pages=171–178|bibcode=2004ESASP1278..171C|access-date=12 August 2021|archive-date=12 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210812151101/http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2004ESASP1278..171C}}</ref> Unlike Galileo, who used mathematics primarily as rhetoric or synthesis, Huygens consistently employed mathematics as a way to discover and develop theories covering various phenomena and insisted that the reduction of the physical to the geometrical satisfy exacting standards of fit between the real and the ideal.<ref name=":29" /> In demanding such mathematical tractability and precision, Huygens set an example for eighteenth-century scientists such as [[Johann Bernoulli]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]].<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":30">{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=G.

Although never intended for publication, Huygens made use of algebraic expressions to represent physical entities in a handful of his manuscripts on collisions.<ref name=":13" /> This would make him one of the first to employ mathematical formulae to describe relationships in physics, as it is done today.<ref name=":14" /> Huygens also came close to the modern idea of [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] while working on his ''Dioptrica,'' though he never used the notion outside geometrical optics.<ref>Malet, A. (1996). ''From indivisibles to infinitesimals'' (pp. 20-22). Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.</ref>

==== Later influence ====
Huygens's standing as the greatest scientist in Europe was eclipsed by Newton's at the end of the seventeenth century, despite the fact that, as [[Hugh Aldersey-Williams]] notes, "Huygens's achievement exceeds that of Newton in some important respects".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Aldersey-Williams |first=H. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7n7VDwAAQBAJ&q=In+the+case+of+two+bodies+which+meet%2C+the+quantity+obtained+by+taking+the+sum+of+their+masses+multiplied+by+the+squares+of+their+velocities+will+be+found+to+beequal+before+and+after+the+collision.%E2%80%99&pg=PP86 |title=Dutch Light: Christiaan Huygens and the Making of Science in Europe |date=2020 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |isbn=978-1-5098-9332-4 |page=14 |language=en |access-date=28 August 2021}}</ref> Although his journal publications anticipated the form of the modern [[Scientific literature|scientific article]],<ref name=":33" /> his persistent classicism and reluctance to publish his work did much to diminish his influence in the aftermath of the Scientific Revolution, as adherents of Leibniz’ calculus and Newton's physics took centre stage.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":11" />

Huygens's analyses of curves that satisfy certain physical properties, such as the [[cycloid]], led to later studies of many other such curves like the caustic, the [[Brachistochrone curve|brachistochrone]], the sail curve, and the catenary.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":16" /> His application of mathematics to physics, such as in his studies of impact and birefringence, would inspire new developments in mathematical physics and [[Classical mechanics|rational mechanics]] in the following centuries (albeit in the new language of the calculus).<ref name=":6" /> Additionally, Huygens developed the oscillating timekeeping mechanisms, the pendulum and the balance spring, that have been used ever since in mechanical [[watch]]es and [[clock]]s. These were the first reliable timekeepers fit for [[Scientific instrument|scientific use]] (e.g., to make accurate measurements of the [[Synodic day|inequality of the solar day]], which was not possible before).<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":29" /> His work in this area foreshadowed the union of [[applied mathematics]] with [[mechanical engineering]] in the centuries that followed.<ref name=":20">{{Cite thesis|title=Christiaan Huygens: a foreign inventor in the Court of Louis XIV, his role as a forerunner of mechanical engineering|url=https://oro.open.ac.uk/57983/|publisher=The Open University|date=1996|degree=Phd|language=en|first=M.
