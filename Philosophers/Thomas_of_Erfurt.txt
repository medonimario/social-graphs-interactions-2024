'''Thomas of Erfurt''' ({{floruit|{{circa|1300}}}}) was a German philosopher, the most important of the so-called ''[[Modistae]]''. He was probably a native of [[Erfurt]]. He had some connection to the [[University of Paris]] as a teacher or student. He later taught at [[St Severus' Church, Erfurt|St Severus' Church]] and the [[Schottenkirche, Erfurt|Schottenkirche]] in Erfurt.{{sfn|Zupko|2019}}

Thomas wrote at least six works.{{sfn|Zupko|2019}} His major work, ''Tractatus de modis significandi seu Grammatica speculativa'', was often misattributed to [[John Duns Scotus]] until 1922.{{sfn|Beuchot|2002}} All the early manuscript evidence supports its attribution to Thomas. It was written before 1310. Attributed to Scotus, it was one of the subjects of [[Martin Heidegger]]'s 1916 doctoral thesis.{{sfn|Zupko|2019}} [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] borrowed the name of the first branch of his system of logic, "speculative grammar", from Thomas.{{sfn|Bellucci|2018|p=6}} The ''Grammatica speculativa'' has been published with English translation and commentary by Godfrey Bursill-Hall (Longman, 1972).

Thomas' other works include commentaries on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''[[Isagoge]]'', [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' and ''[[On Interpretation]]'', and the anonymous ''[[Liber sex principiorum]]''. He also wrote a pedagogical poem on grammar, ''Commentarius in carmen ‘Fundamentum puerorum’''.{{sfn|Zupko|2019}}
