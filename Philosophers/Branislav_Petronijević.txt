'''Branislav "Brana" Petronijević''' (sometimes styled as '''Petronievics''') ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Бранислав "Брана" Петронијевић; 6 April 1875 – 4 March 1954) was a [[Serbia]]n [[philosopher]] and [[Paleontology|paleontologist]].

His major work is the two-volume ''Prinzipien der Metaphysik'' (''Principles of Metaphysics'', [[Heidelberg]], 1904–1911), in which he outlines his original metaphysical system – a synthesis of [[Baruch Spinoza|Baruch Spinoza's]] [[monism]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz's]] [[Monadology|monadological]] pluralism into what he called "monopluralism". Influenced by [[George Berkeley]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]], Petronijević held that our immediate experience is the source of basic logical and metaphysical axioms – what he called "empirio-rationalist" epistemology.<ref name = "routledge">{{cite book |last1=Lazović |first1=Živan |last2=Pavković |first2=Aleksandar |title='Academic philosophy before the Second World War In: South Slavs, philosophy of' In: Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=1998 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |location=London |isbn=0415187125 |url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/overview/south-slavs-philosophy-of/v-1/sections/academic-philosophy-before-the-second-world-war |access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Branislav Petronijević was born in the small village of [[Sovljak (Ub)|Sovljak]], near [[Ub, Serbia]], on 6 April (25 March, [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) 1875, the son of a Marko Jeremić, a [[Theology|theologian]]. The last name Petronijević stems from Branislav's grandfather, Petronije Jeremić, a local priest. His father changed Branislav's last name to reduce pressure at school, as the Jeremić family were prominent supporters of the exiled [[Karađorđević dynasty]].

He studied at the [[Valjevo Gymnasium]] and the [[Grande école]] in [[Belgrade]] (the Belgrade Higher School).

===Education and early work===
In 1894, Petronijević went to [[Vienna]] to pursue a degree in medicine, on a scholarship awarded by the Tamnava [[srez]]. Petronijević joined the Philosophical Society of the [[University of Vienna]] and studied under [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. After three semesters in Vienna he enrolled at the [[University of Leipzig]], where he studied philosophy under [[Johannes Volkelt]], [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], and [[Ernst Mach]]. There, he wrote ''Der ontologische Beweis für das Dasein des Absoluten'' (''The Ontological Proof for the Existence of the Absolute'') in 1897, and successfully defended his thesis ''Der Satz vom Grunde'' (''The Principle of Reason'') in 1898. Having studied during this time under [[Wilhelm Wundt]], Petronijević later published several works in [[experimental psychology]] on the observation of the transparent and on the depth and observation of compound colours. In Leipzig, Petronijević received financial help from former bishop [[Nikanor Ružičić]], with whom he practiced the [[German language]].

In 1898 he was given the title of [[docent]] at the Belgrade Higher School at the request of professor [[Ljubomir Nedić]].<ref name="gledista">{{cite journal |last1=Milosavljević |first1=Boris |title=Nov pogled na delo Branislava Petronijevića |access-date=13 May 2019 |journal=Gledišta |date=1999 |volume=1/2 |issue=40 |pages=269–279 |language=Serbian |issn=0017-1166 |url=https://www.academia.edu/3271222}}</ref> He taught the German language and philosophical [[propaedeutics]] at the [[Third Belgrade Gymnasium]]. Petronijević was promoted to the post of [[associate professor]] in 1899, and then [[Professor (highest academic rank)|full professor]] in 1903. Three years later when the school developed into the [[University of Belgrade]], Petronijević was demoted back to associate professor. He was simultaneously elected correspondent member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Serbian Royal Academy]] on 3 February 1906. Petronijević found this humiliating, and declined the post, his decision coming into effect in 1910. During this time, Petronijević also taught [[art theory]] at [[Rista Vukanović|Rista]] and [[Beta Vukanović|Beta Vukanović's]] Serbian Art School in Belgrade.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Novakov |first1=Anna |title=Diplomatic Ties: Pavle Beljanski, Patronage and Serbian Women Artists |date=2012 |publisher=Fibonacci Academic Press |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-1-105-57721-5 |pages=45–46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G86dAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 |access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref>

It was during this period that he thought out and developed what is distinctive in his philosophical doctrine. His two major works in metaphysics, ''Prinzipen der Metaphysik'' (''Principles of Metaphysics'') and ''Die typischen Geometrien und das Unendliche'' (''The Typical Geometries and the Infinite''), were published during this period.

===World War I===
At the outbreak of [[World War I]] he turned to journalism, becoming a war correspondent for the Serbian War Office Press Bureau, induced by [[Dragutin Dimitrijević|Dragutin Dimitrijević "Apis"]], his childhood friend. In 1915 he joined the [[Serbian army's retreat through Albania]]. After reaching Greece, he was sent first to [[Rome]] where he stayed for four months. After Rome, Petronijević spent several months in [[Paris]], where he taught two courses at the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]], on universal evolution and on the value of life.

Finally, he spent the longest part of the war in [[London]] with the Serbian Legation, along with politician [[Nikola Pašić]], geographer [[Jovan Cvijić]], professors [[Bogdan Popović]] and his brother [[Pavle Popović]]. There, Petronijević worked on an English translation of ''Theoria Philosophiæ Naturalis'' (''A Theory of Natural Philosophy'') by [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], together with [[Čedomilj Mijatović]] and [[Nikolaj Velimirović]]. The 1763 Venetian edition of the book was translated by James Mark Child, and finally published in 1922 by the [[Open Court Publishing Company]], funded in part by the newly created [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. Petronijević wrote the preface, titled ''Life of Roger Joseph Boscovich''.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Child | first = James Mark | title = A Theory of Natural Philosophy | location = Chicago, London | publisher = Open Court Publishing Company | year = 1922 | page = [https://archive.org/details/theoryofnaturalp00boscrich/page/11 11] | url = https://archive.org/details/theoryofnaturalp00boscrich}}</ref> Parts of it were severely criticized by [[Vladimir Varićak]] in 1925 for various factual errors, among other things for asserting Boscovich's exclusively Serbian ethnicity, and listing his birth date inaccurately.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = [[Rad (journal)|Rad]] | language = Croatian | author = Vladimir Varićak | author-link = Vladimir Varićak | title = U povodu državnog izdanja Boškovićeva djela "Theoria philosophiae naturalis" | publisher = [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] | date = 1925-01-23 | pages = 161-168 (167-174) | url = http://dizbi.hazu.hr/object/view/zm9BcO2vEA | access-date = 2019-02-25}}</ref>

While in London, Petronijević met with [[Bertrand Russell]], who wrote:

{{blockquote|A man who impressed me, not so much by his ability as by his resolute absorption in philosophy even under the most arduous circumstances, was the only Yugoslav philosopher of our time, whose name was Branislav Petroniević. I met him only once, in the year 1917. The only language we both knew was German and so we had to use it, although it caused people in the streets to look at us with suspicion. The Serbs had recently carried out their heroic retreat before the German invaders, and I was anxious to get a first-hand account of this retreat from him, but he only wanted to expound his doctrine that the number of points in space is finite and can be estimated by considerations derived from the theory of numbers. The consequence of this difference in our interests was a somewhat curious conversation. I said, "Were you in the great retreat?" and he replied, "Yes, but you see the way to calculate the number of points in space is." I said, "Were you on foot?" and he said, "Yes, you see the number must be a prime." I said, "Did you not try to get a horse?" and he said, "I started on a horse, but I fell off, and it should not be difficult to find out what prime." In spite of all my efforts, I could get nothing further from him about anything so trivial as the Great War. I admired his capacity for intellectual detachment from the accidents of his corporeal existence, in which I felt that few ancient Stoics could have rivalled him. After the First War he was employed by the Yugoslav Government to bring out a magnificent edition of the eighteenth-century Yugoslav philosopher Boscovich, but what happened to him after that I do not know.|Bertrand Russell<ref>{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Bertrand |title=Portraits from Memory and other Essays |date=1956 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |pages=28–29 |isbn=9780671203788 |edition=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aV4fAAAAMAAJ |access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref>}}

===Later life===
After the war he left London and went back to his teaching post at the University of Belgrade, where he was appointed again appointed full professor in 1919. On 16 February 1920, he was elected into the Serbian Royal Academy.

From 1918 to 1922, Petronijević notably mentored [[Ksenija Atanasijević]], later a prominent Serbian female intellectual and early Serbian [[Feminism|feminist]] writer.

During the [[Interbellum]], Petronijević was an active participant in European philosophy, and considered himself a worthy philosopher who transcended his "parochial" limitations. He deemed himself one of the 15 "great philosophers" of history, along with [[Aristotle]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. Beside "great philosophers", Petronijević mentions "significant philosophers" and "philosophic writers".<ref name = "arhe">{{cite journal |last1=Sadžakov |first1=Slobodan |title=PODSEĆANJA - Branislav Petronijević |journal=Arhe |date=2004 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=243–246 |doi=10.19090/arhe.2004.2 |url=http://epub.ff.uns.ac.rs/index.php/arhe/article/download/411/426/ |access-date=25 February 2019 |publisher=Filozofski fakultet, Odsek za filozofiju |location=Novi Sad |doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 |language=Serbian |archive-date=26 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226172749/http://epub.ff.uns.ac.rs/index.php/arhe/article/download/411/426/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Petronijević retired from the university in 1927. He served as secretary of the Serbian Royal Academy from February 1932 to February 1933 and founded the Serbian Philosophical Society in 1938, together with [[Vladimir Dvorniković]], [[Justin Popović]] and others. The third volume of his ''Principles of Metaphysics'' was destroyed in an air raid in April 1941. He held lectures at the German Scientific Institute during the [[World War II in Yugoslavia|occupation of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Popović |first1=Nikola |title=Rad Univerziteta u toku prošle godine |work=Obnova |date=15 July 1943}}</ref> After the war, he traveled to France several times and started writing poetry.<ref name = "arhe" /> Petronijević was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1941 and 1947.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nomination Database |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/redirector/?redir=archive/show_people.php&id=7182 |website=www.nobelprize.org |access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref>

Petronijević died in a Belgrade's Hotel Balkan on 4 March 1954. He was 78. He never married.

==Writings==
===Philosophy===
Petronijević considered himself a "born metaphysician" and devoted himself to constructing his own metaphysical system. Although original, his system grew out of the nineteenth-century empirical metaphysics of [[Hermann Lotze]], [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann|Eduard von Hartmann]] and Petronijević's teacher, [[Johannes Volkelt]].

The motto of Petronijević's principal work ''Prinzipien der Metaphysik'' (''Principles of Metaphysics'', 1904), reads: "''Exact mathematical notions are a key to the solution of the world's enigma''".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Izetbegović |first1=Alija |title=Izetbegović of Bosnia-Herzegovina: Notes from Prison, 1983-1988 |date=2002 |publisher=Praeger Publishers |location=Westport, CT |isbn=0275972879 |page=147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ur-AFA4gtzsC |access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref> In it, he constructed a new geometry in which time and space are discrete, not continuous. Petronijević argued that being consists of simple, discrete qualitative points which are mutually related in various ways to form a unity. He outlined two types of these simple points – real "central points" (''Mittelpunkte'') and unreal "intermediate points" (''Zwischenpunkte''). The world as a manifold is possible only because each pair of real points of being is separated by an unreal point constituting an "act of negation", without which being would be absolutely homogeneous.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lazović |first1=Živan |title=Čemu prekrajanje istorije srpske filozofije? |journal=Theoria |date=2015 |volume=2 |issue=58 |pages=143–160 |doi=10.2298/THEO1502143L |url=http://doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0351-2274/2015/0351-22741502143L.pdf |access-date=13 May 2019 |language=Serbian}}</ref><ref name="gledista" /> Petronijević regarded the principle of negation as "the absolute principle of the world". His metaphysical system was thus conceived as a synthesis of [[Baruch Spinoza|Baruch Spinoza's]] [[monism]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz's]] [[Monadology|monadological]] pluralism into what he called "monopluralism".<ref name = "routledge" />

He claimed that the basic task of metaphysics was to explain the structure of the "world of multitude, diversity, and change" as the "pre-evidence" of the directly given empirical and transcendental reality. Petronijević's view was essentially idealistic, since he held that absolutely unconscious atoms are impossible and that the immortal soul is a conscious [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]. He argued that the universe was evolving from a condition of instability towards one of absolute stability, in which there would be equilibrium in the relation between particular elements or monads and the universal substance which underlies them. This last is the subject of a special division of philosophy, beyond metaphysics, which Petronijević called "hypermetaphysics".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Robert |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=Stuart |editor2-last=Collinson |editor2-first=Diane |editor3-last=Wilkinson |editor3-first=Robert |title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134927968 |pages=613–614 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZQqBgAAQBAJ |access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref>

His original "empirio-rationalist" epistemology was based on a rather complex derivation of logical laws from [[Empirical evidence|immediate experience]]. For Petronijević, our immediate experience not only presents reality as is, but is also the source of basic logical and metaphysical axioms – all are derived from the data of immediate experience.<ref name = "routledge" /> Petronijević rejected [[Immanuel Kant|Immanuel Kant’s]] [[phenomenalism]] and denied the distinction between the [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] and [[Noumenon|noumenal]]. He held that the all contents of the mind are real and thus denied the existence of pure representation, claiming that all representations are in fact real. For Petronijević, thought and being are identical, and [[Apodicticity|apodictic]] knowledge of being itself is possible. He considered the [[principle of sufficient reason]] the fundamental law of true knowledge.

Petronijević upheld an ethical theory of transcendental optimism and [[free will]]. He argued that "it is not possible to live with the belief that there is no free will". Since Petronijević's epistemology does not allow for the existence of an absolute illusion, the subjective experience of free will implies its existence in reality.<ref name="gledista" /> He devoted a number of studies to [[aesthetics]], particularly in the work of [[Petar II Petrović Njegoš]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].

===Natural science===
[[File:Archaeopteryx timeline.svg|thumb|Timeline of ''Archaeopteryx'' discoveries until 2007]]
From 1917, Petronijević analyzed the [[Specimens of Archaeopteryx|Berlin specimen]] of the ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''.

In 1921, discovered the pelvis of the Berlin specimen was markedly different from that of the London specimen. Namely, the Berlin specimen entirely lacked a [[pubic symphysis]]. Petronijević erected the genus ''Archaeornis'' and was in favor of assigning a new species to the Berlin specimen, ''Archaeornis siemensii'', after the fossil's generous donor [[Werner von Siemens]].<ref name="Petronievics1921" /> [[Gavin de Beer]], however, disputed this difference, claiming it could be entirely accounted for by deformation of the specimens during preservation, a conclusion generally accepted by later paleontologists.<ref name="deBeer1954" />

In 1925, Petronijević attempted to reconstruct the [[sternum]] as being keeled. The sternum identified in the London specimen, by contrast, appeared unkeeled and this discrepancy, too, led Petronijević to classify the Berlin specimen as a different genus, ''Archaeornis''. Wellnhofer (1993) and Tischlinger & Unwin (2004) identified the triangular structure as indeed part of the sternum, albeit minimally ossified (mostly cartilagenous). This supported the idea that the Berlin ''Archaeopteryx'' was not a full-grown individual at the time of its death, and instead represents an immature animal.<ref name="Wellnhofer1993" /><ref name="Tischlinger2004" />

After the extensive examination of five newly discovered early bird specimens all of his [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] interpretations were abandoned, and only his discoveries of the ''Archaeopteryx'' skeleton parts remained.

In 1923, Petronijević added a new species, ''M. ancestrale'' to the genus ''[[Moeritherium]]'', excluding a skull and a mandible from those attributed to ''M. lyonsi'' on the basis of some cranial characters observed on the [[Palatine bone|palatine]] and [[Occipital bone|occipital]]. In his revision of the genus, {{ill|Heinz Tobien|de|Heinz Tobien}} considered the skull differences mentioned by Petronijević as intraspecific and sex-related variations and synonymised ''M. gracile'', ''M. lyonsi'' and ''M. ancestrale'', keeping only one species for the [[Qasr el Sagha Formation]] under the name ''M. lyonsi''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Delmer |first1=Cyrille |last2=Mahboubi |first2=Mohamed |last3=Tabuce |first3=Rodolphe |last4=Tassy |first4=Pascal |title=A new species of Moeritherium (Proboscidea, Mammalia) From the Eocene of Algeria: new perspectives on the ancestral morphotype of the genus |journal=Palaeontology |date=2006 |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=421–434 |url=https://www.academia.edu/7678317 |access-date=19 February 2019 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00548.x|bibcode=2006Palgy..49..421D |s2cid=83579067 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Petronijević's contributions to the philosophy of [[natural sciences]] are collected in his compilation ''L'évolution universelle. Exposé des preuves et des lois de l`évolution mondiale et des évolutions particulières'' (''Universal evolution. Presentation of Evidence and Laws of Global Evolution and Particular Developments'', 1921). Among them there are the explanation of [[Dollo's law of irreversibility]], first described in ''Zakon nepovratne evolucije'' (''Law of Irreversible Evolution'', 1920), and the introduction of his own ''Law of Non-correlative Evolution'' with which he describes the [[mosaic evolution]] in ''Archaeopteryx''.

Among his most notable contributions to the logical foundations of mathematics are his work on typical geometries, on the problem of the infinitude of space, the [[three-body problem]], on [[difference quotient]]s, and on [[mathematical induction]]. In psychology, he developed theories about the observation of the transparent and on the depth and observation of compound colours.
