Uniquely among 20th-century Chinese leaders, Sun is revered by both the [[Republic of China]] on Taiwan (where he is officially the "[[Father of the Nation]]") and by the [[People's Republic of China]] (where he is officially the "Forerunner of the Revolution") for his instrumental role in the [[1911 Revolution]] that successfully overthrew the [[Qing dynasty]].<ref name="Tung1" />

Educated overseas, Sun is considered one of the most important leaders of modern China, but his political life featured constant struggles and frequent periods of exile. After the success of the 1911 Revolution, Sun quickly resigned as president of the nascent Republic of China, relinquishing the position to the general [[Yuan Shikai]] and ultimately going into exile in Japan. He later returned to found a revolutionary government in [[Southern China]] to challenge the [[Warlord Era|warlords]] who controlled much of the country following Yuan's death. In 1923, Sun invited representatives of the [[Communist International]] to [[Guangzhou]] to reorganize the KMT, resulting in the brittle [[First United Front]] with the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP). He did not live to see his party unify the country under his successor, [[Chiang Kai-shek]], in the [[Northern Expedition]]. Now residing in Beijing, Sun died of gallbladder cancer in 1925.

A vital component of Sun's legacy is his political philosophy, known as the [[Three Principles of the People]]: the peoples' independence from foreign domination, their rights, and their livelihood.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Three Principles of the People |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Three-Principles-of-the-People}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Schoppa |first=R.

== Religious views and Christian baptism ==
In the early 1880s, Sun Mei had sent his brother to ʻIolani School, which was under the supervision of the [[Church of Hawaii]] and directed by an [[Anglican]] prelate, [[Alfred Willis]], with the language of instruction being English. At the school, the young Sun first came in contact with Christianity.

Sun was later [[baptism|baptized]] in Hong Kong (on 4 May 1884) by [[The Reverend|Rev.]] [[Charles Robert Hager]]<ref>"...At present there are some seven members in the interior belonging to our mission, and two here, one I baptized last Sabbath, a young man who is attending the Government Central School.

During the Qing-dynasty rebellion around 1888, Sun was in Hong Kong with a group of revolutionary thinkers, nicknamed the [[Four Bandits]], at the [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]].<ref name="bard">Bard, Solomon.

In 1895, China suffered a serious defeat during the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. There were two types of responses.

== First uprising and exile ==
=== First Guangzhou Uprising ===

[[File:Letter sun yat sen.PNG|thumb|Letter from Sun Yat-sen to [[James Cantlie]] announcing to him that he has assumed the Presidency of the Provisional Republican Government of China, dated 21 January 1912]]
In the second year of the establishment of the Revive China Society, on 26 October 1895, the group planned and launched the [[Xinhai Revolution#First Guangzhou Uprising|First Guangzhou uprising]] against the Qing in [[Guangzhou]].<ref name="gtong146" /> [[Yeung Ku-wan]] directed the uprising starting from Hong Kong.<ref name="yang-bio" /> However, plans were leaked out, and more than 70 members, including [[Lu Haodong]], were captured by the Qing government. The uprising was a failure. Sun received financial support mostly from his brother, who sold most of his 12,000 acres of ranch and cattle in Hawaii.<ref name="Maui" /> Additionally, members of his family and relatives of Sun would take refuge at the home of his brother Sun Mei at Kamaole in [[Kula, Hawaii|Kula]], [[Maui]].<ref name="Maui" /><ref name="KHON2SunMei" /><ref name="MauiSunPark" /><ref name="MauiCountySunPark" /><ref name="MauiMagazine" />

=== Exile in Japan ===
While in exile in [[London]] in 1896, Sun raised money for his revolutionary party and to support uprisings in China. While the events leading up to it are unclear, Sun Yat-sen was detained at the [[Embassy of China, London|Chinese Legation in London]], where the Chinese secret service planned to smuggle him back to China to execute him for his revolutionary actions.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sun-Yat-sen |title = Sun Yat-sen {{!}} Chinese leader |website = Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date = 31 March 2018}}</ref> He was released after 12 days by the efforts of [[James Cantlie]], ''[[The Globe (London newspaper)|The Globe]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', and the [[Foreign Office]], which left Sun a hero in the United Kingdom.{{NoteTag|Contrary to a popular legend, Sun entered the Legation voluntarily although he was prevented from leaving.

Cantlie, his former teacher, was refused a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' because of the Legation's [[diplomatic immunity]], but he began a campaign through ''[[The Times]]''. Through diplomatic channels, the [[British Foreign Office]] persuaded the Legation to release Sun.<ref>{{cite book |title = The Origins of a Heroic Image: SunYat Sen in London, 1896–1987 |last = Wong |first = J.Y. |year = 1986 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location=Hong Kong}}

Sun traveled by way of [[Canada]] to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] to begin his exile there. He arrived in [[Yokohama]] on 16 August 1897 and met with the Japanese politician [[Tōten Miyazaki]]. Most Japanese who actively worked with Sun were motivated by a [[pan-Asian]] opposition to [[Western imperialism in Asia|Western imperialism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.japanfocus.org/_Sato_Kazuo-Sun_Yat_sen_s_1911_Revolution_had_Its_Seeds_in_Tokyo |title=JapanFocus |publisher=Old.japanfocus.org |access-date=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316134631/http://old.japanfocus.org/_Sato_Kazuo-Sun_Yat_sen_s_1911_Revolution_had_Its_Seeds_in_Tokyo |archive-date=16 March 2012 }}</ref> In Japan, Sun also met [[Mariano Ponce]], a diplomat of the [[First Philippine Republic]].<ref>Thornber, Karen Laura. (2009). ''Empire of Texts in Motion: Chinese, Korean, and Taiwanese Transculturations of Japanese Literature''. Harvard University Press. p. 404.</ref>

During the [[Philippine Revolution]] and the [[Philippine–American War]], Sun helped Ponce procure weapons that had been salvaged from the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and ship the weapons to the Philippines. By helping the Philippine Republic, Sun hoped that the Filipinos would retain their independence so that he could be sheltered in the country in staging another Chinese revolution. However, as the war ended in July 1902, the United States emerged victorious from a bitter three-year war against the Republic. Therefore, Sun did not have the opportunity to ally with the Philippines in his revolution in China.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ocampo|first1=Ambeth|title=Looking Back 2|date=2010|publisher=Anvil Publishing|location=Pasig|pages=8–11}}</ref>

== From failed uprisings to revolution ==
=== Huizhou Uprising ===
On 22 October 1900, Sun ordered the launch of the [[Xinhai Revolution#Huizhou Uprising|Huizhou Uprising]] to attack [[Huizhou]] and provincial authorities in Guangdong.<ref>Gao, James Zheng. (2009). ''Historical dictionary of modern China (1800–1949)''. Scarecrow Press. {{ISBN|978-0810849303}}. Chronology section.</ref> That came five years after the failed Guangzhou Uprising. This time, Sun appealed to the [[triad (organized crime)|triads]] for help.<ref>[[#Bergère|Bergère]]: 86</ref> The uprising was another failure.

=== Getting support from Siamese Chinese ===
In 1903, Sun made a secret trip to [[Bangkok]] in which he sought funds for his cause in Southeast Asia. His loyal followers published newspapers, providing invaluable support to the dissemination of his revolutionary principles and ideals among [[Siamese Chinese]] in [[Siam]]. In Bangkok, Sun visited [[Yaowarat Road]], in the city's [[Chinatown, Bangkok|Chinatown]]. On that street, Sun gave a speech claiming that [[Overseas Chinese]] were "the Mother of the Revolution." He also met the local Chinese merchant Seow Houtseng,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dspace.wul.waseda.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2065/39825/3/AjiaTaiheiyoTokyu_21_Murashima.pdf|title=The Origins of Chinese Nationalism in Thailand|author=Eiji Murashima|publisher=Journal of Asia-Pacific Studies (Waseda University)|access-date=30 March 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330180058/https://dspace.wul.waseda.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2065/39825/3/AjiaTaiheiyoTokyu_21_Murashima.pdf|archive-date=30 March 2017}}</ref> who sent financial support to him.

Sun's speech on Yaowarat Road was commemorated by the street later being named "Sun Yat Sen Street" or "Soi Sun Yat Sen" ({{langx|th|ซอยซุนยัตเซ็น}}) in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Lim|url=http://www.tour-bangkok-legacies.com/soi-sun-yat-sen.html |title=Soi Sun Yat Sen the legacy of a revolutionary|publisher=Tour Bangkok Legacies |access-date=30 March 2017}}</ref>

===Getting support from American Chinese===
According to Lee Yun-ping, chairman of the Chinese historical society, Sun needed a certificate to enter the United States since the [[Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]] would have otherwise blocked him.<ref name="sfworldjournal">{{cite news |script-title=zh:孫中山思想 3學者演說精采 |url=http://sf.worldjournal.com/view/full_sf/12160552/article-孫中山思想-3學者演說精采?instance=top_rec |work=World journal |date=4 March 2011 |access-date=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513181852/http://sf.worldjournal.com/view/full_sf/12160552/article-%E5%AD%AB%E4%B8%AD%E5%B1%B1%E6%80%9D%E6%83%B3-3%E5%AD%B8%E8%80%85%E6%BC%94%E8%AA%AA%E7%B2%BE%E9%87%87?instance=top_rec |archive-date=13 May 2013}}</ref>

In March 1904, while residing in [[Kula, Hawaii|Kula]], [[Maui]], Sun Yat-sen obtained a Certificate of Hawaiian Birth, issued by the [[Territory of Hawaii]], stating that "he was born in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] on the 24th day of November, A.D. 1870."<ref name="Certificate of Live Birth in Hawaii">{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/9830547/Sun-Yatsen-Certification-of-Live-Birth-in-Hawaii |title=Sun Yat-sen: Certification of Live Birth in Hawaii |publisher=[[Scribd]] |location=San Francisco, CA, US |access-date=15 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=smys00honu /> He renounced it after it served its purpose to circumvent the Chinese Exclusion Act.<ref name="smys00honu">Smyser, A.A.

On 6 April 1904, on his first attempt to enter the United States, Sun Yat-sen landed in [[San Francisco]]. He was detained and faced with possible deportation.<ref name="sfworldjournal" /> Sun, represented by the law firm of Ralston & Siddons, based in [[Washington DC]], filed an appeal with the Commissioner-General of Immigration on 26 April 1904. On 28 April 1904, the acting secretary of the [[Department of Commerce and Labor]] in a four-page decision contained in the case file, set aside the order of deportation and ordered the Commissioner of Immigration in San Francisco to "permit the said Sun Yat-sen to land." Sun was then freed to embark on his fundraising tour in the United States.<ref name="sfworldjournal" />

===Unifying forces of Tongmenghui in Tokyo===
{{Main|Tongmenghui}}
[[File:The document bearing Sun Yat Sen's official seal.png|thumb|A letter with Sun's seal commencing the [[Tongmenghui]] in Hong Kong]]
In 1904, Sun Yat-sen came about with the goal "to expel the [[Tatar]] barbarians (specifically, the Manchu), to revive [[Names of China#Zhongguo and Zhonghua|Zhonghua]], to establish a Republic, and to [[Land reform|distribute land]] equally among the people" ({{lang|zh-hant|驅除韃虜, 恢復中華, 創立民國, 平均地權}}).<ref name="chinahistvol1">計秋楓, 朱慶葆.

These Principles included the principle of nationalism (minzu, {{lang|zh|民族}}), of democracy (minquan, {{lang|zh-hant|民權}}), and of welfare (minsheng, {{lang|zh|民生}}).<ref name="chinahistvol1" />

On 20 August 1905, Sun joined forces with revolutionary Chinese students studying in Tokyo to form the unified group [[Tongmenghui]] (United League), which sponsored uprisings in China.<ref name="chinahistvol1" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countriesquest.com/asia/china/history/imperial_china/the_manchu_qing_dynasty_1644-1911/internal_threats.htm |title=Internal Threats&nbsp;– The Manchu Qing Dynasty (1644–1911)&nbsp;– Imperial China&nbsp;– History&nbsp;– China&nbsp;– Asia |publisher=Countriesquest.com |access-date=26 September 2011}}</ref> By 1906 the number of Tongmenghui members reached 963.<ref name="chinahistvol1" />

=== Getting support from Malayan Chinese ===

Sun's notability and popularity extended beyond the [[Greater China]] region, particularly to [[Nanyang (geographical region)|Nanyang]] (Southeast Asia), where a large concentration of [[overseas Chinese]] resided in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] ([[Malaysia]] and Singapore). In Singapore, he met the local Chinese merchants Teo Eng Hock ({{lang|zh-hant|張永福}}), Tan Chor Nam ({{lang|zh-hant|陳楚楠}}) and Lim Nee Soon ({{lang|zh-hant|林義順}}), which mark the commencement of direct support from the [[Nanyang (region)|Nanyang]] Chinese. The Singapore chapter of the Tongmenghui was established on 6 April 1906,<ref name="yanq">Yan, Qinghuang. (2008). ''The Chinese in Southeast Asia and beyond: socioeconomic and political dimensions''.

After founding the Tongmenghui, Sun advocated the establishment of the ''[[Chong Shing Yit Pao]]'' as the alliance's mouthpiece to promote revolutionary ideas. Later, he initiated the establishment of reading clubs across Singapore and Malaysia to disseminate revolutionary ideas by the lower class through public readings of newspaper stories. The United Chinese Library, founded on 8 August 1910, was one such reading club, first set up at leased property on the second floor of the Wan He Salt Traders in North Boat Quay.<ref>{{cite web |title=United Chinese Library |url=https://roots.sg/Content/Places/historic-sites/united-chinese-library |website=Roots |publisher=National Heritage Board |access-date=15 September 2019 |archive-date=3 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203123922/https://roots.sg/Content/Places/historic-sites/united-chinese-library |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The first actual United Chinese Library building was built between 1908 and 1911 below Fort Canning, on 51 Armenian Street, commenced operations in 1912. The library was set up as a part of the 50 reading rooms by the Chinese republicans to serve as an information station and liaison point for the revolutionaries. In 1987, the library was moved to its present site at Cantonment Road.

=== Uprisings ===
On 1 December 1907, Sun led the [[Xinhai Revolution#Zhennanguan Uprising|Zhennanguan Uprising]] against the Qing at [[Friendship Pass]], which is the border between [[Guangxi]] and [[Vietnam]].<ref name="Khoo">Khoo, Salma Nasution.

=== Anti-Sun factionalism ===
Because of the failures, Sun's leadership was challenged by elements from within the Tongmenghui who wished to remove him as leader. In Tokyo, members from the recently merged [[Guangfuhui|Restoration society]] raised doubts about Sun's credentials.<ref name="yanq" /> [[Tao Chengzhang]] and [[Zhang Binglin]] publicly denounced Sun in an open leaflet, "A declaration of Sun Yat-sen's Criminal Acts by the Revolutionaries in Southeast Asia",<ref name="yanq" /> which was printed and distributed in reformist newspapers like ''Nanyang Zonghui Bao''.<ref name="yanq" /><ref>Nanyang Zonghui bao. The Union Times paper. 11 November 1909 p2.</ref> The goal was to target Sun as a leader leading a revolt only for [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]].<ref name="yanq" />

The revolutionaries were polarized and split between pro-Sun and anti-Sun camps.<ref name="yanq" /> Sun publicly fought off comments about how he had something to gain financially from the revolution.<ref name="yanq" /> However, by 19 July 1910, the Tongmenghui headquarters had to relocate from Singapore to Penang to reduce the anti-Sun activities.<ref name="yanq" /> It was also in Penang that Sun and his supporters would launch the first Chinese "daily" newspaper, the ''[[Kwong Wah Yit Poh]]'', in December 1910.<ref name="Khoo" />

On 27 April 1911, the revolutionary [[Huang Xing]] led the [[Second Guangzhou Uprising|Yellow Flower Mound]] Uprising against the Qing. The revolt failed and ended in disaster. The bodies of only 72 revolutionaries were identified of the 86 that were found.<ref name="gtong195">王恆偉.

Despite the failure of this uprising, which was due to a leak, it was successful in triggering off the trend of nation-wide revolts.<ref>[https://youtube.com/shorts/rugEtlGtOCk?si=tDssz_14f3n8xW2k Bronze Relief of the 1911 Guangzhou (廣州) Uprising in Taipei Revolutionary Martyrs’ Shrine (YouTube)]</ref>

On 10 October 1911, the military [[Wuchang Uprising]] took place and was led again by Huang Xing. The uprising expanded to the [[Xinhai Revolution]], also known as the "Chinese Revolution", to overthrow the last emperor, [[Puyi]].<ref>Carol, Steven. (2009). ''Encyclopedia of Days: Start the Day with History''. iUniverse publishing.  {{ISBN|978-0595482368}}.</ref> Sun had no direct involvement in it, as he was in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], and had spent much of the year in the United States in search of support from [[Chinese Americans]]. That made Huang be in charge of the revolution that ended over 2000 years of imperial rule in China. On 12 October, when Sun learned of the successful rebellion against the Qing emperor from press reports, he returned to China from the United States and was accompanied by his closest foreign advisor, the American "General" [[Homer Lea]], an adventurer whom Sun had met in London when they attempted to arrange British financing for the future Chinese republic. Both sailed for China, arriving there on 21 December 1911.<ref>[[#Bergère|Bergère]]: 210</ref>

== Republic of China with multiple governments ==
=== Provisional government ===
{{Main|Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)}}
[[File:李鐵夫孫中山12345.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Sun Yat-sen'' (1921) by [[Li Tiefu]]]]
On 29 December 1911, a meeting of representatives from provinces in Nanjing elected Sun as the [[list of leaders of the Republic of China|provisional president]].<ref>Lane, Roger deWardt. (2008). ''Encyclopedia Small Silver Coins''.  {{ISBN|978-0615244792}}.</ref> 1 January 1912 was set as the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of the new [[Minguo calendar|republican calendar]].<ref name="Well">Welland, Sasah Su-ling. (2007). ''A Thousand Miles of Dreams: The Journeys of Two Chinese Sisters''. Rowman Littlefield Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0742553149}}. p. 87.</ref> [[Li Yuanhong]] was made provisional vice-president, and Huang Xing became the minister of the army. A new [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|provisional government]] for the Republic of China was created, along with a [[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China|provisional constitution]]. Sun is credited for funding the revolutions and for keeping revolutionary spirit alive, even after a series of false starts. His successful merger of smaller revolutionary groups into a single coherent party provided a better base for those who shared revolutionary ideals. Under Sun's provisional government, several innovations were introduced, such as the aforementioned calendar system, and fashionable [[Mao suit|Zhongshan suits]].

=== Beiyang government ===
{{Main|Beiyang government}}
[[Yuan Shikai]], who was in control of the [[Beiyang Army]], had been promised the position of president of the Republic of China if he could get the Qing court to abdicate.<ref name="Fu" /> On 12 February 1912, the Emperor did abdicate the throne.<ref name="Well" /> Sun stepped down as president, and Yuan became the new provisional president in Beijing on 10 March 1912.<ref name="Fu" /> The provisional government did not have any military forces of its own. Its control over elements of the new army that had mutinied was limited, and significant forces still had not declared against the Qing.

Sun Yat-sen sent telegrams to the leaders of all provinces to request them to elect and to establish the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China]] in 1912.<ref>[[#Bergère|Bergère]]: 226</ref> In May 1912, the legislative assembly moved from Nanjing to Beijing, with its 120 members divided between members of the Tongmenghui and a republican party that supported Yuan Shikai.<ref name="chien">Ch'ien Tuan-sheng.

Stanford University Press.  {{ISBN|978-0804705516}}. pp. 83–91.</ref> Many revolutionary members were already alarmed by Yuan's ambitions and the northern-based [[Beiyang government]].

=== New Nationalist party in 1912, failed Second Revolution and new exile ===
The Tongmenghui member [[Song Jiaoren]] quickly tried to control the assembly. He mobilized the old Tongmenghui at the core with the mergers of a number of new small parties to form a new political party, the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party, commonly abbreviated as "KMT") on 25 August 1912 at [[Huguang Guild Hall]], Beijing.<ref name="chien" /> The [[1912 Republic of China National Assembly elections|1912–1913 National assembly election]] was considered a huge success for the KMT, which won 269 of the 596 seats in the lower house and 123 of the 274 seats in the upper house.<ref name="Fu">Fu, Zhengyuan. (1993). ''Autocratic tradition and Chinese politics''(Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0521442282}}). pp. 153–154.</ref><ref name="chien" /> In retaliation, the KMT leader [[Song Jiaoren]] was assassinated, almost certainly by a secret order of Yuan, on 20 March 1913.<ref name="Fu" /> The [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] took place by Sun and KMT military forces trying to overthrow Yuan's forces of about 80,000 men in an armed conflict in July 1913.<ref>Ernest Young, "Politics in the Aftermath of Revolution", in John King Fairbank, ed., ''The Cambridge History of China: Republican China 1912–1949'', Part 1 (Cambridge University Press, 1983; {{ISBN|978-0521235419}}), p. 228.</ref> The revolt against Yuan was unsuccessful. In August 1913, Sun fled to Japan, where he later enlisted financial aid by the politician and industrialist [[Fusanosuke Kuhara]].<ref>Altman, Albert A., and Harold Z. Schiffrin.

=== Warlords chaos ===
In 1915, Yuan proclaimed the [[Empire of China (1915–1916)|Empire of China]] with himself as [[Emperor of China]]. Sun took part in the [[National Protection War]] of the [[Constitutional Protection Movement]] and also supported bandit leaders like [[Bai Lang Rebellion|Bai Lang]] during the [[Bai Lang Rebellion]], which marked the beginning of the [[Warlord Era]]. In 1915, Sun wrote to the [[Second International]], a [[socialist]]-based organization in [[Paris]], and asked it to send a team of specialists to help China set up the world's first socialist republic.<ref>''South China Morning post''.

China had become divided among regional military leaders. Sun saw the danger and returned to China in 1916 to advocate [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese reunification]]. In 1921, he started a self-proclaimed military government in [[Guangzhou]] and was elected [[Dayuanshuai|Grand Marshal]].<ref name="Bergere273">[[#Bergère|Bergère & Lloyd]]: 273</ref> Between 1912 and 1927, three governments were set up in South China: the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Provisional government in Nanjing (1912)]], the Military government in Guangzhou (1921–1925), and the National government in Guangzhou and later [[Wuhan]] (1925–1927).<ref>Kirby, William C.

The short-lived [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]] was a temporary replacement for the KMT. On 10 October 1919, Sun resurrected the KMT with the new name [[Names of China|Chung-kuo]] [[Kuomintang]], or "Nationalist Party of China."<ref name="chien" />

=== First United Front ===
{{Main|First United Front}}
[[File:Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek.jpg|thumb|left|Sun Yat-sen (seated) and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]]]
Sun was now convinced that the only hope for a unified China lay in a military conquest from his base in the south, followed by a period of {{ill|Outline of the Founding of the National Government|lt=political tutelage|zh|國民政府建國大綱}}, which would culminate in the transition to democracy. To hasten the conquest of China, he began a policy of active co-operation with the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP). Sun and the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Adolph Joffe]] signed the [[Sun-Joffe Manifesto]] in January 1923.<ref name="Tung1">Tung, William L. (1968). ''The political institutions of modern China''. Springer publishing. {{ISBN|978-9024705528}}. pp. 92, 106.</ref> Sun received help from the [[Comintern]] for his acceptance of communist members into his KMT.

With the Soviets' help, Sun was able to develop the military power needed for the [[Northern Expedition]] against the military at the north. He established the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] near Guangzhou with [[Chiang Kai-shek]] as the [[commandant]] of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA).<ref>Gao. James Zheng. (2009).

In February 1923, Sun made a presentation to the [[Students' Union]] in [[Hong Kong University]] and declared that the corruption of China and the [[peace, order, and good government]] of Hong Kong had turned him into a revolutionary.<ref>Ho, Virgil K.Y.

On 10 November 1924, Sun traveled north to [[Tianjin]] and delivered a speech to suggest a gathering for a "national conference" for the Chinese people.

=== Illness and death ===
For many years, it was popularly believed that Sun died of [[liver cancer]]. On 26 January 1925, Sun underwent an [[exploratory laparotomy]] at [[Peking Union Medical College Hospital]] (PUMCH) to investigate a long-term illness. It was performed by the head of the Department of Surgery, Adrian S. Taylor, who stated that the procedure "revealed extensive involvement of the liver by [[carcinoma]]" and that Sun had only about ten days to live. Sun was hospitalized, and his condition was treated with [[radium]].<ref name="barth:5">{{Cite journal|last1=Barth|first1=Rolf F. |last2=Chen |first2=Jie |date=1 January 2016 |title=What did Sun Yat-sen really die of?

In 1926, construction began on a majestic mausoleum at the foot of [[Purple Mountain (Nanjing)|Purple Mountain]] in Nanjing, which was completed in the spring of 1929. On 1 June 1929, Sun's remains were moved from Beijing and interred in the [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]].

By pure chance, in May 2016, an American pathologist, Rolf F. Barth, was visiting the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall (Guangzhou)|Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] in [[Guangzhou]] when he noticed a faded copy of the original autopsy report on display. The autopsy was performed immediately after Sun's death by James Cash, a pathologist at PUMCH. Based on a [[sampling (medicine)|tissue sample]], Cash concluded that the cause of death was an [[adenocarcinoma]] in the [[gallbladder]] that had [[metastasis|metastasized]] to the liver. In modern China, liver cancer is far more common than [[gallbladder cancer]]. Although the incidence rates for either one in 1925 are not known, if one assumes that they were similar at the time, the original diagnosis by Taylor was a reasonable conclusion. From the time of Sun's death to the appearance of Barth's report<ref name="barth:5" /> in the ''[[Chinese Journal of Cancer]]'' in September 2016, Sun's true cause of death was not reported in any English-language publication.

== Legacy ==
=== Power struggle ===
[[File:NRA Generals Northern Expedition.jpg|thumb|333px|Chinese generals at the [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]] in 1928 after the [[Northern Expedition]]. From right: [[He Chengjun|Cheng Jin]] ({{lang|zh|何成浚}}), [[Zhang Zuobao]] ({{lang|zh-hant|張作寶}}), [[Chen Diaoyuan]] ({{lang|zh-hant|陳調元}}), [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Woo Tsin-hang]], [[Yan Xishan]], [[Ma Fuxiang]], [[Ma Sida]] ({{lang|zh-hant|馬四達}}), and [[Bai Chongxi]].]]
After Sun's death, a power struggle between his young protégé [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his old revolutionary comrade [[Wang Jingwei]] split the KMT. At stake in the struggle was the right to lay claim to Sun's ambiguous legacy. In 1927, Chiang married [[Soong Mei-ling]], a sister of Sun's widow [[Soong Ching-ling]], and he could now claim to be a brother-in-law of Sun. When the [[12 April Incident|Communists and the Kuomintang split]] in 1927, which marked the start of the [[Chinese Civil War]], each group claimed to be his true heirs, and the conflict that continued until [[World War II]]. Sun's widow, [[Soong Ching-ling]], sided with the Communists during the Chinese Civil War and was critical of Chiang's regime since the [[Shanghai massacre]] in 1927. She served from 1949 to 1981 as vice-president (or vice-chairwoman) of the People's Republic of China and as honorary president shortly before her death in 1981.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.upmedia.mg/news_info.php?Type=5&SerialNo=127914 | title=她是中華民國國父的妻子 但是全力支持中國共產黨 -- 上報 / 生活 }}</ref>

=== Personality cult ===
A [[personality cult]] in the Republic of China was centered on Sun and his successor, [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. The cult was created after Sun Yat-sen died. Chinese Muslim generals and imams participated in the personality cult and the [[one-party state]], with Muslim General [[Ma Bufang]] making people bow to Sun's portrait and listen to the national anthem during a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Mongol people|Mongol]] religious ceremony for the [[Qinghai Lake]] god.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC&q=ma+bufang+lake+god+scarves|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity |author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|year=2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=51|isbn=0742511448|access-date=28 June 2010}}</ref> Quotes from the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Hadith]] were used by [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims to justify Chiang's rule over China.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C&q=jiang+hadith+jieshi+leader&pg=PA135|title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication |author1= Stéphane A.

The Kuomintang's constitution designated Sun as the party president. After his death, the Kuomintang opted to keep that language in its constitution to honor his memory forever. The party has since been headed by a director-general (1927–1975) and a chairman (since 1975), who discharge the functions of the president.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

Though he took a stance against [[idolatry]] in life, Sun sometimes became [[Apotheosis|worshiped as a god]] among people. For example, a KMT committee member Hsieh Kun-hong controversially referred to Sun as having "[[Xian (Taoism)|become immortal]]" after death under the posthumous name of "Great Merciful True Monarch" ({{zh|偉慈真君}}) in 2021. Sun is already worshipped in the syncretic Vietnamese religion of [[Caodaism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://international.thenewslens.com/article/150241|title=KMT Divided Over God-Status of Founder Sun Yat-sen|work=[[The News Lens]]|date=28 April 2021}}</ref>

=== Father of the Nation ===
[[File:Sun-jat-sen nanjing 140883.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sun's Mausoleum in Nanjing, with a [[Kuomintang]] flag on the ceiling]]
Sun Yat-sen remains unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for having a high reputation in both [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]]. In Taiwan, he is seen as the Father of the [[Republic of China]] and is known by the [[posthumous name]] ''[[Father of the Nation]], Mr. Sun Zhongshan'' ({{zh|t=國父 孫中山先生|links=no}}, and the [[Tai tou|one-character space]] is a traditional homage symbol).<ref name="sunbook2" />

=== Forerunner of revolution ===
[[File:五一天安门广场孙中山像.jpg|thumb|Sun Yat-sen tribute in [[Tiananmen Square]] in front of the [[Monument to the People's Heroes]], 2021]]
In Mainland China, Sun is seen as a Chinese nationalist, a proto-socialist, and the first president of a Republican China and is highly regarded as the Forerunner of the Revolution ({{lang|zh|革命先行者}}).<ref name="Tung1" /> He is even mentioned by name in the [[:wikisource:Constitution of the People's Republic of China|preamble]] to the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]]. In recent years, the leadership of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] has increasingly invoked Sun, partly as a way of bolstering [[Chinese nationalism]] in light of the [[Chinese economic reform]] and partly to increase connections with supporters of the Kuomintang on Taiwan, which the [[People's Republic of China]] sees as allies against [[Taiwan independence]]. [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|Sun's tomb]] was one of the first stops made by the leaders of both the Kuomintang and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] on their [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|pan-blue visit to mainland China in 2005]].<ref>Rosecrance, Richard N.

=== New Three Principles of the People ===
{{main|Three Principles of the People}}
Sun's Three Principles of the People has been reinterpreted by the Chinese Communist Party to argue that communism is a necessary conclusion of them and thus provide legitimacy for the government. This reinterpretation of the Three Principles of the People is commonly referred to as the New Three Principles of the People ({{Zh|c=新三民主義}}, also translated as "neo-tridemism"), a word coined by Mao's 1940 essay ''[[On New Democracy]]'' in which he argued that the Communist Party is a better enforcer of the Three Principles of the People compared to the bourgeois Kuomintang and that the new three principles are about allying with the communists and the Russians (Soviets) and supporting the peasants and the workers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mao |first=Zedong |title=On New Democracy |url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_26.htm |access-date=7 May 2022 |website=www.marxists.org}}</ref> Proponents of the New Three Principles of the People claim that Sun's book Three Principles of the People acknowledges that the principles of welfare is inherently socialistic and communistic.<ref>{{Cite wikisource|title=三民主义|wslanguage=zh|chapter=民生主义第一讲}}</ref>

During the 90th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution in 2001, former CCP General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] claimed that Sun supposedly advocated for the "New Three Principles of the People."<ref name="shanghaiist">{{cite web |author=Kenneth Tan |url=http://shanghaiist.com/2011/10/03/granddaughter_of_sun_yat-sen_accuse.php#photo-1 |title=Granddaughter of Sun Yat-Sen accuses China of distorting his legacy |publisher=Shanghaiist |date=3 October 2011 |access-date=8 October 2011 |archive-date=11 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011110026/http://shanghaiist.com/2011/10/03/granddaughter_of_sun_yat-sen_accuse.php#photo-1 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://china.dwnews.com/news/2011-10-01/58179861.html |script-title=zh:国父孙女轰中共扭曲三民主义愚民_多维新闻网 |language=zh |publisher=China.dwnews.com |date=1 October 2011 |access-date=8 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007154343/http://china.dwnews.com/news/2011-10-01/58179861.html |archive-date=7 October 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2001, Sun's granddaughter Lily Sun said that the Chinese Communists were distorting Sun's legacy. She again voiced her displeasure in 2002 in a private letter to Jiang about the distortion of history.<ref name="shanghaiist" /> In 2008 Jiang Zemin was willing to offer US$10&nbsp;million to sponsor a Xinhai Revolution anniversary celebration event. According to ''[[Ming Pao]]'', she did not take the money because then she would not "have the freedom to properly communicate the Revolution."<ref name="shanghaiist" />

=== KMT emblem removal case ===
In 1981, Lily Sun took a trip to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing. The emblem of the KMT had been removed from the top of his sacrificial hall at the time of her visit but was later restored. On another visit in May 2011, she was surprised to find the four-character "General Rules of Meetings" ({{lang|zh-hant|會議通則}}), a document that Sun wrote in reference to [[Robert's Rules of Order]] had been removed from a stone carving.<ref name="shanghaiist" />

===Founding father of the nation debate===
In 1940, the Republic of China (ROC) government had bestowed the title of "father of the nation" on Sun. However, after 1949, as a result of the Chiang regime's arrival in Taiwan, his "father of the nation" designation continued only in Taiwan.<ref name="foundingfatherdebate">{{cite web |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2016/02/29/2003640454 |title=Is Sun Yat-sen the 'founding father'? |work=Taipei Times |date=29 February 2016 |access-date=9 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229233559/https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2016/02/29/2003640454 |archive-date=29 December 2019}}</ref>

===Economic development===
Sun Yat-sen spent years in Hawaii as a student in the late 1870s and early 1880s and was highly impressed with the economic development that he saw there. He used the Kingdom of Hawaii as a model to develop his vision of a technologically modern, politically independent, actively [[anti-imperialist]] China.<ref>Lorenz Gonschor,  "Revisiting the Hawaiian Influence on the Political Thought of Sun Yat-sen." ''Journal of Pacific History'' 52.1 (2017): 52–67.</ref> Sun, an important pioneer of international development, proposed in the 1920s international institutions of the sort that appeared after World War II. He focused on China, with its vast potential and weak base of mostly local entrepreneurs.<ref>Eric Helleiner,  "Sun Yat-sen as a Pioneer of International Development." ''History of Political Economy'' 50.S1 (2018): 76–93.</ref>

His key proposal was socialism. He proposed:
:The State will take over all the large enterprises; we shall encourage and protect enterprises which may reasonably be entrusted to the people; the nation will possess equality with other nations; every Chinese will be equal to every other Chinese both politically and in his opportunities of economic advancement.<ref>Stephen Shen, and Robert Payne, ''Sun Yat-Sen: A Portrait'' (1946) p 182</ref>

He also proposed, "If we use existing foreign capital to build up a future communist society in China, half the work will bring double the results."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Unger |first1=Jonathan |title=Using the Past to Serve the Present: Historiography and Politics in Contemporary China |date=2015 |page=248 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Godley |first1=Michael R. |title=Socialism with Chinese Characteristics: Sun Yatsen and the International Development of China |journal=The Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs |year=1987 |volume=18 |issue=18 |pages=109–125 |doi=10.2307/2158585 |jstor=2158585 |s2cid=155947428 |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/2158585?journalCode=austjchinaffa}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Far East in the Modern World |date=1975 |publisher=Dryden Press |page=384}}</ref> He also said, "It is my idea to make capitalism create socialism in China."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Westad |first1=Odd Arne |title=Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750 |date=2012 |publisher=Random House |page=155}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=France-Malone |first1=Derek |title=Political Dissent: A Global Reader: Modern Sources |date=2011 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=175}}</ref>

Soong viewed Sun's actions as running directly against their shared religion.

Soong Ching-Ling's sister, [[Soong Mei-ling]], later married [[Chiang Kai-shek]].

=== Memorials and structures in Asia ===
[[File:Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall.jpg|thumb|Aerial perspective of Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, in central Singapore, taken in 2016]]
In most major [[Chinese cities]], one of the main streets is [[list of streets named after Sun Yat-sen|Zhongshan Lu]] ({{lang|zh-Hani|中山路}}) to celebrate Sun's memory. There are also numerous parks, schools, and geographical features named after him. Xiangshan, Sun's hometown in Guangdong, was renamed [[Zhongshan]] in his honor, and there is a hall dedicated to his memory at the [[Temple of Azure Clouds]] in Beijing. There are also a series of [[Sun Yat-sen stamps]].

Other references to Sun include the [[Sun Yat-sen University]] in Guangzhou and [[National Sun Yat-sen University]] in [[Kaohsiung]]. Other structures include [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]], [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall Station (Guangzhou)|Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall subway station]], [[Sun Yat-sen House (Nanjing)|Sun Yat-sen house]] in Nanjing, [[Dr Sun Yat-sen Museum]] in Hong Kong, [[Chung-Shan Building]], [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall (Guangzhou)|Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] in [[Guangzhou]], [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] in [[Taipei]] and [[Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall]] in Singapore. [[Zhongshan Memorial Middle School]] has also been a name used by many schools. [[Zhongshan Park]] is also a common name used for a number of places named after him. The first highway in Taiwan is called the [[National Highway No. 1 (Taiwan)|Sun Yat-sen expressway]]. Two ships are also named after him; the [[Chinese gunboat Chung Shan]] and the [[Chinese cruiser Yat Sen]]. The old Chinatown in [[Calcutta]] (now known as [[Kolkata]]), India, has the prominent Sun Yat-sen Street.
