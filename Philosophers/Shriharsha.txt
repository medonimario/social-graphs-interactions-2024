'''Shri-harsha''' ([[IAST]]: '''Śrīharṣa''') was a 12th century CE [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]] and [[Indian poetry|poet]]. Śrīharṣa works discuss various themes in [[Indian philosophy|Indian Philosophy]], such as [[pramana]]. He has been often interpreted as promoting [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedānta]] in his ''Sweets of Refutation'' (''Khaṇḍanakhaṇḍanakhādya''), however, this interpretation remains controversial among modern scholars.<ref name="Shradh Bhag 2">{{cite book |last1=Shashtri |first1=Pandurang |title=Shradh Bhag 2 |publisher=Nirmal Niketan |pages=29–42}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Citation |last=Das |first=Nilanjan |title=Śrīharṣa |date=2021 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2021/entries/sriharsa/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |access-date=2023-06-09 |edition=Winter 2021 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref><ref>Granoff, Phyllis E., 1978, ''Philosophy and Argument in Late Vedānta: Śrī Harṣa’s Khaṇḍanakhaṇḍakhādya'', Dodrecht: D.

== Life ==

Śrīharṣa was the son of Śrīhira and Mamalladevī. His father, Śrīhira, was a poet in the court of the [[Gahadavala]] king [[Vijayachandra]].{{sfn|M. Srinivasachariar|1974|p=177}} His father was also a guide of common people towards god with vedas, Bhagavad Gita's thoughts etc. His father asked Harsha at the time of his death to study well and become a pandit. He told him to use his shiksha (education) towards making life of common people divinity oriented and better. Also, he told Śrīharṣa to take thoughts of Bhagavad Gita to every one.

Śrīharṣa had a classic Indian education at a [[gurukula]], studying and living under guru's guidance. He mastered all scriptures and all schools of thoughts prevailing at that time. He famously wrote the ''Sweets of Refutation'' (''Khaṇḍanakhaṇḍanakhādya''), which critiques the epistemology of the [[Nyaya|Nyaya school]] and the rational inquiry in general.<ref name="Shradh Bhag 2"/>

Śrīharṣa spent his later life in ascetic serenity on the banks of River Ganga. He composed several works. These include ''Naiṣadhacarita,'' ''Khaṇḍanakhaṇḍakhādya,'' ''Vijayaprasasti'', ''Chindaprasasti'', ''Gaudorvisakulaprasasti'', ''Sahasankacarita'', ''Arnavavarnana'' and ''Amarakhandana''.

== Philosophy ==
Śrīharṣa's most well known philosophical text is the ''Khaṇḍanakhaṇḍakhādya'' ("Sugar-candy Pieces of Refutations" or just ''Sweets of Refutation'').<ref>{{cite book |author=C.Kunhan Raja |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/223739875/Survey-of-Sanskrit-Literature-C-Kunhan-Raja |title=Survey of Sanskrit Literature |publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |pages=147}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

Śrīharṣa thinks that any philosophical argument or view is subject to ''refutation-arguments'' (''khaṇḍana-yukti'') and thus all philosophical arguments are defeasible and are not sufficient evidence to believe in any philosophical view.<ref name=":0" />

The work focuses on [[Skepticism|skeptical]] critiques of rational philosophical proofs, especially the epistemological system of the [[Nyaya|Nyāya]]-[[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]] philosophical school.<ref name=":0" /> His main critique is the inadequacy of the Nyaya definitions of the six philosophical categories they defend: substance (''dravya''), quality (''[[guṇa]]''), action (''karma''), universal (''sāmānya''), ultimate differentiator (''viśeṣa''), and the relation of inherence (''samavāya'').<ref name=":0" /> Śrīharṣa also critiques the Nyaya definition of knowledge, and argues that there may no single satisfactory definition.<ref name=":0" />

Śrīharṣa thinks that his critiques also provide evidence for the [[Nonduality (spirituality)|non-duality]] of consciousness, the view that only consciousness truly exists.<ref name=":0" /> Indeed, while Śrīharṣa critiques almost all philosophical categories and views, including causality and the external world (apart from consciousness), he affirms the reality of consciousness.<ref name=":0" />

According to Śrīharṣa, all consciousness events are self-aware or self-revealing. Thus, consciousness knows itself, and this reflexive self-knowing is the only thing we need to know that consciousness is real. This view was commonly defended by the [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]] school of Buddhism, which defended the theory of self-reflexive awareness ([[Svasaṃvedana|svasamvedana]]).<ref name=":0" />

Śrīharṣa also seeks to show through his many critiques of rational Nyaya thought that using [[rationality]] to attempt to understand ultimate reality is a futile act. Thus, he thinks that rational argumentation cannot prove the dualistic system of Nyaya nor can it prove non-dualism either.<ref name=":0" /> Instead, he says that the method of knowing non-duality is a subtle awareness of non-duality which arises from contemplation based on hearing the words and great sentences ([[Mahāvākyas|mahavakyas]]) of the [[Upanishads|Upaniṣads]].<ref name=":0" />

One reading of the main idea of this text is that it seeks to show the instability of [[reason]], and how any rational argument can be undermined by further reasoning. Thus, reasoning is always inconclusive. Because of this, Śrīharṣa argues that Nyaya logicians should stop doing philosophy and have faith in the liberating power of the [[Upanishads|Upaniṣads]].<ref name=":0" /> Śrīharṣa is thus radically different from the Advaita philosopher [[Adi Shankara|Saṃkara]], who held that reason can help us better understand ultimate truth. For Śrīharṣa, reason is useless, only faith and the [[Upanishads|Upaniṣads]] will lead us to the truth of non-duality.<ref name=":0" />

== Poetry ==
Śrīharṣa composed the ''[[kāvya]]'' poem ''[[Naishadha Charita]]'' ([[IAST]]: ''Naiṣadhacarita'') in 1174, during the reign of the Vijayachandra's son [[Jayachandra]]. According to Rājaśekhara's ''[[Prabandha Kosha|Prabandhakośa]]'', upon the wide acceptance of ''Naishadha Charita'', Śrīharṣa was dignified with the title ''Narabharati''.{{sfn|M. Srinivasachariar|1974|p=177}}

The ''Naishadha Charita'' contains erotic themes, but according to the 15th-century Jain scholar [[Hammira Mahakavya|Nayachandra Suri]], Śrīharṣa was actually a celibate, who had "conquered his sense organs" (''jitendriya'').{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=37}}

The ''Naishadha Charita'' was brought into [[Gujarat]] by Harihara during the reign of [[Vaghela dynasty#Viradhavala|Vīradhavala]] to which Chandu Pandita in his ''Dipika'', composed in 1296, refers to as a new poem and also to the commentary of Vidyādhara. ''Naishadha Charita'' was composed earlier than ''Khaṇḍanakhaṇḍakhādya'' in which text Sriharsha alludes to the works of [[Kalidasa]].{{sfn|M. Srinivasachariar|1974|p=177}}
