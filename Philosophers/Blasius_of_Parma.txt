'''Blasius of Parma''' ('''Biagio Pelacani da Parma''') (c. 1350{{snd}}1416) was an Italian philosopher, mathematician and astrologer.<ref>Schmidt–Skinner, p. 809.</ref>
He popularised English and French philosophical work in Italy, where he associated both with scholastics and with early [[Renaissance humanist]]s.<ref name="Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy">{{cite book|title=Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseroutledge00edwa|url-access=registration|accessdate=3 August 2012|year=2000|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0-415-22364-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/conciseroutledge00edwa/page/91 91]}}</ref>

He was professor of mathematics at the [[University of Padua]], where he taught from 1382 to 1388; he taught also at the [[University of Pavia]] (1374? to 1378, and again 1389 to 1407), and the [[University of Bologna]] (1389 to 1382).<ref>{{cite book|author=David C.

His ''Tractatus de Ponderibus'' was based on Oxford theories on [[Classical mechanics|laws of motion]] taken up from the [[statics]] of [[Jordanus Nemorarius]], and introduced them into Italy.<ref>[[A. C. Crombie]], ''Medieval and Early Modern Science'' vol. II (1959), p. 101.</ref> He disagreed with the views of [[Thomas Bradwardine]] on [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], and gave a proof of the [[mean speed theorem]]. He also wrote on the natural philosophy of [[Aristotle]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Brian Lawn|title=Rise and Decline of the Scholastic Quaestio Disputata: With Special Emphasis on Its Use in the Teaching of Medicine and Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NF6EZFkfo9QC&pg=PA59|year=1993|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-09740-7|page=59}}</ref>
