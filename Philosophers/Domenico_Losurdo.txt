'''Domenico Losurdo''' (14 November 1941 – 28 June 2018) was an Italian [[historian]], [[essayist]], [[Marxist]] philosopher, and communist politician.

== Life and career ==
Born in [[Sannicandro di Bari]], Losurdo obtained his doctorate in 1963 from the [[University of Urbino]] under the guidance of Pasquale Salvucci with a thesis on [[Johann Karl Rodbertus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienzeformaz.urbino.com/Prodotti/SchedaProdotto.asp?PathID=329.402&IDDB=1&Lan=IT|title=Losurdo Domenico|publisher=University of Urbino|language=it|access-date=22 January 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717173427/http://www.scienzeformaz.urbino.com/Prodotti/SchedaProdotto.asp?PathID=329.402&IDDB=1&Lan=IT|archive-date=17 July 2011}}</ref> During the sixties, he was radicalized and belonged to a small group of Italian communists which sided with the [[People's Republic of China]] in the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. <ref>{{cite journal |url=https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii107/articles/david-broder-eastern-light-on-western-marxism |title=Eastern Light on Western Marxism |journal=[[New Left Review]] |date=October 2017 |issue=107 |pages=131–146 |last1=Broder |first1=David}}</ref> Losurdo was director of the Institute of Philosophical and Pedagogical Sciences at the University of Urbino, where he taught history of philosophy as [[Dean (education)|dean]] at the Faculty of Educational Sciences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uniurb.it/it/portale/index.php?mist_id=12000&lang=ENG&tipo=ENG&page=1070 |title=Faculties: Faculty of Education |publisher=[[University of Urbino]] |access-date=22 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722212506/http://www.uniurb.it/it/portale/index.php?mist_id=12000&lang=ENG&tipo=ENG&page=1070 |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> From 1988, Losurdo was president of the [[Hegelian]] International Association Hegel-Marx for Dialectical Thought.

Retrieved 18 May 2019.</ref>

Losurdo's philosophical-political reflection, attentive to the contextualization of philosophical thought in his own historical time, moved in particular from the themes of radical criticism of [[Criticism of liberalism|liberalism]], [[Criticism of capitalism|capitalism]], and [[Criticism of colonialism|colonialism]] as well as the traditional conception of totalitarianism in the perspective of a defence of [[Marxist dialectic]]s and [[historical materialism]], devoting himself to the study of [[anti-revisionism]] in the [[Marxist–Leninist]] sphere.<ref name="Liguori 2018"/><ref name=losurdo/> Losurdo included his works in the [[history of ideas]] and concerned the investigation of questions of contemporary history and politics, with constant critical attention to [[historical revisionism]] and the controversy against the interpretations of [[Hannah Arendt]], [[François Furet]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Ernst Nolte]]. In particular, Losurdo has criticized a [[reactionary]] tendency among contemporary revisionist historians such as Nolte (who traced the impetus behind the [[Holocaust]] to the excesses of the Russian Revolution) and Furet (who linked the [[Stalinist purges]] to a "disease" originating from the French Revolution). According to Losurdo, the intention of these revisionists is to eradicate the [[revolutionary]] tradition as their true motivations have little to do with the search for a greater understanding of the past but rather it lies in both the climate and ideological needs of the political classes and is most evident in the work of the English-speaking imperial revivalists, such as [[Niall Ferguson]] and [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]]. His 2015 book ''War and Revolution'', published by [[Verso Books]], provided a new perspective on the [[English Revolution|English]], [[American Revolution|American]], [[French Revolution|French]], [[Russian Revolution|Russian]], and [[Wars of national liberation|anti-colonial]] revolutions.<ref>Losurdo, Domenico (2015). ''War and Revolution: Rethinking the Twentieth Century''. Verso Books. {{ISBN|978-1781686164}}.</ref>

Losurdo turned his attention to the political history of modern [[German philosophy]] from Kant to [[Karl Marx]] and the debate that developed in Germany in the second half of the 19th and in the 20th century as well as a reinterpretation of the tradition of [[liberalism]], in particular starting from the criticism and accusations of hypocrisy addressed to [[John Locke]] for his financial participation in the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>Losurdo, Domenico (2003). ''Dalla teoria della dittatura del proletariato al gulag?'' (in Italian). In [[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]]; [[Friedrich Engels|Engels, Friedrich]]. ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Manifesto del partito comunista]]''. Translation and introduction by Losurdo. Bari: Editori Laterza. p. XL.</ref> Taking up what Arendt stated in her 1951 book ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Losurdo argued that the 20th century's true original sin was the [[New Imperialism]] in the form of colonial empire of the late 19th century, where [[totalitarianism]] and [[internment]] manifested for the first time.<ref name=counterhistory/> Diego Pautasso wrote that after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Losurdo "devoted himself to four areas of research: 1) critique of liberalism and the fight against the belief that liberals were at the forefront of democratic struggles; 2) balance of socialist experiences (USSR, China); 3) criticism of colonialism, imperialism and 'the various forms of subjugation of peoples to Washington and its allies'; 4) the critique of the contemporary left, in particular of 'Western Marxism', which would have 'neglected the great problems of its time', abandoned the 'class struggle and the struggle against imperialism' and embraced 'the narratives of globalization.'"<ref name="Sousa Gabriel 2020"/>

Upon Losurdo's death in 2018, Gianni Fresu wrote that "from the classics of philosophy to the debate around the figure of Stalin; from the analysis of the role of China to historical revisionism; from liberal thinking to the issues of Bonapartism and modern democracy; from the history of Western thought to the problems of colonialism and imperialism ... Losurdo's studies of historical materialism, as well as those of Kant, Hegel, Heidegger and Nietzsche, are a fundamental milestone in the history of ideas and events of human societies, such is their scientific seriousness and intellectual autonomy, their problematic richness and interpretative complexity."<ref>Fresu, Gianni (27 September 2018).

== Ideas and research ==
According to Losurdo, despecification is the exclusion of an [[individual]] or [[Ethnic group|group]] from the civilian [[community]]. There are two types of despecification:<ref name=indi/>
* Political and moral despecification in which the exclusion is due to [[political]] or [[moral]] factors.
* Naturalistic despecification in which the exclusion is due to [[biological factors]].

For Losurdo, naturalistic despecification is qualitatively worse than the political-moral. While the latter offers at least one escape through the change of [[ideology]], this is not possible in the case of naturalistic despecification since it is irreversible because it refers to biological factors that are in themselves unchangeable.<ref name=stalin/><ref>Brignoli, Maurizio (1 May 2005). [http://www.recensionifilosofiche.it/crono/2008-03/losurdo.htm "Losurdo, Domenico, Il linguaggio dell'impero. Lessico dell'ideologia"] (in Italian). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310235235/http://www.recensionifilosofiche.it/crono/2008-03/losurdo.htm|date=10 March 2016}}</ref> Unlike many other thinkers, Losurdo thought that [[the Holocaust]] of the [[Jewish people]] is not incomparable, though he was willing to admit its tragic specificity. Losurdo stated that the comparisons he offers about this did not seek to be a relativisation or a belittlement of the Holocaust, but that to consider the Jewish Holocaust as incomparable meant to lose historical perspective and to overlook the [[Black Holocaust]] (i.e. the [[genocide]] of [[black people]]) or the [[American Holocaust]] (i.e. the genocide of [[Native Americans in the United States]] through the continued deportation to the west with the [[Indian removal]] and diffusion of [[smallpox]]), as well as other mass exterminations such as the [[Armenian genocide]].<ref name=indi>{{cite book |last=Losurdo |first=Domenico |date=1999 |title=L'ebreo, il nero e l'indio nella storia dell'Occidente |trans-title=The Jew, the Black and the Indian in the history of the West |language=it |location=Urbino |publisher=Quattro venti}}</ref>

Losurdo was a strong critic of the equation of [[Nazism]] and [[communism]], made by scholars like [[François Furet]] and [[Ernst Nolte]]<ref name=stalin/><ref name=urss/> but also by [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Karl Popper]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Losurdo |first=Domenico |date=1998 |title=Popper falso profeta |trans-title=Popper False Prophet |language=it |publisher=Armando Editore |page=158}}</ref> Similarly, Losurdo criticized the concept of a [[Mass killings under communist regimes|Red Holocaust]].<ref name=stalin/> He argued that in the [[Nazi concentration camps]] there was an explicit homicidal intention because the [[Jew]] who entered one was destined not to get out of it (as there is a naturalistic despecification) while in the [[Gulag]] there was not (as it is political-moral despecification). In the first case, the Nazis imprisoned those whom they regarded as and called ''[[Untermensch]]'' (subhuman), while in the second case (in which, he claimed, only a part of the dissidents ended up) dissidents were locked up to be re-educated and not to be killed. Despite being a practice to be condemned, Losurdo stated that "the prisoner in the Gulag is a potential 'comrade' [the guard was required to call him this] ... and after 1937 [the beginning of the two-year long [[Great Purge]] following the murder of [[Sergey Kirov]]] he is ... a potential 'citizen.'"<ref name=stalin/><ref>Klinestiver, Matthew.

Taking up the opinion of [[Primo Levi]] (who was interned at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], according to whom the Gulag was not morally equivalent to the Nazi concentration camps), and against [[Soviet dissident]] [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] (who was interned in Siberia and asserted the equivalence of the exterminationist intent in both the Gulag and Nazi concentration camps), Losurdo maintained that, although it was a disgrace that a [[socialist country]], born as it is to abolish exploitation, resorted to [[imperialist]] and [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist]] systems and methods, the Gulag was more analogous to many Western [[concentration camps]] (whose governments have supported and claim to be champions of freedom) which in some ways were more akin to the Nazi concentration camps as [[death camp]]s and not re-educational, taking into consideration the history of the [[genocide of indigenous peoples]]. He also argued that [[British concentration camps]] and [[penal colonies]] were worse than any Gulag, accusing politicians such [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Harry S. Truman]] of being guilty of [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] just like – if not worse than – those attributed to [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=stalin/> Losurdo also took a critical view of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his [[nonviolent resistance]].<ref>Losurdo, Domenico (2010).

Autophobia was a concept developed by Losurdo to describe how sometimes victims tend to appropriate the point of view of their oppressors and begin to despise and hate themselves. The concept of autophobia was primarily developed within the framework of the study of [[Jewish history]] and the [[history of slavery]]. Losurdo extended this concept to [[social class]]es and [[political parties]] that have suffered defeat. Losurdo stated his belief that communists suffer from autophobia, defined as a fear of themselves and their own history, a pathological problem that must be faced, unlike healthy [[self-criticism]].<ref>Losurdo, Domenico (1999). ''Fuga dalla storia? Il movimento comunista tra autocritica e autofobia'' (in Italian). p. 6. "Autophobia is also manifested in the ranks of those who, while continuing to declare themselves communists, are obsessed with the desire to reaffirm that they have absolutely nothing to do with a past that they consider themselves to be their political opponents, as quite simply synonymous with abjection. The haughty narcissism of the victors, who transfigure their own history, corresponds to the self-flagellation of the vanquished. [...] Among the various problems which affect the communist movement, that of autophobia is certainly not the least. Let us leave aside the ex-leaders and ex-representatives of the Italian Communist Party (PCI), who sometimes claim to have joined this party in the distant past without ever having been communists."</ref><ref>Losurdo, Domenico (1999). ''Fuga dalla storia? Il movimento comunista tra autocritica e autofobia'' (in Italian). p. 7. "It goes without saying that the fight against the plague of autophobia will prove all the more effective as the balance sheet of the great and fascinating historical moment started by the October Revolution will be radically critical and without prejudice. Because, despite their assonances, self-criticism and autophobia are two antithetical attitudes. In its rigor, and even in its radicalism, self-criticism expresses the awareness of the need to settle its accounts until the end with its own history. Autophobia is a cowardly flight from this history and from the reality of the still burning ideological and cultural struggle. If self-criticism is the presupposition of the reconstruction of communist identity, autophobia is synonymous with surrender and renunciation of an autonomous identity."</ref>

In excerpts from a conference, organized in 2003, to re-evaluate the figure of Stalin fifty years after his death, Losurdo harshly criticized the revelations contained in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s "[[Secret Speech]]". According to Losurdo, Stalin's bad reputation derived not from the crimes committed by the latter – which he compared to others of that time – but from the falsehoods present in the report that Khrushchev read during the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in February 1956. Losurdo gave credit to one of the main accusations that were at the base of the [[Great Purge|bloody repression]] against his opponents, i.e. the existence of the "full-bodied reality of the [[fifth column]]" in the Soviet Union ready to ally with the enemy.<ref>Giacomini, Ruggero (2005). ''Stalin nella storia del Novecento'' (in Italian). Teti Editore. p. 139.</ref> Losurdo reiterated that he did not want to rehabilitate Stalin, but only to place him in the historical context and present a more neutral analysis of the facts, implementing a [[Historical revisionism|revisionism]] of the general experience of [[real socialism]],<ref name="urss">Losurdo, Domenico; Giacomini, Riggero, ed.

== Works ==
=== ''Aristocratic Rebel'' ===
In ''Aristocratic Rebel'' (2002), Losurdo criticized much of Nietzschean thought in the contemporary world, in particular, left-Nietzscheanism, whose influence on the left was a major problem because "it hollows out rationalist-oriented socialist thought and praxis and it often leads to an abandoning of universalism in favour of 'spiritual' interpretations of political struggle." This critique came from the application of Nietzsche by Italian leftists such as [[Giorgio Colli]] and [[Gianni Vattimo]], although left-Nietzscheanism is beyond just that setting.<ref name="Tutt 2018"/>

Tutt wrote, "[o]ne must read Losurdo's ''Aristocratic Rebel'' by staying true to his own method, that is, the political context of Losurdo's debates and polemics on the Italian left shape much of his critiques of Nietzschean thought in the contemporary world, especially left-Nietzscheanism." Tutt wrote "[w]hile Losurdo's comments on contemporary left-Nietzscheanism are brief, the convincing portrait of Nietzsche the book details generate ample material by which a new generation of Marxist philosophers and historians can begin to re-visit Nietzsche and the tradition of left-Nietzscheanism in particular."<ref name="Tutt 2018"/>

=== ''Historical Revisionism'' ===
In ''Historical Revisionism'' (1996), Losurdo criticised the [[historical revisionism]] of authors such as [[François Furet]] and [[Ernst Nolte]]. Similar to how [[Enzo Traverso]] spoke of a [[Second Thirty Years' War]] (1914–1945) following [[Arno J. Mayer]], Losurdo used the image of the Second Thirty Years War to use as "an expression that historians often use to denote the period of colossal upheavals between 1914 and 1945."<ref>Losurdo, Domenico (2007). ''Il revisionismo storico e i suoi miti. Nolte, Furet e gli altri''. Cologne: Papyrossa. p. 12. {{ISBN|978-3-89438-365-7}}.</ref> Losurdo accused Furet and Nolte for their theory that the [[Russian Revolution]] started the [[European Civil War]] in 1917 so that the conflict between [[Bolshevism]] and [[Nazism]] is emphasized and only the former is blamed. In doing so, these revisionist historians omitted two main moments that for Losurdo are indispensable in understanding the Second Thirty Years' War, namely the [[total war]] as an experience shared by all those involved in the war and [[colonialism]] as a common modern European phenomenon on the other.

Echoing Traverso, who wrote that "Eastern Europe certainly represented the 'living space' that one wanted to colonize, but this conquest implied the annihilation of the USSR and Bolshevism, a state and an ideology which the Nazis saw as the product of a connection between 'Jewish intelligentsia' and Slavic 'sub-humanity.' So this total war was at the same time a war of conquest, a war of race and a colonial war", Losurdo argued that the European Jews got into this colonialist scenario as "Oriental natives", stating: "The fact that the fate of the Jews has been sealed by their double stigmatization as oriental 'natives' and as carriers of oriental Bolshevism is not at all considered."<ref>Losurdo, Domenico (2007).

=== ''Liberalism: A Counter-History'' ===
{{main|Liberalism: A Counter-History}}
In ''[[Liberalism: A Counter-History]]'' (2005), first published in English in 2011, Losurdo argued that while purporting to emphasise the importance of individual liberty, liberalism has long been marked by its exclusion of people from these rights, resulting in [[racism]], [[slavery]], and [[genocide]]. Losurdo asserted that the origins of [[Nazism]] are to be found in what he views as [[colonialist]] and [[imperialist]] policies of the [[Western world]]. Losurdo examined the intellectual and political positions of intellectuals on [[modernity]]. In his view, [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] were the greatest thinkers of modernity, while [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was its greatest critic.<ref name=counterhistory>Losurdo, Domenico (2011).

=== ''Stalin: History and Critique of A Black Legend'' ===
In ''Stalin: History and Critique of A Black Legend'' (2008), Losurdo stimulated a debate about [[Joseph Stalin]], about whom he claimed is built a kind of [[black legend]] intended to discredit the whole of [[communism]].<ref name=stalin>{{cite book|title=Stalin: History and Criticism of A Black Legend|last=Losurdo|first=Domenico|publisher=Carocci|year=2008|isbn=978-8843077007|location=Rome}}</ref> Opposed to the [[comparison of Nazism and Stalinism]], Losurdo criticized the concept of [[totalitarianism]], especially in the works of [[Hannah Arendt]], [[François Furet]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Ernst Nolte]], among others. Losurdo argued that totalitarianism was a [[polysemic]] concept with origins in [[Christian theology]] and that applying it to the political sphere required an operation of abstract schematism which makes use of isolated elements of historical reality to place [[Nazi Germany]] and other [[fascist]] regimes, along with the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[socialist states]], in the dock together, serving the [[anti-communism]] of [[Cold War]]-era intellectuals rather than reflecting intellectual research.<ref name=totalitarianism>Losurdo, Domenico (2014). [https://archive.org/details/pdfy-dfBD-isycOcvHvqS "Towards a Critique of the Category of Totalitarianism"]. Retrieved 18 May 2019.</ref>

As a [[Hegelian]], Losurdo aimed to bring to historical knowledge two elements that are under-represented in Marxist historiography, namely [[rational]] reflection on the role of great men and rational criticism of the original form of moral leftism, or what Losurdo referred to as the "beautiful soul", which seeks to impose "the law of the heart" and the intelligence of its inevitable authoritarian reversal. For Losurdo, the ferment of [[authoritarianism]] in the [[communist movement]] is to be found more on the [[libertarian]] side of the communist utopia than in the [[reformist]] desire to build a state. Losurdo described his work on Stalin as a history of Stalin's image and not a biography or political history of the system with which his name is commonly associated. According to Losurdo, questioning the clichés of [[anti-Stalinism]] and [[Stalinism]], including in Communist ranks since 1956, required returning to the substance of the question of the evaluation of Soviet history from 1922 to 1953 and even beyond, since the categories of anti-Stalinism and Stalinism have been generalized to the study of other [[socialist state]]s ruled by [[communist parties]] and other personalities, such as [[Mao Zedong]] in China and [[Fidel Castro]] in Cuba.<ref name=stalin/> For Losurdo, the study of "the black legend" was partly mixed with a rehabilitation of the personality and the figure of Stalin the statesman, who is clearly distinguished from the political regime. The starting point was the observation that at the time of his death in March 1953, the image of Stalin was rather positive in the world, propaganda on both sides aside. It was the dissemination of the [[Khrushchev report]] that "cast the god into hell." According to Losurdo, it was a document originating in the internal struggle in the leadership of the party, therefore lacking in credibility.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Introduzione|title=Stalin: History and Criticism of A Black Legend|last=Losurdo|first=Domenico|publisher=Carocci|year=2008|isbn=978-8843077007|location=Rome}}</ref>

Writing for ''[[il manifesto]]'', Guido Liguori stated that "[h]is controversial ''Stalin. Storia e critica di una leggenda nera'' was not without its interesting elements. He proposed not so much to ''save'' Stalin (in fact he recognized many of his limits and faults)", but "he also refused to consider Stalin in merely negative terms."<ref name="Liguori 2018"/> Writing for ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'', historian David Broder argued that "[w]hile he recognized the exorbitant, paranoid aspects of Stalin's leadership, his efforts to relativize it were often governed by a polemical zeal unjustified by the evidence marshaled. This made his reframing of Stalinism more 'interesting' than necessarily persuasive."<ref name="Broder 2018"/> Historian Sean Purdy accused Losurdo of [[charlatanism]], puting his book on the same level as the works of [[Grover Furr]] and [[Ludo Martens]], while contrasting it with what called more serious authors, like [[Robert W. Thurston]] and [[J. Arch Getty]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=aterraehredonda |date=2021-02-06 |title=Como não fazer história |url=https://aterraeredonda.com.br/como-nao-fazer-historia/ |access-date=2024-01-08 |website=A Terra é Redonda |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

The book rendered Losurdo's polarising view. ''[[O Globo]]'' summarized that Losurdo has been "[p]raised for his criticism of liberalism by some, and accused of Stalinism by others. ... From liberals to the far left, everyone has an adjective on the tip of their tongue (or fingers) to refer to Caetano's new favourite author: Stalinist, revolutionary, farcical, anti-imperialist, revisionist. For some, the Italian was a champion of socialism who denied the farces propagated by liberalism. For others, he was a defender of the crimes of the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin (1878-1953) and of Chinese authoritarianism." ''O Globo'' wrote that Losurdo compared the crimes of Stalin with those of liberalism (genocides sponsored by capitalist nations, concentration camps maintained by the colonial powers, and war crimes) and argued that in the end, it is the liberals who have the dirtiest or worst track record.<ref name="Sousa Gabriel 2020">Sousa Gabriel, Ruan (18 September 2020).

A review written in April 2009 by Guido Liguori in ''[[Liberazione (newspaper)|Liberazione]]'' (the official organ of the [[Communist Refoundation Party]]) of his book, in which Losurdo criticized the demonisation of Stalin carried out by the predominant historiography and tried to remove it from what he calls "the black legend about him", was at the center of a controversy within the drafting of the aforementioned review. A storm of protests ensued when around twenty editors sent a letter of protest to the editor of the newspaper in which they criticized both Losurdo's attempt at Stalin's rehabilitation in his book and Liguori's review (judged to be too positive with respect to the book) as well as with the choice of the editor of the newspaper to publish said review.<ref>Liguori, Guido (10 April 2009).

The publication in the communist newspaper ''[[Liberazione (newspaper)|Liberazione]]'' of a positive review by Guido Liguori on Losurdo's book about Stalin caused a crisis in the paper's editorial staff: twenty journalists wrote a letter to the editor Dino Greco, criticizing what they perceived as Losurdo's attempts at Stalin's rehabilitation, alongside Liguori's review (which they perceived as too positive) and Greco's decision to publish it.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Lettere su Stalin |work=[[Liberazione (newspaper)|Liberazione]] |url=http://letteresustalin.liberazione.it/ |access-date=2019-05-18 |archive-date=2010-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116001009/http://letteresustalin.liberazione.it/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Losurdo's work was also derided by Italian liberal journalist [[Andrea Romano (politician)|Andrea Romano]], who accused Losurdo and [[Luciano Canfora]] of "trying to create a harmless Stalinism".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Romano |first=Andrea |date=11 November 2008 |title=Losurdo, Canfora e lo stalinismo che non fa male |work=[[La Stampa]] |url=http://andrearomano.ilcannocchiale.it/2008/11/11/losurdo_canfora_e_lo_stalinism.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803212317/http://andrearomano.ilcannocchiale.it/2008/11/11/losurdo_canfora_e_lo_stalinism.html |archive-date=2020-08-03 }}</ref>

About Losurdo's work on Stalin, Cicero wrote that "[u]nlike the typical old-time Stalinist, Losurdo does not evade a series of crimes committed by the regime and its dictator, nor does it qualify them simply as 'mistakes'. Also unlike the classic Stalinist, the author is not concerned with showing the coherence of his practices with Marxism or Leninism." Cicero further stated "it is the ability and perspicacity to face realistically the great problems of your country and its time – even against the most ingrained beliefs and utopias of your former travel companions – that the book seeks to highlight. In spite of all the barbarities committed, Stalin and his regime leave their multifaceted assessment with a positive balance." Cicero argued that this was not because "they knew how to build possible socialism, the famous 'socialism in one country", but "for the simple reason that they managed to build a state and a society sufficiently vertebrate to face the chaos of the Russian 'second period of disorder' and the European 'second war of the thirties', with its most deadly by-product (Nazism), were it not for that tremendous endeavour, albeit a bloody one, it was destined to destroy the Slavic nations to the east." Cicero wrote that "Stalin and Stalinism are, in short, defended for reasons to which any admirer of State-building as a good in itself, regardless of its ideological purposes and justifications, should surrender. 'Socialism in one country' becomes, in this sense, just a formula that the dictator and his supporters improvised to fit this elementary task to the language that was understandable to them."<ref name="Cicero 2012"/>

Bernardo Vargaftiq of ''Esquerda Online'' praised Losurdo for ''[[Liberalism: A Counter-History]]'' and his work on capitalism, colonialism, and liberalism, stating that "books like 'The Counterhistory of Liberalism' are positive, exposing liberalism ... in an energetic and very well documented way" and "[t]he examples given by Losurdo of the extreme reactionary nature of so-called liberals, including people often cited laudably, such as Toqueville, are edifying."<ref>Vargaftiq, Bernardo (13 September 2020).

"He wrote important books on the history of European and American liberalism, showing that his mentors theorized the most rigorous anti-egalitarianism, elections under the regime of legal or practical exclusion of indigenous peoples and blacks and the poor. With slavery, worker exploitation and large-scale commercial shipping, liberal colonial policy allowed the initial development of capitalism. This is another disparaging aspect of so-called liberalism, studied to Losurdo's satisfaction. It is not useless to remember that several tens of millions of inhabitants of present-day Mexico, Brazil and Peru were eliminated by the combined action of the massacres of the conquerors and the infections they transmitted; the same happened with the trafficking of Africans reduced to slavery."</ref> While stating that "reading these books on Liberalism and Bonapartism is useful to historians and Marxists in general, they illustrate the history of capitalism in very convincing detail", Vargaftiq referred to Losurdo as a "neo-Stalinist chic", and criticized him for making a nationalist rather than Marxist analysis, for supporting the fifth column theory, and in general for his dismissive views of [[Trotskyism]].<ref>Vargaftiq, Bernardo (13 September 2020).

"It is an elegant defense of a 'chic' neo-Stalinism, but a total abandonment of Marxism, which, while not deterministic as it incorporates superstructural influences, clearly indicates that it is the class analysis that allows us to understand social evolution (in this case, the regression). On the other hand, it is interesting to note that Losurdo's Marxism ceases when he examines the figure of Stalin and the political and social developments of the 1990s."</ref>

About Losurdo's work on [[Western Marxism]], Marxist historian Mario Maestri wrote that this is "a false split and a false controversy", and accused Losurdo of replacing "the proletarian internationalism and class struggles of the 'Western Marxists' with the unified nation – that is, bourgeoisie and united proletarians – in the name of national developmentalism – as if development, as well as science and technology, were ideologically neutral and not dictated by the interests of the dominant versus the dominated classes."<ref name="Cotrim & Velloso 2020"/> Maestri, who defends the thesis "we live in a historical counterrevolutionary phase", whose "milestones were the capitalist restoration in China in 1978 under the leadership of reformer Deng Xiaoping and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1992 – events that consolidated the globalization of capitalism", accused Losurdo of presenting "an apology for the capitalism of the Chinese Communist Party and its many business projects in Asia, Africa and Latin America", establishing this "as the only alternative for its economic development and the only way for the emancipation of European and American imperialism." According to Maestri, Losurdo defended that "the working classes of the countries on the periphery of the capital – Asia, Africa and Latin America – give up their political independence and pragmatically ally themselves with the capitalism of the Chinese CP."<ref name="Cotrim & Velloso 2020"/>
