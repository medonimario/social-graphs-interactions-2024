'''Gregory Vlastos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|l|æ|s|t|oʊ|s}}; {{langx|el|Γρηγόριος Βλαστός}}; July 27, 1907 &ndash; October 12, 1991) was a preeminent scholar of [[ancient philosophy]], and author of many works on Plato and Socrates. He transformed the analysis of classical philosophy by applying techniques of modern [[analytic philosophy]] to restate and evaluate the views of Socrates and Plato.<ref name=obitNYT>{{cite news|author=Lambert, Bruce|date=October 14, 1991|title=Gregory Vlastos, 84, Philosopher Who Analyzed Classical Works|newspaper=NY Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/14/nyregion/gregory-vlastos-84-philosopher-who-analyzed-classical-works.html}}</ref>

==Life and works==
Vlastos was born in [[Istanbul]], to a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] mother and a [[Greek people|Greek]] father, where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Robert College]] before moving to [[Harvard University]] where he received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1931. After teaching for several years at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], Canada, he moved to [[Cornell University]] in 1948. He was Stuart Professor of Philosophy at [[Princeton University]] between 1955 and 1976, and then Mills Professor of Philosophy at [[University of California, Berkeley]] until 1987. He received a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Foundation Fellowship]] in 1990.<ref name=obitNYT/> He was twice awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Gregory Vlastos|website=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/gregory-vlastos/}}</ref> was a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], a corresponding fellow of the [[British Academy]], and a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref name="proceedings">[http://www.aps-pub.com/proceedings/1482/480211.pdf An ''In memoriam'' essay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011217/http://www.aps-pub.com/proceedings/1482/480211.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> In 1988 he gave the British Academy's Master-Mind Lecture.<ref>{{cite web|title=Master-Mind Lectures|website=The British Academy|url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/events/lectures/listings/master-mind-lectures/}} [https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/documents/2368/74p089.pdf text]</ref> Vlastos died in 1991, before finishing a new compilation of essays on Socratic philosophy.

He is credited with bringing about a renaissance of interest in [[Plato]] among philosophers throughout the world.<ref name="proceedings"/> Many of Vlastos' students have become important scholars of ancient philosophy, including [[Terence Irwin]], [[Richard Kraut]], [[Paul Woodruff]], and [[Alexander Nehamas]].

==Theory of Socratic philosophy==
In his work ''The Philosophy of Socrates: a Collection of Critical Essays'' (UNDP 1971), Vlastos advanced the idea "that one can identify in certain Platonic dialogues a philosophical method and a collection of philosophical theses which may properly be attributed to [[Socrates]]."<ref name=Talisse>{{cite journal|title=Misunderstanding Socrates|author=Robert B. Talisse|journal=Arion|edition=9.3|year=2002|pages=111–121}}</ref> He suggested a plausible modern analytic framework for Socratic philosophy as a pursuit distinct from Platonic philosophy. The dialogues of Plato’s Socratic period, called "[[elenctic]] dialogues" for Socrates’s preferred method of questioning, are [[Apology (Plato)|''Apology'']], [[Charmides (dialogue)|''Charmides'']], [[Crito (dialogue)|''Crito'']], ''[[Euthyphro]]'', [[Gorgias (dialogue)|''Gorgias'']], ''[[Hippias Minor]]'', [[Ion (dialogue)|''Ion'']], [[Laches (dialogue)|''Laches'']], [[Protagoras (dialogue)|''Protagoras'']] and book 1 of the [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']].<ref name=Nails>{{Cite SEP|url-id=socrates|title=Socrates|first=Debra|last=Nails|date=2018}}</ref>  The idea remains controversial<ref name="Met987b">Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', 1.987b[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D987b]</ref><ref>[[John_M._Cooper_(philosopher)|Cooper, John M.]]; Hutchinson, D.S., eds.
