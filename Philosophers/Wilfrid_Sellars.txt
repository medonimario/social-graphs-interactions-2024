'''Wilfrid Stalker Sellars''' (May 20, 1912 – July 2, 1989) was an American philosopher and prominent developer of [[Critical realism (philosophy of perception)|critical realism]],<ref>Willem deVries, 2014. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars Wilfrid Sellars]," ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Aug. 11,</ref> who "revolutionized both the content and the method of philosophy in the United States".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/15/opinion/l-a-philosopher-who-shattered-our-complacency-598389.html|title=A Philosopher Who Shattered Our Complacency|date=15 August 1989|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

==Life and career==
His father was the Canadian-American philosopher [[Roy Wood Sellars]], a leading American philosophical naturalist in the first half of the twentieth-century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/sella-rw/|title=Sellars, Roy Wood - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu}}</ref> Wilfrid was educated at the [[University of Michigan]] (BA, 1933), the [[University at Buffalo]], and [[Oriel College, Oxford]] (1934–1937), where he was a [[Rhodes Scholar]], obtaining his highest earned degree, an MA, in 1940. During World War II, he served in military intelligence. He then taught at the [[University of Iowa]] (1938–1946), the [[University of Minnesota]] (1947–1958), [[Yale University]] (1958–1963), and from 1963 until his death, at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/6UiV-vMOueY Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131006144540/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UiV-vMOueY&gl=US&hl=en Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UiV-vMOueY|title=Introduction to Wilfrid Sellars lecture, Naturalism and Ontology|website=[[YouTube]]|date=16 September 2012 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> He served as president of the [[Metaphysical Society of America]] in 1977. He was a founder of the journal ''[[Philosophical Studies]]''.

Sellars is well known as a critic of [[foundationalism|foundationalist]] [[epistemology]]—the "[[#"Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind"|Myth of the Given]]" as he called it.<ref name=SEP>{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/sellars/|title=Wilfrid Sellars – The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Willem|last=deVries|chapter=Wilfrid Sellars |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=30 June 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> However, his philosophical works are more generally directed toward the ultimate goal of reconciling intuitive ways of describing the world (both those of common sense and traditional philosophy) with a thoroughly naturalist, scientific account of reality. He is widely regarded both for great sophistication of argument and for his assimilation of many and diverse subjects in pursuit of a [[synoptic vision]]. Sellars was perhaps the first philosopher to synthesize elements of American [[pragmatism]] with elements of British and American [[analytic philosophy]] and Austrian and German [[logical positivism]]. His work also reflects a sustained engagement with the German tradition of [[transcendental idealism]], most obviously in his book ''Science and Metaphysics: Kantian Variations''.

==Philosophical work==
Sellars coined certain now-common idioms in philosophy, such as the "space of reasons". This idiom refers to two things. It:
# Describes the conceptual and behavioral web of language that humans use to get intelligently around their world,
# Denotes the fact that talk of reasons, epistemic justification, and intention is not the same as, and cannot necessarily be mapped onto, talk of causes and effects in the sense that physical science speaks of them.
Note: (2) corresponds in part to the distinction Sellars makes between the manifest image and the scientific image.

==="Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind"<!--'Myth of the Given' redirects here-->===
{{see also|Perceptual conceptualism}}
Sellars's most famous work is "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind" (1956).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ditext.com/sellars/epm.html|title=EMPIRICISM AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF MIND|website=ditext.com}}</ref> In it, he criticizes the view that knowledge of what we perceive can be independent of the conceptual processes which result in perception. He named this "'''The Myth of the Given'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->," attributing it to [[sense-data]] theories of knowledge.

The work targets several theories at once, especially [[C. I. Lewis]]' Kantian pragmatism and [[Rudolf Carnap]]'s positivism. He draws out "The Myth of Jones," to defend the possibility of a strict [[behaviorist]] world-view. The parable explains how thoughts, intelligent action, and even subjective inner experience can be attributed to people within a scientific model. Sellars used a fictional tribe, the "Ryleans," since he wanted to address [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s ''[[The Concept of Mind]]''.

Sellars's idea of "myth", heavily influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Endres |first=Tobias |date=2021 |title=Ernst Cassirer's Influence on the Philosophy of Wilfrid Sellars |url=https://www.torrossa.com/de/resources/an/5141687 |journal=Cassirer Studies |volume=13/14 |pages=149–170 |via=Torrossa}}</ref> is not necessarily negative. He saw it as something that can be useful or otherwise, rather than true or false. He aimed to unite the conceptual behavior of the "space of reasons" with the concept of a subjective [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]. This was one of his most central goals, which his later work described as [[Kantian]].

==="The Language of Theories"<!--'Kantian empiricism' redirects here-->===
In his paper "The Language of Theories“ (1961), Sellars introduces the concept of '''Kantian empiricism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->. [[Kantian]] [[empiricism]] features a distinction between (1) claims whose revision requires abandonment or modification of the system of [[concept]]s in terms of which they are [[Conceptual framework|framed]] (i.e., modification of the [[fallible]] set of [[Conceptual framework|constitutive principles]] underlying knowledge, otherwise known as [[Conceptual framework|framework-relative]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truths) and (2) claims revisable on the basis of observations formulated in terms of a system of concepts which remained fixed throughout.<ref name=SEP2009/>

==="Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man"===
In his "Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man" (1962), Sellars distinguishes between the "manifest image" and the "scientific image" of the world.

The manifest image includes intentions, thoughts, and appearances. Sellars allows that the manifest image may be refined through 'correlational induction', but he rules out appeal to imperceptible entities.

The scientific image describes the world in terms of the theoretical physical sciences. It includes notions such as causality and theories about particles and forces.

The two images sometimes complement one another, and sometimes conflict. For example, the manifest image includes practical or moral claims, whereas the scientific image does not. There is conflict, e.g. where science tells us that apparently solid objects are mostly empty space. Sellars favors a synoptic vision, wherein the scientific image takes ultimate precedence in cases of conflict, at least with respect to empirical descriptions and explanations.<ref>Brassier, Ray, Nihil Unbound (2007) p.3</ref>

==="Meaning as Functional Classification"===
In "Meaning as Functional Classification" (1974) Sellars elaborated upon a version of [[functional role semantics]] that he had previously defended in prior publications.<ref>Sellars, W. (1974). Meaning as Functional Classification: A perspective on the relation of syntax to semantics. Synthese, 27(3-4), 417-437.</ref> <ref>Sellars, W. (1954). Some reflections on language games. Philosophy of Science, 21(3), 204-228.</ref> <ref>Sellars, W. (1950). Language, Rules and Behavior.</ref> For Sellars, thoughts are analogous to linguistic utterances, and both thoughts and linguistic utterances gain their content through token thoughts or utterances standing in certain relations with other thoughts, stimuli, and responses. <ref>Piccinini, G. (2004). Functionalism, computationalism, and mental contents. Canadian Journal of Philosophy, 34(3), 375-410.</ref>

==Politics==
The son of a socialist,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=863 |edition=Second}}</ref> Sellars was involved in left-wing politics. As a student at the [[University of Michigan]], Wilfrid Sellars was one of the founding members of the first North-American [[student housing cooperative|cooperative house for university students]], which was then called "[[Michigan Cooperative House|Michigan Socialist House]]" (and which was later renamed "[[Michigan Cooperative House]]").<ref>{{cite journal | title=Remembering the Mich House founders | last=Jones | first=Jim <!-- authorlink=Jim Jones (cooperatives) --> | journal=The Alumni Cooperator| publisher=[[Inter-Cooperative Council]] | location=[[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] | year=2007–2008| url=http://www.icc.coop/remember/archives/pubs/ac2007.pdf | page=15 }}</ref> He also campaigned for the socialist candidate [[Norman Thomas]] of the [[Socialist Party of America]].<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/|title = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter = Wilfrid Sellars|year = 2021|publisher = Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref>

==Legacy<!--'Pittsburgh School' and 'Analytic Hegelianism' redirect here-->==
[[Robert Brandom]], his junior colleague at Pittsburgh, named Sellars and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] as the two most profound and important philosophers of their generation. Sellars's goal of a [[synoptic philosophy]] that unites the everyday and scientific views of reality is the foundation and archetype of what is sometimes called the '''Pittsburgh School'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, whose members include Brandom, [[John McDowell]], and [[John Haugeland]].<ref>Chauncey Maher, ''The Pittsburgh School of Philosophy''. Routledge. 2012.</ref> Especially Brandom introduced a [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] variety of the Pittsburgh School, often called '''analytic Hegelianism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->.<ref>[[Robert Brandom]], ''A Spirit of Trust: A Reading of Hegel's Phenomenology'', Harvard University Press, 2019.</ref><ref>deVries, Willem A. "Hegel's Revival in Analytic Philosophy". In: ''The Oxford Handbook of Hegel''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017. pp. 743–766: "Analytic philosophy is rediscovering Hegel. [There is] a particularly strong thread of new analytic Hegelianism, sometimes called 'Pittsburgh Hegelianism' ... The sociality and historicity of reason, the proper treatment of space and time, conceptual holism, inferentialism, the reality of conceptual structure, the structure of experience, and the nature of normativity are the central concerns of Pittsburgh Hegelianism."</ref>

Other philosophers strongly influenced by Sellars span the full spectrum of contemporary English-speaking philosophy, from [[neopragmatism]] ([[Richard Rorty]]) to [[eliminative materialism]] ([[Paul Churchland]]) to [[rationalism]] ([[Laurence BonJour]]). Sellars's philosophical heirs also include [[Ruth Millikan]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Héctor-Neri Castañeda]], [[Bruce Aune]], [[Jay Rosenberg]], [[Johanna Seibt]], [[Matthew Burstein]], [[Ray Brassier]], [[Andrew Chrucky]], [[Jeffrey Sicha]], Pedro Amaral, [[Thomas Vinci]], [[Willem A. de Vries]], [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David Rosenthal]], [[Ken Wilber]] and [[Michael Williams (philosopher)|Michael Williams]]. Sellars's work has been drawn upon in feminist [[standpoint theory]], for example in the work of [[Quill Kukla]].<ref>Rebecca Kukla, "Objectivity and Perspective in Empirical Knowledge". Episteme 3(1): 80–95. 2006.</ref>

Sellars's death in 1989 was the result of long-term alcohol use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ditext.com/sellars/felder.html|title=Susanna Felder|website=www.ditext.com}}</ref> A collection of essays devoted to 'Sellars and his Legacy' was published by Oxford University Press in 2016 (James O'Shea, ed., ''Wilfrid Sellars and his Legacy''), with contributions from Brandom, deVries, Kraut, Kukla, Lance, McDowell, Millikan, O'Shea, Rosenthal, Seibt, and Williams.
