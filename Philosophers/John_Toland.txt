'''John Toland''' (30 November 1670{{snd}}11 March 1722) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[rationalist]] philosopher and [[freethought|freethinker]], and occasional [[satirist]], who wrote numerous books and pamphlets on [[political philosophy]] and [[philosophy of religion]], which are early expressions of the philosophy of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Born in Ireland, he was educated at the universities of [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Leiden|Leiden]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and was influenced by the philosophy of [[John Locke]].

His first, and best known work, ''[[Christianity Not Mysterious]]'' (1696), opposed hierarchy in both church and state. In Ireland, copies were burned by the public hangman, and he was forced to flee the country never to return. 

==Biography==
Very little is known of Toland's early life. He was born in [[Ardagh, County Donegal|Ardagh]] on the [[Inishowen|Inishowen Peninsula]], a predominantly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Irish language|Irish]]-speaking region in northwestern Ireland. His parents are unknown. He would later write that he had been baptised ''Janus Junius'', a play on his name that recalled both the Roman two-faced god [[Janus]] and [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Junius Brutus]], reputed founder of the [[Roman Republic]]. According to his biographer [[Pierre des Maizeaux]], he adopted the name John as a schoolboy with the encouragement of his school teacher.<ref>Biography of John Toland by his contemporary Pierre des Maizeaux, dated 26 May 1722, which is readable online and downloadable at {{OL|806650W}}.</ref>

Having formally converted from Catholicism to Protestantism at the age of 16, Toland got a scholarship to study theology at the [[University of Glasgow]]. In 1690, at age 19, the [[University of Edinburgh]] conferred a master's degree on him. He then got a scholarship to spend two years studying at [[University of Leiden]] in Holland, and subsequently nearly two years at Oxford in England (1694–95), where he acquired a reputation for great learning and "little religion."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=1048}} The Leiden scholarship had been provided by wealthy [[English Dissenters]], who hoped Toland would go on to become a minister for Dissenters.

In Toland's first book ''[[Christianity not Mysterious]]'' (1696), begun at Oxford,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=1048}} he argued that the divine revelation of the Bible contains no true mysteries; rather, all the dogmas of the faith can be understood and demonstrated by properly trained reason from natural principles. His argument immediately attracted several rebuttals, and he was prosecuted by a grand jury in London.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=1048}} As he was a subject of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], members of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] proposed that he should be burnt at the stake, and in his absence—curtailing a visit in 1697, he fled the country<ref>{{Cite web |last=Newman |first=Kate |date=1993 |title=The Dictionary of Ulster Biography |url=http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/viewPerson/1641 |access-date=2023-04-02 |website=www.newulsterbiography.co.uk}}</ref>—16 three copies of the book were burnt by the public hangman in [[Dublin]] as the content was contrary to the core doctrines of the [[Church of Ireland]]. Toland bitterly compared the Protestant legislators to "Popish [[Inquisition|Inquisitors]] who performed that Execution on the Book, when they could not seize the Author, whom they had destined to the Flames".<ref>Gilbert JT, ''History of the City of Dublin'' (1854) vol 3 p66.</ref>

After his departure from Oxford Toland resided in London for most of the rest of his life, but was also a somewhat frequent visitor to the European continent, particularly Germany and the Netherlands. He lived on the Continent from 1707 to 1710. Toland died in Putney on 10 March 1722.<ref>{{cite journal |title='Manuscripts of Mine Abroad': John Toland and the Circulation of Ideas, c.&nbsp;1700-1722 |author=J. A. I.

Nor could frowns or fortune bend him to decline from the ways he had chosen." Although he himself had written biographies in his career, it concludes, tellingly: "If you would know more of him, search his writings."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1xKG9ZehhQC&pg=PA13 |title=''John Toland, his Methods, Manners and Mind'' by Stephen Daniel|isbn=9780773510074|last1=Daniel|first1=Stephen H|date=October 1984|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP }}</ref>

Very shortly after his death a lengthy biography of Toland was written by [[Pierre des Maizeaux]].<ref>This primary and authoritative source on the life of Toland is downloadable as a 92-page preface to the book ''A Collection of Several Pieces of John Toland'' {{OL|806650W}}.</ref>

==Political thought==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
John Toland was the first person called a [[Freethought|freethinker]] (by Bishop [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]) and went on to write over a hundred books in various domains but mostly dedicated to criticising ecclesiastical institutions. A great deal of his intellectual activity was dedicated to writing political tracts in support of the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] cause. Many scholars know him for his role as either the biographer or editor of notable republicans from the mid-17th century such as [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Algernon Sidney]] and [[John Milton]]. His works ''Anglia Libera'' and ''State Anatomy'' are prosaic expressions of an English republicanism which reconciles itself with constitutional monarchy. During a brief visit to [[Hanover]] in 1701, he was received by the [[Sophia of Hanover|electress Sophia]], as ''Anglia Libera'' contained a defence of the [[Hanoverian succession]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=1049}}
[[File:Rare Medium PR 3581 .T574 000009.tif|thumb|left|The first page of "The Life of John Milton", authored by Toland in 1699. Digitized by the University of Notre Dame Hesburgh Libraries.]]

After ''Christianity Not Mysterious'', Toland's views became gradually more radical. His opposition to hierarchy in the church also led to opposition to hierarchy in the state; bishops and kings, in other words, were as bad as each other, and monarchy had no God-given sanction as a form of government. In his 1704 ''Letters to Serena''—in which he used the expression "[[pantheism]]"—he carefully analysed the manner by which truth is arrived at, and why people are prone to forms of "false consciousness."

In politics his most radical proposition was that [[liberty]] was a defining characteristic of what it means to be human. Political institutions should be designed to guarantee freedom, not simply to establish order.  For Toland, reason and tolerance were the twin pillars of the good society. This was [[Whiggism]] at its most intellectually refined, the very antithesis of the [[Toryism|Tory]] belief in sacred authority in both [[Church of England|church]] and [[Kingdom of England|state]].  Toland's belief in the need for perfect equality among free-born citizens was extended to the [[Jews|Jewish]] community, tolerated, but still outsiders in early 18th century England. In his 1714 work ''Reasons for Naturalising the Jews'', he called for naturalizing foreign-born Jews and allowing them to hold public office.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Historical Atlas of the Jewish People |publisher=Hutchinson |year=1992 |isbn=0 09 177593 0 |editor-last=Barnavi |editor-first=Eli |pages=138–139 |chapter=The Return to Western Europe}}</ref> The work borrowed from [[Simone Luzzatto]] 1638 ''Discourse on the Jews of Venice''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Barzilay |first=Isaac E. |date=1969 |title=John Toland's Borrowings from Simone Luzzatto: Luzzatto's Discourse on the Jews of Venice (1638) the Major Source of Toland's Writing on the Naturalization of the Jews in Great Britain and Ireland (1714) |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4466483 |journal=Jewish Social Studies |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=75–81 |issn=0021-6704}}</ref>

Toland's world was not all detached intellectual speculation, though. There was also an incendiary element to his political pamphleteering, and he was not beyond whipping up some of the baser [[Anticatholicism|anti-Catholic]] sentiments of the day in his attacks on the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]].

===Literary hoax "The Treatise of the Three Imposters"===
He also produced some highly controversial polemics, rumors including the ''[[Treatise of the Three Impostors]]'', in which Christianity, [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] are all condemned as the three great political frauds. The ''Treatise of the Three Imposters'' was rumoured to exist in manuscript form since the Middle Ages and excoriated throughout all of Europe. It is now thought that the work did not exist.

Toland claimed to have a personal copy of the manuscript which he passed to the circle of [[Jean Rousset]] in France. Rumours that it was then translated into French were taken seriously by some: however, not by [[Voltaire]], who issued a satirical reply.<ref>''Making Man in Reason's Image : The Enlightenment and the Birth of Modern Humanity'' (Portable Professor Series) by James Schmidt.</ref>

===Editions of republican radicals of the 1650s===
His [[Republicanism|republican]] sympathies were also evidenced by his editing of the writings of some of the great radicals of the 1650s, including [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Algernon Sydney]], [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[John Milton]].  In his support for the Hanoverian monarchy he somewhat moderated his republican sentiments; though his ideal kingship was one that would work towards achieving civic virtue and social harmony, a 'just liberty' and the 'preservation and improvement of our reason.'  But [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and the oligarchy behind Walpole were about as far from Toland's ideal as it is possible to get.

==Contributions to natural philosophy==
Toland influenced [[Baron d'Holbach]]'s ideas about physical motion. In his ''Letters to Serena'', Toland claimed that rest, or absence of motion, is not merely relative. Actually, for Toland, rest is a special case of motion. When there is a conflict of forces, the body that is apparently at rest is influenced by as much activity and passivity as it would be if it were moving.

==Religious thought==
{{More citations needed section|date=January 2008}}
The resemblance, both in title and in principles, of ''Christianity not Mysterious'' to Locke's 1695 ''Reasonableness of Christianity'', led to a prompt disavowal on Locke's part of the supposed identity of opinions, and subsequently to the [[Edward Stillingfleet#Philosophical controversy|controversy]] between [[Edward Stillingfleet]] and Locke. Toland's next work of importance, the ''Life of Milton'' (1698) referred to "the numerous supposititious pieces under the name of Christ and His apostles and other great persons," provoked the charge that he had called in question the genuineness of the [[New Testament]] writings. Toland replied in his ''Amyntor, or a Defence of Milton's Life'' (1699), to which he added a remarkable list of what are now called [[New Testament apocrypha]]. In his remarks he really opened up the great question of the history of the [[Biblical canon]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=1048–1049}}

Toland identified himself as a [[pantheist]] in his publication ''Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist'' in 1705. At the time when he wrote ''Christianity not Mysterious'' he was careful to distinguish himself from both sceptical atheists and orthodox theologians. After having formulated a stricter version of [[John Locke|Locke]]'s [[epistemological]] rationalism, Toland then goes on to show that there are no facts or doctrines from the Bible which are not perfectly plain, intelligible and reasonable, being neither contrary to reason nor incomprehensible to it.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=1049}} All revelation is human revelation; that which is not rendered understandable is to be rejected as gibberish.

However, David Berman has argued for an atheistic reading of Toland, demonstrating contradictions between ''Christianity not Mysterious'' and Toland's ''Two Essays'' (London, 1695). Berman's reading of Toland and Charles Blount attempts to show that Toland deliberately obscured his real atheism so as to avoid prosecution whilst attempting to subliminally influence unknowing readers, specifically by creating contradictions in his work which can only be resolved by reducing Toland's God to a pantheistic one, and realising that such a non-providential God is, for Blount, Toland and Colins, "...no God, or as good as no God...In short, the God of theism is ''blictri'' for Toland; only the determined material God of pantheism exists, and he (or it) is really no God."<ref>David Berman,"Disclaimers in Blount and Toland", in: Hunter & Wootton (eds.), ''Atheism from the Reformation to the Enlightenment'', (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992) pp. 268–272</ref>

After his ''Christianity not Mysterious'', Toland's "Letters to Serena" constitute his major contribution to philosophy. In the first three letters, he develops a historical account of the rise of superstition arguing that human reason cannot ever fully liberate itself from prejudices.  In the last two letters, he founds a metaphysical [[materialism]] grounded in a critique of monist substantialism.  Later on, we find Toland continuing his critique of church government in ''Nazarenus'' which was first more fully developed in his "Primitive Constitution of the Christian Church", a clandestine writing in circulation by 1705. The first book of "Nazarenus" calls attention to the right of the [[Ebionites]] to a place in the early church. The thrust of his argument was to push to the very limits the applicability of canonical scripture to establish institutionalised religion. Later works of special importance include Tetradymus wherein can be found Clidophorus, a historical study of the distinction between esoteric and exoteric philosophies.

His ''Pantheisticon, sive formula celebrandae sodalitatis socraticae'' (Pantheisticon, or the Form of Celebrating the Socratic Society), of which he printed a few copies for private circulation only, gave great offence as a sort of liturgic service made up of passages from pagan authors, in imitation of the [[Church of England]] liturgy. The title also was in those days alarming, and still more so the mystery which the author threw around the question how far such societies of pantheists actually existed. The term "[[pantheism]]" was used by Toland to describe the philosophy of [[Spinoza]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=1049}}

Toland was famous for distinguishing exoteric philosophy—what one says publicly about religion—from esoteric philosophy—what one confides to trusted friends. In 2007 Fouke's ''Philosophy and Theology in a Burlesque Mode: John Toland and the Way of Paradox'' presented an analysis of Toland's 'exoteric strategy' of speaking as others speak, but with a different meaning. He argues that Toland's philosophy and theology had little to do with positive expression of beliefs, and that his philosophical aim was not to develop an epistemology, a true metaphysical system, an ideal form of governance, or the basis of ethical obligation, but to find ways to participate in the discourses of others while undermining those discourses from within. Fouke traces Toland's practices to Shaftesbury's conception of a comic or 'derisory' mode of philosophising aimed at exposing pedantry, imposture, dogmatism, and folly.

==Influence and legacy==
Toland was a man not of his time; one who advocated principles of virtue in duty, principles that had little place in the England of [[Robert Walpole]], governed by cynicism and self-interest.  His intellectual reputation, moreover, was subsequently eclipsed by the likes of [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]], and still more by [[Montesquieu]] and the French radical thinkers. [[Edmund Burke]] in his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' wrote dismissively of Toland and his fellows: "Who, born within the last 40 years, has read one word of [[Anthony Collins (philosopher)|Collins]], and Toland, and [[Matthew Tindal|Tindal]], and [[Thomas Chubb|Chubb]], and [[Thomas Morgan (deist)|Morgan]], and that whole race who called themselves Freethinkers?"

Still, in ''Christianity not Mysterious'', the book for which he is best known, Toland laid down a challenge not just to the authority of the established church, but to all inherited and unquestioned authority.  It was thus as radical politically and philosophically, as it was theologically.

Of his influence, humanities professor Robert Pattison wrote: "Two centuries earlier the establishment would have burned him as a heretic; two centuries later it would have made him a professor of comparative religion in a California university. In the rational Protestant climate of early 18th-century Britain, he was merely ignored to death."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pattison |first1=Robert |title=The Triumph of Vulgarity |url=https://archive.org/details/triumphvulgarity00patt_032 |url-access=limited |year=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-503876-2 |oclc=13699782 |page=[https://archive.org/details/triumphvulgarity00patt_032/page/n36 22]}}</ref>

However, Toland managed to find success after his death: [[Thomas Hollis (1720–1774)|Thomas Hollis]], the great 18th century book collector and editor, commissioned the London bookseller [[Andrew Millar]] to publish works advocating republican government - a list of titles which included Toland's work in 1760.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/4.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from Andrew Millar to Thomas Cadell, 16 July, 1765.
