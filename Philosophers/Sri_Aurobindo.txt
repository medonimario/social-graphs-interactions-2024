'''Sri Aurobindo''' (born '''Aurobindo Ghose'''; 15 August 1872&nbsp;– 5 December 1950) was an Indian [[philosopher]], [[Modern yoga gurus|yogi]], [[maharishi]], [[poet]], Educationalist 
and [[Indian nationalist]].<ref name="Chaama 2021">{{cite news |last=Chaama |first=Sridhar |title=Remembering a guru |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/remembering-a-guru/article3779469.ece |access-date=17 August 2021 |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=16 August 2012 |archive-date=16 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816191250/https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/remembering-a-guru/article3779469.ece |url-status=live }}</ref> He was also a [[journalist]], editing newspapers such as [[Bande Mataram (publication)|''Bande Mataram'']].{{sfnp|McDermott|1994|pp=11–12, 14|ps=}} He joined the [[Indian independence movement|Indian movement for independence]] from [[British Raj|British colonial rule]], until 1910 was one of its influential leaders, and then became a spiritual reformer, introducing his visions on human progress and [[spiritual evolution]].There is a movie created about him called a new dawn. It is hand drawn and has over 23000 pictures

Aurobindo studied for the [[Imperial Civil Service|Indian Civil Service]] at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], in Cambridge, England. After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the Maharaja of the [[princely state]] of [[Baroda State|Baroda]] and became increasingly involved in nationalist politics in the [[Indian National Congress]] and the nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal with the [[Anushilan Samiti]]. He was arrested in the aftermath of a number of bombings linked to his organization in a public trial where he faced charges of treason for [[Emperor v. Aurobindo Ghosh and others|Alipore Conspiracy]]. However, Sri Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against British colonial rule in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution witness, Narendranath Goswami, during the trial. During his stay in the jail, he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], leaving politics for spiritual work.

At Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo developed a spiritual practice he called [[Integral Yoga]]. The central theme of his vision was the evolution of human life into a divine life in a divine body. He believed in a spiritual realisation that not only liberated but transformed human nature, enabling a divine life on earth. In 1926, with the help of his spiritual collaborator, [[Mirra Alfassa]] (referred to as "The Mother"), [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] was founded.

Sri Aurobindo was nominated twice for the Nobel prize without it being awarded, in 1943 for the Nobel award in Literature and in 1950 for the Nobel award in Peace.

His main literary works are ''The Life Divine'', which deals with the philosophical aspect of Integral Yoga;<ref>{{cite book|title = The Life Divine|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wxhrPwAACAAJ|isbn = 9788170588443|access-date = 19 June 2021|last1 = Sri Aurobindo|first1 = Sri|date = May 2009|publisher = Sri Aurobindo Ashram Publication Department|archive-date = 5 February 2024|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240205053256/https://books.google.com/books?id=wxhrPwAACAAJ|url-status = live}}</ref> ''Synthesis of Yoga'', which deals with the principles and methods of Integral Yoga;<ref>{{cite book|title = The Synthesis of Yoga|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC|isbn = 9780941524667|access-date = 19 June 2021|last1 = Sri Aurobindo|first1 = Sri|year = 1992|publisher = Lotus Press|archive-date = 5 February 2024|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240205053231/https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC|url-status = live}}</ref> and ''[[Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol]]'', an [[epic poem]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Aurobindo Ghose was born in [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata), [[Bengal Presidency]], [[India]] on 15 August 1872 in a [[Bengali Kayastha]] family that was associated with the town of [[Konnagar]] in the [[Hooghly district]] of present-day [[West Bengal]].<ref name = "Bandyopadhyay6">Bandyopadhyay, Amritalal, ''Rishi Aurobindo'', 1964, Biswas Publishing House, p. 6.</ref> His father, Krishna Dhun Ghose, was then assistant surgeon of [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]] in Bengal and later civil surgeon of [[Khulna]], and a former member of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] religious reform movement who had become enamoured with the then-new idea of [[evolution]] while pursuing medical studies in [[Edinburgh]].<ref>{{cite conference |last=Aall |first=Ingrid |year=1971 |editor1=Robert Paul Beech |editor2=Mary Jane Beech |book-title=Bengal: change and continuity, Issues 16–20 |publisher=Asian Studies Center, Michigan State University |location=East Lansing |page=32 |oclc=258335 |quote=Aurobindo's father, Dr. Krishnadhan Ghose, came from a Kayastha family associated with the village of Konnagar in Hooghly District near Calcutta, Dr. Ghose had his medical training in Edinburgh...}}</ref>{{efn|Aurobindo described his father as a "tremendous atheist" but Thakur calls him an agnostic and Heehs believes that he followed his own coda.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=3–7, 10|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=3|ps=}}}} His mother Swarnalata Devi's father [[Rajnarayan Bose|Shri Rajnarayan Bose]] was a leading figure in the Samaj. She had been sent to the more salubrious surroundings of Calcutta for Aurobindo's birth. Aurobindo had two elder siblings, Benoybhusan and [[Manmohan Ghose|Manmohan]], a younger sister, Sarojini, and a younger brother, [[Barindra Kumar Ghose|Barindra Kumar]] (also referred to as Barin).{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=3–7, 10|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=3|ps=}}

Young Aurobindo was brought up speaking English, but used [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] to communicate with servants. Although his family were [[Bengali people|Bengali]], his father believed [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]] to be superior. He and his two elder siblings were sent to the English-speaking [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling|Loreto House]] boarding school in [[Darjeeling]], in part to improve their language skills and in part to distance them from their mother, who had developed a mental illness soon after the birth of her first child. Darjeeling was a centre of [[Anglo-Indians]] in India and the school was run by Irish nuns, through which the boys would have been exposed to Christian religious teachings and symbolism.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=8–9|ps=}}

=== England (1879–1893) ===
[[File:Aurobindo.family.jpg|125px|thumb|upright|left|Aurobindo (seated centre next to his mother) and his family. In England, ca. 1879{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=10|ps=}}]]
Krishna Dhun Ghose wanted his sons to enter the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]] (ICS), an elite organisation comprising around 1000 people. To achieve this it was necessary that they study in England and so it was there that the entire family moved in 1879.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=9–10|ps=}}{{efn|Krishna Dhun Ghose returned to India soon after, leaving his wife in the care of a physician in London. Barindra was born in England in January 1880.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=10|ps=}}}} The three brothers were placed in the care of the Reverend W. H. Drewett in [[Manchester]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=9–10|ps=}} Drewett was a minister of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]] whom Krishna Dhun Ghose knew through his British friends at Rangpur.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=10, 13|ps=}}{{efn|While in Manchester, the Ghose brothers lived first at 84 Shakespeare Street and then, by the time of the 1881 census, at 29 York Place, [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]]. Aurobindo was recorded in the census as Aravinda Ghose, as he was also by the University of Cambridge.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=14|ps=}}{{sfn|1881 Census|ps=}}{{sfn|ACAD|GHS890AA}}}}

The boys were taught [[Latin (language)|Latin]] by Drewett and his wife. This was a prerequisite for admission to good English schools and, after two years, in 1881, the elder two siblings were enrolled at [[Manchester Grammar School]]. Aurobindo was considered too young for enrollment, and he continued his studies with the Drewetts, learning history, Latin, [[French language|French]], geography and arithmetic. Although the Drewetts were told not to teach religion, the boys inevitably were exposed to Christian teachings and events, which generally bored Aurobindo and sometimes repulsed him. There was little contact with his father, who wrote only a few letters to his sons while they were in England, but what communication there was indicated that he was becoming less endeared to the British in India than he had been, on one occasion describing the British colonial government as "heartless".{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=14|ps=}}

[[File:Basement of 49 St Stephen's Avenue with Sri Aurobindo Blue Plaque.JPG|thumb|250px|upright| Basement of 49 St Stephen's Avenue, London W12 with Sri Aurobindo [[Blue Plaque]]]]
Drewett emigrated to Australia in 1884, causing the boys to be uprooted as they went to live with Drewett's mother in London. In September of that year, Aurobindo and Manmohan joined [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] there.{{efn|Benoybhusan's education ended in Manchester.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=19|ps=}}}} He learned Greek and spent the last three years reading literature and English poetry, while he also acquired some familiarity with the German and Italian languages; [[Peter Heehs]] resumes his linguistic abilities by stating that at "the turn of the century he knew at least twelve languages: English, French, and Bengali to speak, read, and write; Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit to read and write; Gujarati, Marathi, and Hindi to speak and read; and Italian, German, and Spanish to read."<ref>Peter Heehs, ''The Lives of Sri Aurobindo'', Columbia University Press (2008), p. 43</ref> Being exposed to the evangelical structures of Drewett's mother developed in him a distaste for religion, and he considered himself at one point to be an [[Atheism|atheist]] but later determined that he was [[Agnosticism|agnostic]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=14–18|ps=}} A [[blue plaque]] unveiled in 2007 commemorates Aurobindo's residence at 49 St Stephen's Avenue in [[Shepherd's Bush]], London, from 1884 to 1887.{{sfn|English Heritage|ps=}} The three brothers began living in spartan circumstances at the Liberal Club in [[South Kensington]] during 1887, their father having experienced some financial difficulties. The club's secretary was James Cotton, brother of their father's friend in the Bengal ICS, [[Henry John Stedman Cotton|Henry Cotton]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=18|ps=}}

By 1889, Manmohan had determined to pursue a literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfill his father's aspirations but to do so when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=19|ps=}} To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of [[Oscar Browning]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|pp=29–30|ps=}} He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College.{{sfn|ACAD|GHS890AA}} Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=31|ps=}}In 1891 Sri Aurobindo also felt that a period of great upheaval for his motherland was coming in which he was destined to play an important role. He began to learn Bengali and joined a secret society, romantically named 'Lotus and Dagger', where the members took an oath to work for India's freedom.<ref>https://aurosociety.org/society/index/1872-–-1893-Calcutta-to-England#:~:text=Sri%20Aurobindo%20also%20felt%20that,to%20work%20for%20India%27s%20freedom.</ref>

At this time, the Maharaja of Baroda, [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]], was travelling in England. Cotton secured for him a place in Baroda State Service and arranged for him to meet the prince.{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=6|ps=}} He left England for India,{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=6|ps=}} arriving there in February 1893.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=34|ps=}} In India, Krishna Dhun Ghose, who was waiting to receive his son, was misinformed by his agents from [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai) that the ship on which Aurobindo had been travelling had sunk off the coast of Portugal. His father died upon hearing this news.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=36|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=7|ps=}}

=== Baroda and Calcutta (1893–1910) ===
{{Main|Political history of Sri Aurobindo}}
{{See also|Anushilan Samiti}}
In [[Vadodara|Baroda]], Aurobindo joined the state service in 1893, working first in the Survey and Settlements department, later moving to the Department of Revenue and then to the Secretariat, and much miscellaneous work like teaching grammar and assisting in writing speeches for the Maharaja of [[Gaekwad]] until 1897.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=37|ps=}} In 1897 during his work in Baroda, he started working as a part-time French teacher at [[Baroda College]] (now Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda). He was later promoted to the post of vice-principal.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=42|ps=}} At Baroda, Aurobindo self-studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Bengali (language)|Bengali]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=43|ps=}}
[[File:Bande mataram.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Copy of ''Bande Mataram'', September 1907]]
During his stay at Baroda, he had contributed to many articles to ''Indu Prakash'' and had spoken as a chairman of the Baroda college board.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=68|ps=}} He started taking an active interest in the politics of the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule, working behind the scenes as his position in the Baroda state administration barred him from an overt political activity. He linked up with resistance groups in Bengal and [[Madhya Pradesh]], while travelling to these states. Aurobindo established contact with [[Lokmanya Tilak]] and [[Sister Nivedita]].

Aurobindo often travelled between Baroda and Bengal, at first in a bid to re-establish links with his parents' families and other Bengali relatives, including his sister Sarojini and brother Barin, and later increased to establish resistance groups across the Presidency. He formally moved to Calcutta in 1906 after the announcement of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]]. In 1901, on a visit to Calcutta, he married 14-year-old Mrinalini, the daughter of Bhupal Chandra Bose, a senior official in government service. Aurobindo was 28 at that time. Mrinalini died seventeen years later in December 1918 during the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza pandemic]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=53|ps=}}

In 1906, Aurobindo was appointed the first principal of the National College in Calcutta, started to impart national education to Indian youth.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ghose |first1=Aurobindo |title=The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo. |publisher=Sri Aurobindo Ashram Publication Dept |location=Pondicherry |isbn=978-81-7058-496-4 |page=Vol 36: Autobiographical Notes, pg 54}}</ref> He resigned from this position in August 1907, due to his increased political activity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Advice to National College Students |url=https://www.aurobindo.ru/workings/sa/37_06_07/0256_e.htm |website=Site of Sri Aurobindo & The Mother |access-date=19 June 2021 |archive-date=28 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210728020806/https://www.aurobindo.ru/workings/sa/37_06_07/0256_e.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The National College continues to the present as Jadavpur University, Kolkata.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/about_us.php |website=Jadavpur University Website |access-date=19 June 2021 |archive-date=13 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211113221806/http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/about_us.php |url-status=live }}</ref>

Aurobindo was influenced by studies on rebellion and revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy. In his public activities, he favored Non cooperation and [[Nonviolent resistance|Passive resistance]]; in private he took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation for open revolt, in case that the passive revolt failed.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=71|ps=}}

[[File:Sri Aurobindo presiding over a meeting of the Nationalists after the Surat Congress, with Tilak speaking, 1907.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Sri Aurobindo seated at the table, with [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]] speaking: Surat session of Congress, 1907]]
In Bengal, with Barin's help, he established contacts and inspired revolutionaries such as [[Bagha Jatin]] or Jatin Mukherjee and [[Surendranath Tagore|Surendranath]] Tagore. He helped establish a series of youth clubs, including the [[Anushilan Samiti]] of Calcutta in 1902.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=67|ps=}}

Aurobindo attended the 1906 [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] meeting headed by [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] and participated as a councilor in forming the fourfold objectives of "Swaraj, Swadesh, Boycott, and national education". In 1907 at the [[Surat Split|Surat session]] of Congress where moderates and extremists had a major showdown, he led along with extremists along with [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]]. The Congress split after this session.{{sfnp|Thorpe|2010|p=29|ps=C}} In 1907–1908 Aurobindo travelled extensively to [[Pune]], Bombay and Baroda to firm up support for the nationalist cause, giving speeches and meeting with groups. He was arrested again in May 1908 in connection with the [[Alipore Bomb Case]]. He was acquitted in the ensuing trial, following the murder of chief prosecution witness Naren Goswami within jail premises, which subsequently led to the case against him collapsing. Aurobindo was subsequently released after a year of isolated incarceration.

Once out of the prison he started two new publications, ''Karmayogin'' in English and ''Dharma'' in Bengali. He also delivered the, [[s:Uttarpara Speech|Uttarpara Speech]] hinting at the transformation of his focus to spiritual matters. Repression from the British colonial government against him continued because of his writings in his new journals and in April 1910 Aurobindo moved to Pondicherry, where the British colonial [[secret police]] monitored his activities.{{sfnp|Lorenzo|1999|p=70|ps=}}{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=217|ps=}}

=== Conversion from politics to spirituality ===
[[File:Aurobindo jail picture.JPG|thumb|237x237px|left| Photographs of Aurobindo
as a prisoner in [[Alipore Jail]], 1908.]]
In July 1905 then [[Viceroy of India]], [[Lord Curzon]], [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partitioned Bengal]]. This sparked an outburst of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries that included Aurobindo. In 1908, [[Khudiram Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chaki]] attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, the wife and daughter of barrister [[Pringle Kennedy]]. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in [[Alipore Jail]]. The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually, he was acquitted on 6 May 1909. His defense counsel was [[Chittaranjan Das]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=86|ps=}}

During this period in the Jail, his view of life was radically changed due to spiritual experiences and realizations. Consequently, his aim went far beyond the service and liberation of the country. {{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=61|ps=}}

Aurobindo said he was "visited" by [[Vivekananda]] in the Alipore Jail: "It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the jail in my solitary meditation and felt his presence."{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=98|ps=}}

In his autobiographical notes, Aurobindo said he felt a vast sense of calmness when he first came back to India. He could not explain this and continued to have various such experiences from time to time. He knew nothing of yoga at that time and started his practice of it without a teacher, except for some rules that he learned from Mr. Devadhar, a friend who was a disciple of Swami Brahmananda of Ganga Math, Chandod.<ref>K.R.S. Iyengar, ''Sri Aurobindo – a biography and a history'', Pondicherry, 1972, p. 62.</ref> {{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=110|ps=}} <!--When Sri Aurobindo became involved with Congress and ''Vande Mataram'', Barin had continued to meet patriotic youngsters for recruitment for such a plan.{{clarify|reason=what plan?}}--> In 1907, Barin introduced Aurobindo to Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a Maharashtrian yogi. Aurobindo was influenced by the guidance he got from the yogi, who had instructed Aurobindo to depend on an inner guide and any kind of external guru or guidance would not be required.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=142–143|ps=}}

In 1910 Aurobindo withdrew himself from all political activities and went into hiding at [[Chandannagar]] in the house of [[Motilal Roy]], while the British colonial government were attempting to prosecute him for sedition on the basis of a signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in ''Karmayogin''. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a [[French colony]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=101|ps=}} The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.

=== Pondicherry (1910–1950) ===
In Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo dedicated himself to his spiritual and philosophical pursuits. In 1914, after four years of secluded yoga, he started a monthly philosophical magazine called ''[[Arya (journal)|Arya]]''. This ceased publication in 1921. Many years later, he revised some of these works before they were published in book form. Some of the book series derived out of this publication was ''The Life Divine'', ''The Synthesis of Yoga'', ''Essays on The Gita'', ''The Secret of The Veda'', ''Hymns to the Mystic Fire'', ''The Upanishads'', ''The Renaissance in India'', ''War and [[Self-determination]]'', ''The Human Cycle'', ''The Ideal of Human Unity'' and ''The Future Poetry'' were published in this magazine.{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|pp=31–33|ps=}}

At the beginning of his stay at Pondicherry, there were few followers, but with time their numbers grew, resulting in the formation of the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] in 1926.<ref name="Sketch">{{citation |title=Sri Aurobindo: A Life Sketch |series=Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library |volume=30 |url=http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/sriauro/life_sketch.php |access-date=1 January 2013 |archive-date=11 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311184542/http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/sriauro/life_sketch.php |url-status=dead }}</ref> From 1926 he started to sign himself as ''Sri Aurobindo'', ''[[Sri]]'' being commonly used as an [[honorific]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=347|ps=: Sri Aurobindo without the surname seems to have first appeared in print in articles published in Chandernagore in 1920. It did not catch on at that time. He first signed his name Sri Aurobindo in March 1926, but continued to use Sri Aurobindo Ghose for a year or two.}}
[[File:Aurobindodeath.JPG|thumb|right|245x245px|Sri Aurobindo on his deathbed 5 December 1950]]
For some time afterwards, his main literary output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples. His letters, most of which were written in the 1930s, numbered in the several thousand. Many were brief comments made in the margins of his disciple's notebooks in answer to their questions and reports of their spiritual practice—others extended to several pages of carefully composed explanations of practical aspects of his teachings. These were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of ''Letters on Yoga.'' In the late 1930s, he resumed work on a poem he had started earlier—he continued to expand and revise this poem for the rest of his life.{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|pp=20–26|ps=}} It became perhaps his greatest literary achievement, ''[[Savitri (book)|Savitri]]'', an epic spiritual poem in [[blank verse]] of approximately 24,000 lines.{{sfnp|Yadav|2007|p=31|ps=: "the fame of Sri Aurobindo mainly rests upon Savitri which is considered as his magnum opus&nbsp;...

Sri Aurobindo considered her his spiritual equal and collaborator. After 24 November 1926, when Sri Aurobindo retired into seclusion, he left it to her to plan, build and run the ashram, the community of disciples which had gathered around them. Sometime later, when families with children joined the ashram, she established and supervised the [[Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education]] with its experiments in the field of education. When he died in 1950, she continued their spiritual work, directed the ashram, and guided their disciples.{{sfnp|Jones|Ryan|2007|pp=292–293|ps=}}

=== Introduction ===
Sri Aurobindo's concept of the Integral Yoga system is described in his books, ''The Synthesis of Yoga'' and ''The Life Divine''. {{sfnp|McDermott|1994|p=281|ps=}} ''The Life Divine'' is a compilation of essays published serially in ''Arya.''

Sri Aurobindo argues that divine ''[[Brahman]]'' manifests as empirical reality through ''[[līlā]],'' or divine play. Instead of positing that the world we experience is an illusion (''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'')'','' Aurobindo argues that world can evolve and become a new world with new species, far above the human species just as human species have evolved after the animal species. As such he argued that the end goal of spiritual practice could not merely be a liberation from the world into Samadhi but would also be that of descent of the Divine into the world in order to transform it into a Divine existence. Thus, this constituted the purpose of Integral Yoga.<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Synthesis of Yoga.'' Lotus Press, 1996. P. 7-8</ref> Regarding the involution of consciousness in matter, he wrote that: "This descent, this sacrifice of the Purusha, the Divine Soul submitting itself to Force and Matter so that it may inform and illuminate them is the seed of redemption of this world of Inconscience and Ignorance."<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Synthesis of Yoga.'' Lotus Press, 1996. p. 106.</ref>

Sri Aurobindo believed that [[Darwinism]] merely describes a phenomenon of the evolution of matter into life, but does not explain the reason behind it, while he finds life to be already present in matter, because all of existence is a manifestation of ''Brahman''. He argues that nature (which he interpreted as divine) has evolved life out of matter and the mind out of life. All of existence, he argues, is attempting to manifest to the level of the supermind – that evolution [[teleology|had a purpose]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=5|ps=}} He stated that he found the task of understanding the [[Metaphysics|nature of reality]] arduous and difficult to justify by immediate tangible results.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}

=== Supermind ===
{{Main|Supermind (integral yoga)}}
At the centre of Sri Aurobindo's metaphysical system is the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world.<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Life Divine'' Lotus Press, 1990. P. 132.</ref> Sri Aurobindo claims that the supermind is not completely alien to us and can be realized within ourselves as it is always present within mind since the latter is in reality identical with the former and contains it as a potentiality within itself.<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Life Divine'' Lotus Press, 1990., P. 132-133</ref> Sri Aurobindo does not portray supermind as an original invention of his own but believes it can be found in the Vedas and that the Vedic Gods represent powers of the supermind.<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Life Divine'' Lotus Press, 1990., P. 134</ref> In ''The Integral Yoga'' he declares that "By the supermind is meant the full Truth-Consciousness of the Divine Nature in which there can be no place for the principle of division and ignorance; it is always a full light and knowledge superior to all mental substance or mental movement."<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Integral Yoga.''Lotus Press, 1993. P. 65.</ref> Supermind is a bridge between Sachchidananda and the lower manifestation and it is only through the supramental that mind, life and body can be spiritually transformed as opposed to through Sachchidananda<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Integral Yoga.''Lotus Press, 1993., P. 65-655.</ref> The descent of supermind will mean the creation of a supramental race<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Integral Yoga.''Lotus Press, 1993., P. 68.</ref>

=== Affinity with Western philosophy ===
In his writings, talks, and letters Sri Aurobindo has referred to several European philosophers with whose basic concepts he was familiar, commenting on their ideas and discussing the question of affinity to his own line of thought. Thus, he wrote a long essay on the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]]<ref>Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo (CWSA) vol. 13, ''Essays in Philosophy and Yoga'', Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram 1995, pp. 215–58</ref> and mentioned especially [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Nietzsche]] and [[Bergson]] as thinkers in whom he was interested because of their more intuitive approach.{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|ps= Ch. 2–4, 7 and 8}} On the other hand, he felt little attraction for the philosophy of [[Kant]] or [[Hegel]].<ref>CWSA vol. 36, ''Autobiographical Notes'', p. 112.</ref> Several studies<ref>One of the more comprehensive titles is: K.D. Sethna. ''The Spirituality of the Future. A Search apropos of R.C. Zaehner’s Study in Sri Aurobindo and Teilhard de Chardin.'' London 1981</ref> have shown a remarkable closeness to the evolutionary thought of [[Teilhard de Chardin]], whom he did not know, whereas the latter came to know of Sri Aurobindo at a late stage. After reading some chapters of ''The Life Divine'', he is reported to have said that Sri Aurobindo's vision of evolution was basically the same as his own, though stated for Asian readers.{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=0127}}<ref>Sethna, K.D. (1981). ''The Spirituality of the Future. A Search apropos of R.C. Zaehner’s Study in Sri Aurobindo and Teilhard de Chardin.'' Fairleigh Dickinson University Press. p. 257. {{ISBN|978-1611470703}}.</ref>

Several scholars have discovered significant similarities in the thought of Sri Aurobindo and Hegel. Steve Odin has discussed this subject comprehensively in a comparative study.<ref>''Sri Aurobindo and Hegel on the Involution-Evolution of Absolute Spirit.'' Philosophy East and West, Vol. 31, No. 2 (Apr. 1981), pp. 179–191</ref> Odin writes that Sri Aurobindo "has appropriated Hegel’s notion of an Absolute Spirit and employed it to radically restructure the architectonic framework of the ancient Hindu Vedanta system in contemporary terms."<ref>Odin, p.179. (Sri Aurobindo himself denied to be influenced by Hegel. See A.B. Purani, ''Evening Talks with Sri Aurobindo.'' Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram 2001, p. 106)</ref> In his analysis Odin arrives at the conclusion that "both philosophers similarly envision world creation as the progressive self-manifestation and evolutionary ascent of a universal consciousness in its journey toward Self-realization."<ref name="Odin, p. 186">Odin, p. 186</ref> He points out that in contrast to the deterministic and continuous dialectal unfolding of Absolute Reason by the mechanism of thesis-antithesis-synthesis or affirmation-negation-integration, "Sri Aurobindo argues for a creative, emergent mode of evolution."<ref name="Odin, p. 186"/> In his résumé Odin states that Sri Aurobindo has overcome the ahistorical world-vision of traditional Hinduism and presented a concept which allows for a genuine advance and novelty.<ref>Odin, p. 190</ref>

=== Importance of the Upanishads ===
Although Sri Aurobindo was familiar with the most important lines of thought in Western philosophy, he did not acknowledge their influence on his own writings.<ref>''Evening Talks with Sri Aurobindo'', p. 106</ref> He wrote that his philosophy "was formed first by the study of the [[Upanishads]] and the Gita … They were the basis of my first practice of Yoga." With the help of his readings he tried to move on to actual experience, "and it was on this experience that later on I founded my philosophy, not on ideas themselves."<ref>CWSA vol. 36, ''Autobiographical Writings'', p. 113</ref>

He assumes that the seers of the Upanishads had basically the same approach and gives some details of his vision of the past in a long passage in ''The Renaissance of India''. "The Upanishads have been the acknowledged source of numerous profound philosophies and religions", he writes. Even [[Buddhism]] with all its developments was only a "restatement" from a new standpoint and with fresh terms. And, furthermore, the ideas of the Upanishads "can be rediscovered in much of the thought of [[Pythagoras]] and Plato and form the profound part of [[Neo-platonism]] and [[Gnosticism]] ..." Finally, the larger part of German metaphysics "is little more in substance than an intellectual development of great realities more spiritually seen in this ancient teaching."<ref>CWSA, vol. 20, p. 330</ref> When once he was asked by a disciple whether Plato got some of his ideas from Indian books, he responded that though something of the philosophy of India got through "by means of Pythagoras and others", he assumed that Plato got most of his ideas from intuition.<ref>CWSA vol. 27, ''Letters on Poetry and Art'', p. 520.</ref>

Sri Aurobindo's indebtedness to the Indian tradition also becomes obvious through his placing a large number of quotations from the [[Rig Veda]], the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavadgita]] at the beginning of the chapters in ''The Life Divine'', showing the connection of his own thought to [[Veda]] and [[Vedanta]].{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=10}}{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=276}}

The ''Isha Upanishad'' is considered to be one of the most important and more accessible writings of Sri Aurobindo.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=267}} Before he published his final translation and analysis, he wrote ten incomplete commentaries.<ref>CWSA vol. 17, Publisher’s Note</ref> In a key passage he points out that the Brahman or Absolute is both the Stable and the Moving. "We must see it in eternal and immutable Spirit and in all the changing manifestations of universe and relativity."{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=267}}<ref>CWSA 17:30</ref> Sri Aurobindo's biographer K.R.S. Iyengar quotes R.S. Mugali as stating that Sri Aurobindo might have obtained in this Upanishad the thought-seed which later grew into ''The Life Divine''.<ref>K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar (1972) ''Sri Aurobindo – A Biography and a history.'' Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram. p. 441.</ref>

=== Synthesis and integration ===
[[Sisir Kumar Maitra]], who was a leading exponent of Sri Aurobindo's Philosophy,{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=85}} has referred to the issue of external influences and written that Sri Aurobindo does not mention names, but "as one reads his books one cannot fail to notice how thorough is his grasp of the great Western philosophers of the present age..." Although he is Indian one should not "underrate the influence of Western thought upon him. This influence is there, very clearly visible, but Sri Aurobindo... has not allowed himself to be dominated by it. He has made full use of Western thought, but he has made use of it for the purpose of building up his own system..."<ref>Maitra, S.K. (1988): ''The Meeting of the East and the West in Sri Aurobindo’s Philosophy.'' Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram. p. 49. {{ISBN|978-8170580782}}</ref> Thus Maitra, like Steve Odin,{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=78}} sees Sri Aurobindo not only in the tradition and context of Indian, but also Western philosophy and assumes he may have adopted some elements from the latter for his synthesis.

R. Puligandla supports this viewpoint in his book ''Fundamentals of Indian Philosophy''. He describes Sri Aurobindo's philosophy as "an original synthesis of the Indian and Western traditions." "He integrates in a unique fashion the great social, political and scientific achievements of the modern West with the ancient and profound spiritual insights of [[Hinduism]]. The vision that powers the life divine of Aurobindo is none other than the Upanishadic vision of the unity of all existence."<ref name=Puligandla>{{cite book|author=Ramakrishna Puligandla|title=Fundamentals of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJ_0OAAACAAJ|year=1997|publisher=D.K. Printworld|isbn=978-81-246-0087-0|pages=267–268|access-date=19 December 2018|archive-date=5 February 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240205053258/https://books.google.com/books?id=LJ_0OAAACAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref>

Puligandla also discusses Sri Aurobindo's critical position vis-à-vis [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]<ref>For Sri Aurobindo’s critique, see, for instance, CWSA vol. 17, ''Isha Upanishad'', pp. 498–99. There he says that Shankara’s world-negative approach "has overshadowed for centuries the lives and souls of hundreds of millions of human beings." However, he also recognized him as "one of the mightiest of metaphysical intellects." (''Isha Upanishad'', p. 497)</ref> and his thesis that the latter's Vedanta is a world-negating philosophy, as it teaches that the world is unreal and illusory. From Puligandla's standpoint this is a misrepresentation of Shankara's position, which may have been caused by Sri Aurobindo's endeavour to synthesize Hindu and Western modes of thought, identifying Shankara's Mayavada with the subjective idealism of [[George Berkeley]].<ref name=Puligandla/>

However, Sri Aurobindo's critique of Shankara is supported by U. C. Dubey in his paper titled ''Integralism: The Distinctive Feature of Sri Aurobindo’s Philosophy.'' He points out that Sri Aurobindo's system presents an integral view of Reality where there is no opposition between the Absolute and its creative force, as they are actually one. Furthermore, he refers to Sri Aurobindo's conception of the supermind as the mediatory principle between the Absolute and the finite world and quotes S.K. Maitra stating that this conception "is the pivot round which the whole of Sri Aurobindo’s philosophy moves."<ref name=Dubey>U. C. Dubey (2007) "Integralism the distinctive feature of Sri Aurobindo's philosophy", pp. 25–27, Ch. 2 in ''Understanding Thoughts of Sri Aurobindo''. Indrani Sanyal and Krishna Roy (eds.). D K Printworld. New Delhi. {{ISBN|978-81-246-0402-1}}</ref>

Dubey proceeds to analyse the approach of the Shankarites and believes that they follow an inadequate kind of logic that does not do justice to the challenge of tackling the problem of the Absolute, which cannot be known by finite reason. With the help of the finite reason, he says, "we are bound to determine the nature of reality as one or many, being or becoming. But Sri Aurobindo's Integral Advaitism reconciles all apparently different aspects of Existence in an all-embracing unity of the Absolute." Next, Dubey explains that for Sri Aurobindo there is a higher reason, the "logic of the infinite" in which his integralism is rooted.<ref name=Dubey/>

=== Influence ===
His influence has been wide-ranging. In India, [[Shishir Kumar Maitra|S. K. Maitra]], [[Anilbaran Roy]] and [[D. P. Chattopadhyaya]] commented on Sri Aurobindo's work. Writers on [[esotericism]] and traditional wisdom, such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Paul Brunton]], and [[Rene Guenon]], all saw him as an authentic representative of the Indian spiritual tradition.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=379|ps=}} Though [[Rene Guenon]] thought Sri Aurobindo's thoughts were betrayed by some of his followers and that some works published under his name were not authentic, since not traditional.<ref>René Guénon, Etude sur l'hindouisme, Les Éditions traditionnelles, 1989, nouvelle édition, p268</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/guenon_rene/Etudes_sur_hindouisme/Etudes_sur_hindouisme.pdf |title=Études sur l'hindouisme |first=René |last=Guénon |date= |access-date=2022-02-28 |archive-date=25 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925122339/http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/guenon_rene/Etudes_sur_hindouisme/Etudes_sur_hindouisme.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Haridas Chaudhuri]] and [[Frederic Spiegelberg]]<ref>Haridas Chaudhuri and Frederic Spiegelberg (1960) ''The integral philosophy of Sri Aurobindo: a commemorative symposium'', Allen & Unwin.</ref> were among those who were inspired by Aurobindo, who worked on the newly formed [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in [[San Francisco]]. Soon after, Chaudhuri and his wife Bina established the Cultural Integration Fellowship, from which later emerged the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]].<ref>"From the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] to the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]]" [http://www.well.com/~davidu/aaas-ciis.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130160140/http://www.well.com/~davidu/aaas-ciis.html|date=30 January 2012}}</ref>

Sri Aurobindo influenced [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] to take an initiative of dedicating to Indian National Movement full-time. Bose writes, "The illustrious example of Arabindo Ghosh looms large before my vision. I feel that I am ready to make the sacrifice which that example demands of me."<ref>{{cite book|author=Ratna Ghosh|title=Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian Freedom Struggle: Subhas Chandra Bose : his ideas and vision|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1QPWD0iBlQC&pg=PA42|year=2006|publisher=Deep & Deep|isbn=978-81-7629-843-8|pages=42–|access-date=19 December 2018|archive-date=5 February 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240205053257/https://books.google.com/books?id=W1QPWD0iBlQC&pg=PA42|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] was heavily inspired by Satprem's writings about Sri Aurobindo during a week in May 1968, a time at which the composer was undergoing a personal crisis and had found Sri Aurobindo's philosophies were relevant to his feelings. After this experience, Stockhausen's music took a completely different turn, focusing on mysticism, that was to continue until the end of his career.{{sfnp|O'Mahony|2001|ps=}}

[[Jean Gebser]] acknowledged Sri Aurobindo's influence on his work and referred to him several times in his writings. Thus, in ''The Invisible Origin'' he quotes a long passage from ''The Synthesis of Yoga''.<ref>''Sri Aurobindo and European Philosophy'', pp. 155–56</ref> Gebser believes that he was "in some way brought into the extremely powerful spiritual field of force radiating through Sri Aurobindo."{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=155}}<ref>''Der unsichtbare Ursprung'', Olten 1970, p. 96.</ref> In his title ''Asia Smiles Differently'' he reports about his visit to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and meeting with the Mother whom he calls an "exceptionally gifted person."{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=157}}<ref>''Asien lächelt anders'', Frankfurt 1968, p. 112</ref>

After meeting Sri Aurobindo in Pondicherry in 1915, the Danish author and artist [[Johannes Hohlenberg]] published one of the first Yoga titles in Europe and later on wrote two essays on Sri Aurobindo. He also published extracts from ''The Life Divine'' in Danish translation.<ref>Bracker, Klaus J. (2018). ''Veda and Living Logos. Anthroposophy and Integral Yoga.''

The Chilenean [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Gabriela Mistral]] called Sri Aurobindo "a unique synthesis of a [[scholar]], a [[theologian]] and one who is enlightened."

[[William Irwin Thompson]] travelled to [[Auroville]] in 1972, where he met "The Mother". Thompson has called Sri Aurobindo's teaching on spirituality a "radical anarchism" and a "post-religious approach" and regards their work as having "...&nbsp;reached back into the Goddess culture of prehistory, and, in Marshall McLuhan's terms, 'culturally retrieved' the archetypes of the shaman and ''la sage femme''...&nbsp;" Thompson also writes that he experienced Shakti, or psychic power coming from The Mother on the night of her death in 1973.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thinking otherwise&nbsp;– From Religion to Post-Religious Spirituality: Conclusion |url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/Column/Thinking-Otherwise/On-Religion/Post-Religious-Spirituality-Conclusion/William-Irwin-Thompson |access-date=13 April 2014 |archive-date=7 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307025319/http://www.wildriverreview.com/column/thinking-otherwise/on-religion/post-religious-spirituality-conclusion/william-irwin-thompson |url-status=live }}</ref>

Sri Aurobindo's ideas about the further evolution of human capabilities influenced the thinking of [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]]&nbsp;– and indirectly, the [[human potential movement]], through Murphy's writings.{{sfnp|Kripal|2007|pp=60–63|ps=}}

The American philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] has called Sri Aurobindo "India's greatest modern philosopher sage"<ref>Ken Wilber, Foreword to A. S. Dalal (ed.), ''A Greater Psychology&nbsp;– An Introduction to the Psychological Thought of Sri Aurobindo'', Tarcher/Putnam, 2000.</ref> and has integrated some of his ideas into his philosophical vision. Wilber's interpretation of Aurobindo has been criticised by [[Rod Hemsell]].<ref>Rod Hemsell (January 2002).

=== Followers ===
The following authors, disciples and organisations trace their intellectual heritage back to, or have in some measure been influenced by, Sri Aurobindo and The Mother.
* [[Nolini Kanta Gupta]] (1889–1983) was one of Sri Aurobindo's senior disciples, and wrote extensively on philosophy, mysticism, and spiritual evolution based on the teaching of Sri Aurobindo and "The Mother".<ref>{{cite book |title=Sri Aurobindo: A Contemporary Reade |author=Sachidananda Mohanty|edition= 1 |year= 2008 |publisher= routeledge |location= New Delhi |isbn= 978-0-415-46093-4 |page= 36}}</ref>

=== Critics ===
* [[Adi Da]] finds that Sri Aurobindo's contributions were merely literary and cultural and had extended his political motivation into spirituality and human evolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beezone.com/DawnHorse/aurobindo.htm|title=Bubba Free John in India|date=4 August 1974|work=The Dawn Horse Magazine|access-date=6 March 2014|archive-date=21 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521130356/https://www.beezone.com/DawnHorse/aurobindo.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* [[N. R. Malkani]] finds Sri Aurobindo's theory of creation to be false, as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond normal human experiences. He says the theory is an intellectual response to a difficult problem and that Sri Aurobindo uses the trait of unpredictability in theorising and discussing things not based upon the truth of existence. Malkani says that awareness is already a reality and suggests there would be no need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sri Aurobindo's theory of evolution&nbsp;– a criticism by Prof. Malkani examined |url=http://www.drkcv.org/Books/kcv4chap_6.htm |access-date=6 February 2014 |archive-date=26 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210226221910/http://www.drkcv.org/Books/kcv4chap_6.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>
* [[Ken Wilber|Ken Wilber's]] interpretation of Sri Aurobindo's philosophy differed from the notion of dividing reality as a different level of matter, life, mind, overmind, supermind proposed by Sri Aurobindo in ''The Life Divine'', and terms them as higher- or lower-nested [[holon (philosophy)|holons]] and states that there is only a fourfold reality (a system of reality created by himself).<ref>{{cite web |title=Wilber's Critique of Sri Aurobindo |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/Wilber/Wilber_on_Aurobindo.html |access-date=13 October 2014 |archive-date=28 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728130234/http://www.kheper.net/topics/Wilber/Wilber_on_Aurobindo.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
* [[Rajneesh]] (Osho), in response to his devotees that "Sri Aurobindo says there is something more than the enlightenment of Gautam Buddha", stated that Sri Aurobindo "knows everything about enlightenment, but he is not enlightened."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oshosearch.net/Convert/Articles_Osho/Beyond_Enlightenment/Osho-Beyond-Enlightenment-00000017.html|title=Osho Beyond Enlightenment|work=Beyond Enlightenment|access-date=6 March 2014|archive-date=12 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112041015/http://oshosearch.net/Convert/Articles_Osho/Beyond_Enlightenment/Osho-Beyond-Enlightenment-00000017.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
