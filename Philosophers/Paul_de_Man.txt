'''Paul de Man''' (December 6, 1919 – December 21, 1983), born '''Paul Adolph Michel Deman''',{{sfn|Barish|2014|p=3}} was a [[Belgium|Belgian]]-born [[Literary criticism|literary critic]] and [[Literary theory|literary theorist]]. He was known particularly for his importation of German and French [[philosophy|philosophical]] approaches into Anglo-American literary studies and critical theory. Along with [[Jacques Derrida]], he was part of an influential critical movement that went beyond traditional interpretation of literary texts to reflect on the epistemological difficulties inherent in any textual, literary, or critical activity.<ref>[https://magazine.atavist.com/stranger-than-fiction-epoch-times-falun-gong-trump-election-2020/ Stranger Than Fiction] The Atavist Magazine. 2020.</ref> This approach aroused considerable opposition, which de Man attributed to "resistance" inherent in the difficult enterprise of literary interpretation itself.<ref>{{cite book|last=de Man|first=Paul|year=1982|title=The Resistance to Theory|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|pages=3–20}}</ref>

After his death, de Man became a subject of further controversy when his history of writing pro-Nazi and anti-Jewish propaganda for the wartime edition of ''[[Le Soir]]'', a major Belgian newspaper during [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation]], came to light.

== Biography ==
He began his teaching career in the United States at [[Bard College]] where he taught [[French literature]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Spikes|first=Michael Paul|title=Understanding Contemporary American Literary Theory, Revised Edition|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=2003|isbn=1-57003-498-2|pages=19|language=en}}</ref> He completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1960, then taught at [[Cornell University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], and the [[University of Zurich]].{{sfn|Barish|2014|pp=xv, xx}} He joined the faculty in French and Comparative Literature at [[Yale University]], where he was considered part of the [[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale School]] of [[Deconstruction]]. At the time of his death from cancer, he was [[Sterling Professor]] of the Humanities and chairman of the Department of Comparative Literature at Yale. De Man oversaw the dissertations of [[Gayatri Spivak]] (at Cornell), [[Barbara Johnson]] (at Yale),{{citation needed lead|date=May 2014}} [[Samuel Weber]] (at Cornell), and many other noted scholars.

After his death, a researcher uncovered some two hundred previously unknown articles which de Man had written in his early twenties for Belgian [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]]{{sfn|Barish|2014|p=needed}}{{page needed|date=January 2020}} newspapers during [[World War II]], some of them implicitly and two explicitly [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]]. These, in combination with revelations about his domestic life and financial history, caused a scandal and provoked a reconsideration of his life and work.<ref name=Atlas1988 />

==Early life==
Paul de Man was born to a family of artisans of nineteenth-century Belgium and by the time of his birth, his family was prominent among the new [[bourgeoisie]] in [[Antwerp]].{{sfn|Barish|2014|p=4}} He was the son of Robert de Man, a manufacturer and Magdalena de Braey.<ref name=":0" /> His maternal great-grandfather was the noted Flemish poet [[Jan van Beers (poet)|Jan Van Beers]], and the family spoke French at home. His uncle [[Henri de Man]] (Dutch: Hendrik) was a famous [[socialist]] theorist and politician, who became a Nazi-[[Collaboration with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy|collaborator]] during [[World War II]]. He played an important part in the decisions made by De Man during the Nazi occupation of Belgium.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McQuillian|first=Martin|title=Paul de Man|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-1-134-60911-6|location=Oxon|pages=100}}</ref> Paul's father, Robert ("Bob") de Man, was a moderately successful businessman whose firm manufactured X-ray equipment. De Man's father and his mother, Madeleine, who were first cousins, married over the family's opposition. The marriage proved unhappy.

De Man's early life was difficult and shadowed by tragedy. His mother Madeleine's first pregnancy with her oldest son Hendrik ("Rik," b. 1915) coincided with the intense German bombings of [[World War I]] and strained her physical and mental health. The stillbirth of a daughter two years later pushed her into intermittent but lifelong suicidal [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. She was psychologically fragile and had to be watched. The family walked on eggshells and "Bob" de Man found solace with other women. In contrast to Rik, who was backward and a failure in school, Paul dealt with his difficult home life by becoming a brilliant student and accomplished athlete. He was enrolled in the Dutch-speaking cohort of boys admitted to the prestigious and highly competitive Royal Athenaeum of Antwerp. There, he followed his father's career path in choosing to study science and engineering, consistently receiving top marks in all subjects and graduating at the top of his class. He took no courses in literature or philosophy but developed a strong extracurricular interest in both as well as in religious mysticism. In 1936, his brother Rik de Man was killed at the age of 21 when his bicycle was struck by a train at a railroad crossing. The following year, it was Paul, then seventeen, who discovered the body of their mother, who had hanged herself a month before the anniversary of Rik's death.{{sfn|Barish|2014|p=45}}

That fall Paul enrolled in the [[Free University of Brussels (1834–1969)|Free University of Brussels]]. He wrote for student magazines and continued to take courses in science and engineering. For stability he turned to his uncle Henri as a patron and surrogate emotional father, later on several occasions telling people Henri was his real father and his real father was his uncle. He fathered a son with [[Romanians|Romanian]]-born Anaïde Baraghian, the wife of his good friend, Gilbert Jaeger. They lived in a ''[[ménage à trois]]'' until August 1942, when Baraghian left her husband. Paul married her in 1944, and the couple had two more sons together.<ref>{{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Wendy|title=The Scandal of Pleasure: Art in an Age of Fundamentalism|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=1997|page=191}}</ref>

De Man, Baraghian and Jaeger fled to the south of France near the Spanish border when the Nazis occupied Belgium in 1940.{{sfn|Barish|2014|pp=99–103}} Henri, who by then was a self-avowed fascist, welcomed the Nazi invaders, whom he saw as essential for instituting his brand of socialism.<ref>{{cite web|first=James|last=Tuttleton|title=Quisling criticism: the case of Paul de Man: a review of David Lehman, 'Signs of the Times: Deconstruction & the Fall of Paul de Man'|website=New Criterion|date=April 1991|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Quisling-criticism--the-case-of-Paul-de-Man-5464}}</ref>{{update after|2014|5|3}}<ref>{{cite book|author1=J.

Occupied Belgium|publisher=Centre de recherche et d’information socio-politiques (CRISP)|location=Bruxelles|year=1980}}</ref> For a year, Henri de Man was appointed as de facto puppet Prime Minister of Belgium under the Nazis. Some believed that he used his influence to secure his nephew a position as an occasional cultural critic for ''[[Le Soir]]'', the influential Belgian [[French-language]] newspaper. After contributing an essay, "The Jews in Present-Day Literature", to ''Le Soir volé'''s notorious anti-Semitic attack of March 4, 1941, de Man became its official book reviewer and a cultural critic. Later he contributed to the Flemish daily ''Het Vlaamsche Land''; both publications were vehemently anti-Semitic when under Nazi control. As a cultural critic, de Man would contribute hundreds of articles and reviews to these publications. His writings supported the Germanic ideology and the triumph of Germany in the war, while never referring directly to Hitler himself. In spite of that he maintained friendships with individual Jews.<ref>{{harvnb|Barish|2014}}, e.g., his contacts with G. Goriély, p. 142 and E. Sluszny, pp. 153, 154</ref>

Holding three different jobs, de Man became very highly paid, but he lost all three between November 1942 and April 1943, failures that resulted from a combination of losing a coup he had launched against one employer and his own incompetence as a businessman at another.{{citation_needed|date=January 2024}} After this, de Man went into hiding; the [[Belgian Resistance]] had now begun assassinating prominent Belgian pro-Nazis. He had lost his protection in late 1942, when Henri, mistrusted by his collaborators on the right and himself marked for death as a traitor by the Belgian Resistance, went into exile.

De Man spent the rest of the war in seclusion reading American and French literature and philosophy and organizing a translation into Dutch of ''[[Moby Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]], which he published in 1945. He would be interrogated by prosecutor Roger Vinçotte,{{sfn|Barish|2014|p=194}} but not charged after the war. Henri de Man was [[Tried in absentia|tried and convicted ''in absentia'']] for [[treason]]; he died in Switzerland in 1953, after crashing his car into an oncoming train, an accident that was almost certainly a suicide.<ref name=Atlas1988>{{cite news |author=James Atlas |title=The Case of Paul de Man |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 28, 1988 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/28/magazine/the-case-of-paul-de-man.html?pagewanted=all |access-date=3 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Rudnytsky|date=1994|chapter=Rousseau's Confessions, De Man's Excuses|editor1=Mary Donaldson-Evans|editor2=Lucienne Frappier-Mazur|editor3=Gerald Prince|title=Autobiography, Historiography, Rhetoric: A Festschrift in Honor of Frank Paul Bowman|location=Amsterdam|publisher=Rodopi|pages=215–243|isbn=978-9-05183-576-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wfwHC3G0LOIC|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Frank |last=Kermode |title=Paul de Man's Abyss |journal=London Review of Books |date=March 16, 1989 |volume=11 |issue=6 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v11/n06/frank-kermode/paul-de-mans-abyss}}</ref>{{update after|2014|5|3}}

==Post-war years==
In 1948, de Man left Belgium and emigrated to [[New York City]].<ref name=Atlas1988/> He had fled as an exile to avoid what became two trials for criminal and financial misdeeds (thefts of money from investors in a publishing company he ran) for which he was convicted ''in absentia'' to five years of imprisonment and heavy fines.{{sfn|Barish|2014|p=192}} Baraghian sailed with their three young sons to [[Argentina]], where her parents had recently immigrated. De Man found work stocking books at the Doubleday Bookstore at New York City's [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]]. From there he wrote to his friend [[Georges Bataille]], a French philosopher, and through him, he met [[Dwight Macdonald]], a key figure on the New York intellectual and literary scene. At Macdonald's apartment, de Man met the celebrated novelist [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]]. McCarthy recommended de Man to her friend [[Artine Artinian]], a professor of French at [[Bard College]], as a temporary replacement while Artinian spent the academic year 1949–50 in France as a [[Fulbright fellow]].

<blockquote>De Man was to teach Mr. Artinian's courses, advise Mr. Artinian's advisees, and move into Mr. Artinian's house. By December [1949], de Man had married one of the advisees, a French major named Patricia Kelley, and when the first Mrs. de Man turned up with their three young boys, Hendrik, Robert, and Marc, in the spring of 1950, Patricia de Man [sic] was pregnant.<ref name="lehman"/></blockquote>

De Man persuaded the devastated Baraghian to accept a sum of money, agree to a divorce, and return to Argentina. She, however, surprised him when she left the eldest boy with him, while he surprised her when his first check proved worthless. The boy was raised by Kelley's parents while she took the younger ones back to Argentina with a promise of [[child support]] that de Man was never to honor.<ref name="lehman">{{cite web |first=David |last=Lehman |title=Paul de Man: The Plot Thickens |work=The New York Times |date=May 24, 1992 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/24/books/paul-de-man-the-plot-thickens.html?pagewanted=all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Many-Betrayals-of-Paul-de/142505/ |title=The Many Betrayals of Paul de Man |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=21 October 2013 }}</ref>{{update after|2014|5|3}}

A heavily fictionalized account of this period of de Man's life is the basis of [[Henri Thomas]]'s 1964 novel ''Le Parjure'' (''The Perjurer'').<ref>{{cite book|contributor=Lindsay Waters|contribution=Paul de Man: Life and Works|author=Paul de Man|title=Critical Writings: 1953–1978|editor=Lindsay Waters|location=Minneapolis|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|date=1989|page=lxiv}} See also {{cite book|author=Jacques Derrida|chapter=Le Parjure: ''Perhaps'', Storytelling and Lying|pages=[https://archive.org/details/withoutalibimeri00derr/page/n195 161]–201|title=Without Alibi|url=https://archive.org/details/withoutalibimeri00derr|url-access=limited|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2002}}</ref> His life also provides the basis for [[Bernhard Schlink]]'s 2006 novel, translated as "Homecoming". De Man married Kelley a first time in June 1950, but did not tell her that he had not actually gotten a divorce and that the marriage was [[bigamy|bigamous]]. They underwent a second marriage ceremony in August 1960, when his divorce from Baraghian was finalized, and later had a third ceremony in Ithaca.<ref name=Smallwood2014>{{cite magazine|url=http://harpers.org/archive/2014/03/new-books-56/|title=New Books|author=Christine Smallwood|date=March 2014|magazine=Harper's Magazine|volume=March 2014}}</ref> In addition to their son, Michael, born while the couple was at Bard College, they had a daughter, Patsy. The couple remained together until de Man's death, aged 64, in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

==Academic career==

The de Mans moved to Boston, where Paul earned money teaching conversational French at [[Berlitz Corporation|Berlitz]] and did translations assisted by Patricia de Man; he also gave private French lessons to [[Harvard]] student [[Henry Kissinger]], then running a small center and publication of his own.{{sfn|Barish|2014|pp=326-327}} There, de Man met [[Harry Levin]], the Harvard Professor of Comparative Literature, and "was invited to join an informal literary seminar that met at Levin's house (alongside, e.g., [[George Steiner]] and [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]]). By the fall of 1952, he was officially admitted to graduate study in comparative literature."<ref name=Brooks2014>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/apr/03/strange-case-paul-de-man/?insrc=hpss|title=The Strange Case of Paul de Man|author=Peter Brooks|date=April 3, 2014|magazine=The New York Review of Books}}</ref> In 1954 someone sent Harvard an anonymous letter denouncing de Man as a wartime collaborator and questioning his immigration status (a letter not surviving, and known only on the basis of de Man's response to it).{{sfn|Barish|2014|pp=347-360}} According to Harvard faculty members, de Man offered a thorough and more than satisfactory account of his immigration status and the nature of his political activities.<ref name=Brooks2014/> While he was writing his dissertation, de Man was awarded a prestigious appointment at the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]].{{sfn|Barish|2014|p=345}} In 1960, because his thesis was unsatisfactory to his mentors on several counts, and especially its philosophical approach, they were prepared to dismiss him, but he moved immediately to an advanced position at [[Cornell University]], where he was highly valued.{{sfn|Barish|2014|pp=423-425}}

[[Peter Brooks (writer)|Peter Brooks]], who was de Man's undergraduate student at Harvard, and later became his friend and colleague at Yale, wrote that rather than brand de Man as a confidence man, as his critics were inclined to do:

<blockquote>One might consider this a story of remarkable survival and success following the chaos of war, occupation, postwar migration, and moments of financial desperation: without any degrees to his name, de Man had impressed, among others, [[Georges Bataille]], Macdonald, McCarthy, and Levin, and entered the highest precincts of American academia. During the following decade, he contributed nine articles to the newly established ''[[New York Review]]'': astute and incisive short essays on major European writers—[[Hölderlin]], [[Gide]], [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Sartre]], [[Heidegger]], as well as [[Borges]]—that display notable cultural range and critical poise.<ref name=Brooks2014/></blockquote>

In 1966, de Man attended a conference on [[structuralism]] held at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where [[Jacques Derrida]] delivered his celebrated essay, "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences]]"; de Man and Derrida soon became fast friends.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Both were to become identified with [[Deconstruction]]. De Man came to reflect the influence primarily of [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and used deconstruction to study [[Romanticism]], both [[List of romantics|English]] and [[German Romanticism|German]], as well as French literature, specifically the works of [[William Wordsworth]], [[John Keats]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G .W. F. Hegel]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Friedrich Hoelderlin]], and [[Rainer Maria Rilke]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Following an appointment to a professorship in [[Zürich]], de Man returned to the United States in the 1970s to teach at Yale University, where he served for the rest of his career. At the time of his death of cancer at age 64, he was a [[Sterling Professor]] and chairman of the department of comparative literature at Yale.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Contributions to literary theory==

Although de Man's work in the 1960s differs from his later deconstructive endeavors, considerable continuity can also be discerned. In his 1967 essay "Criticism and Crisis" (included as the first chapter of ''Blindness and Insight''), he argues that because literary works are understood to be fictions rather than factual accounts, they exemplify the break between a [[Semiotics|sign and its meaning]]: literature "means" nothing, but critics resist this insight:

<blockquote>When modern critics think they are demystifying literature, they are in fact being demystified by it. But since this necessarily occurs in the form of a crisis, they are blind to what takes place within themselves. What they call anthropology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, is nothing but literature reappearing like the hydra's head in the very spot where it had been suppressed. The human mind will go through amazing feats to avoid facing 'the nothingness of human matters'.<ref>{{cite book|last=de Man|first=Paul|chapter=Criticism and Crisis|page=18|title=Blindness and Insight}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2020|reason=Which edition?}} The phrase "nothingness of human matters" – ''le néant des choses humaines'' – is from a well-known passage about the imagination from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s [[Julie, or the New Heloise|''Julie ou La Nouvelle Héloïse'']] (VI: VIII), which asserts that human happiness lies only in desire and not fulfillment: "The world of illusions is the only one worth inhabiting. Such is the vanity of human matters, outside the realm of the Self-Created Being, that nothing here is beautiful but what is not.</ref></blockquote>

De Man would later observe that, due to this resistance to acknowledging that literature does not "mean", English departments had become "large organizations in the service of everything except their own subject matter" ("The Return to Philology"). He said that the study of literature had become the art of applying [[psychology]], [[politics]], [[history]], [[philology]], or other disciplines to the literary text, in an effort to make the text "mean" something.

Among the central threads running through de Man's work is his attempt to tease out the tension between rhetoric (which de Man uses as a term to mean figural language and [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]]) and meaning, seeking moments in the text where linguistic forces "tie themselves into a knot which arrests the process of understanding."<ref>de Man, Paul, "Shelley Disfigured", in Bloom, Harold, et al. ''Deconstruction and Criticism'' (New York, Continuum: 1979), p. 44.</ref> De Man's earlier essays from the 1960s, collected in ''Blindness and Insight'',<ref>{{cite book|last=de Man|first=Paul|title=Blindness and Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2020|reason=Which edition? The following is an incorrect mix of 1st and 2nd editions: (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1971)}}</ref> represent an attempt to seek these [[paradox]]es in the texts of [[New Criticism]] and move beyond [[Formalism (literature)|formalism]]. One of De Man's central topoi is of the blindness on which these critical readings are predicated, that the "insight seems instead to have been gained from a negative movement that animates the critic's thought, an unstated principle that leads his language away from its asserted stand...as if the very possibility of assertion had been put into question."<ref>{{cite book|last=de Man|first=Paul|chapter=The Rhetoric of Blindness|title=Blindness and Insight|page=103}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2020|reason=Which edition?}}</ref> Here de Man tries to undercut the notion of the poetic work as a unified, atemporal [[Symbol|icon]], a self-possessed repository of meaning freed from the [[Authorial intentionalism|intentionalist]] and affective fallacies. In de Man's argument, formalist and New Critical valorization of the "organic" nature of poetry is ultimately self-defeating: the notion of the verbal icon is undermined by the irony and ambiguity inherent within it. Form ultimately acts as "both a creator and undoer of organic totalities", and "the final insight...annihilated the premises which led up to it."<ref>{{cite book|last=de Man|first=Paul|chapter=The Rhetoric of Blindness|title=Blindness and Insight|page=104}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2020|reason=Which edition?}}</ref>

{{Rhetoric}}

In ''Allegories of Reading'', de Man further explores the tensions arising in figural language in Nietzsche, Rousseau, Rilke, and Proust.{{sfn|de Man|1979}} In these essays, he concentrates on crucial passages which have a [[Metalinguistics|metalinguistic]] function or metacritical implications, particularly those where figural language has a dependency on classical philosophical oppositions ([[essence]]/accident, [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]]/[[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]], appearance/reality) which are so central to Western [[discourse]]. Many of the essays in this volume attempt to undercut figural totalization, the notion that one can control or dominate a discourse or phenomenon through [[metaphor]]. In de Man's discussion of Nietzsche's ''The Birth of Tragedy'', for instance, he claims that "genetic" conceptions of history appearing in the text are undercut by the [[rhetoric]]al strategies Nietzsche employs: "the deconstruction does not occur between statements, as in a logical refutation or a dialectic, but happens instead between, on the one hand, metalinguistic statements about the rhetorical nature of language and, on the other hand, a rhetorical [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] that puts these statements into question."{{sfn|de Man|1979|p=98}} For de Man, an "allegory of reading" emerges when texts are subjected to such scrutiny and reveal this tension; a reading wherein the text reveals its own assumptions about language, and in so doing dictates a statement about [[undecidable problem|undecidability]], the difficulties inherent in totalization, their own readability, or the "limitations of textual authority."{{sfn|de Man|1979|p=99}}

De Man is also known for his readings of English and [[German Romanticism|German]] [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and post-Romantic poetry and philosophy (''The Rhetoric of Romanticism''), and concise and deeply ironic essays. Specifically noteworthy is his critical dismantling of the Romantic ideology and the linguistic assumptions which underlie it. His arguments are outlined below. First, de Man seeks to deconstruct the privileged claims in Romanticism of [[symbol]] over [[allegory]], and [[metaphor]] over [[metonymy]]. In his reading, because of the implication of [[Self-concept|self-identity]] and wholeness which is inherent in the Romantics' conception of metaphor, when this self-identity decomposes, so also does the means of overcoming the dualism between [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]], which Romantic metaphor sought to transcend. In de Man's reading, to compensate for this inability, Romanticism constantly relies on allegory to attain the wholeness established by the totality of the symbol.<ref>{{cite book|last=de Man|first=Paul|chapter=The Rhetoric of Temporality|title=Blindness and Insight}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2020|reason=Which edition?}}</ref>

In addition, in his essay "[[The Resistance to Theory]]", which explores the task and philosophical bases of [[literary theory]], de Man uses the example of the classical ''[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]'' of grammar, rhetoric, and logic to argue that the use of linguistic sciences in literary theory and criticism (i.e. a [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] approach) was able to harmonize the logical and grammatical dimension of literature, but only at the expense of effacing the rhetorical elements of texts which presented the greatest interpretive demands. He posits that the resistance to theory is the resistance to reading, thus the resistance to theory is theory itself. Or the resistance to theory is what constitutes the possibility and existence of theory. Taking up the example of the title of Keats's poem ''The Fall of Hyperion'', de Man draws out an irreducible interpretive undecidability which bears strong affinities to the same term in Derrida's work and some similarity to the notion of incommensurability as developed by [[Jean-François Lyotard]] in ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'' and ''[[The Differend]]''. De Man argues that the recurring motive of theoretical readings is to subsume these decisions under theoretical, futile generalizations, which are displaced in turn by harsh [[polemic]]s about theory.

==Influence and legacy==
De Man's influence on literary criticism was considerable, in part through his numerous and vocal disciples. Although much of his work brought to bear insights on literature drawn from German philosophers such as Kant and Heidegger, de Man also closely followed developments in contemporary [[French language|French]] literature, criticism, and theory.

Much of de Man's work was collected or published posthumously, for instance in his book ''Resistance to Theory'' which he complete shortly before his death, and a collection of essays, edited by his former Yale colleague Andrzej Warminski, was published by the [[University of Minnesota Press]] in 1996 under the title ''Aesthetic Ideology''.

"On the last day, [[Jean Stengers]], a historian at the Free University of Brussels, addressed a topic pointedly titled: "Paul de Man, a Collaborator?"<ref name=Atlas1988/> Then Georges Goriely, professor emeritus of sociology at the Free University of Brussels, rose to deliver what he called "A Personal Testimony":

<blockquote>M. Goriely began by extolling de Man, whom he had known intimately in his youth, as "a charming, humorous, modest, highly cultured" ''homme de lettres'' renowned in Belgian literary circles during their youth. Then the professor dropped his bombshell. De Man, he asserted, wasn't all that he appeared to be. He was "completely, almost pathologically, dishonest," a crook who had bankrupted his family. "Swindling, forging, lying were, at least at the time, second nature to him."<ref name=Atlas1988/> </blockquote>

The European press was in an uproar: "There were stories in La ''Quinzaine Litteraire'', the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', The ''(Manchester) Guardian''. ''Newsweek'' juxtaposed a photograph of de Man with another of Nazis on the march. ''Le Soir'' described him as 'an academic [[Kurt Waldheim#Election and Waldheim Affair|Waldheim]]."<ref name=Atlas1988/>

De Man's disciples tried to portray the attacks on de Man as a cover for his critics' dislike of deconstruction, alleging that the attacks were a ruse that used de Man's youthful errors as evidence of what they considered the decadence at the heart of the Continental thought behind de Man and his theories. The controversies quickly spread from the pages of scholarly journals{{sfn|Derrida|1988|pp=597–598}} to the broader media. ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' and the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' exposed the sensational details of de Man's personal life, particularly the circumstances of his marriage and his difficult relationships with his children.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yale Scholar Wrote for Pro-Nazi Newspaper|work=The New York Times|date=December 1, 1987|pages=B1, B6}}</ref>

In the most controversial and explicitly anti-semitic essay from this wartime journalism, titled "Jews in Contemporary Literature" (1941), de Man described how "[v]ulgar anti-semitism willingly takes pleasure in considering post-war cultural phenomenon (after the war of 14–18) as degenerate and decadent because they are [enjewished]."<ref name=deMan127-129>Paul de Man. "The Jews in Contemporary Literature." Originally published in ''Le Soir'' (March 4, 1941), Martin McQuillan, translator, in Martin McQuillan, ''Paul de Man. USA'' (Routledge. 2001), pp. 127–29.</ref> He notes that

<blockquote>Literature does not escape this lapidary judgement: it is sufficient to discover a few Jewish writers under Latinized pseudonyms for all contemporary production to be considered polluted and evil. This conception entails rather dangerous consequences ... it would be a rather unflattering appreciation of western writers to reduce them to being mere imitators of a Jewish culture which is foreign to them.<ref name=deMan127-129/></blockquote>

The article claimed that contemporary literature had not broken from tradition as a result of the First World War and that

<blockquote>the Jews cannot claim to have been its creators, nor even to have exercised a preponderant influence over its development. On any closer examination, this influence appears to have extraordinarily little importance since one might have expected that, given the specific characteristics of the Jewish Spirit, the later would have played a more brilliant role in this artistic production.<ref name=deMan127-129/></blockquote>

The article concluded that "our civilization...[b]y keeping, in spite of Semitic interference in all aspects of European life, an intact originality and character...has shown that its basic character is healthy." It concluded that "the creation of a Jewish colony isolated from Europe" as "a solution to the [[Jewish Question|Jewish problem]]" would not entail any "deplorable consequences" for "the literary life of the west."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Les Juifs dans la littérature actuelle|author=Paul de Man|date=March 4, 1941|magazine=Le Soir|page=45|language=fr}}</ref> This is the only known article in which de Man pronounced such views so openly, though two or three other articles also accept without demurral the disenfranchisement and ostracization of Jews, as some contributors to ''Responses'' have noted.

De Man's colleagues, students, and contemporaries tried to respond to his early writings and his subsequent silence about them in the volume ''Responses: On Paul de Man's Wartime Journalism''<ref>{{cite book |title=Responses: On Paul de Man's Wartime Journalism: Werner Hamacher, Neil H. Hertz, Thomas Keenan: 9780803272439: Amazon.com: Books |isbn=080327243X |last1=Hamacher |first1=Werner |last2=Hertz |first2=Neil |last3=Keenan |first3=Thomas |date=January 1989 |publisher=U of Nebraska Press }}</ref> (edited by Werner Hamacher, Neil Hertz, and Thomas Keenan; Nebraska, 1989). His longtime friend, Jacques Derrida, who was Jewish, published a long piece responding to de Man's critics, declaring:

<blockquote>To judge, to condemn the work or the man on the basis of what was a brief episode, to call for closing, that is to say, at least figuratively, for censuring or burning his books is to reproduce the exterminating gesture which one accuses de Man of not having armed himself against sooner with the necessary vigilance. It is not even to draw a lesson that he, de Man, learned to draw from the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Derrida|1988|p=651}}; see also the "Critical Responses" in ''Critical Inquiry'' 15 (Summer 1989, 765–811) and Derrida's reply, "Biodegradables: Seven Diary Fragments", 812–873.</ref></blockquote>

Some readers objected to what they considered as Derrida's effort to relate criticism of de Man to the greater tragedy of extermination of the Jews.<ref>See, for example, {{cite journal|author=Jon Wiener|title=The Responsibilities of Friendship: Jacques Derrida on Paul de Man's Collaboration|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=15|issue=4|date=Summer 1989|pages=797–803|doi=10.1086/448520|s2cid=145367297}}</ref>

[[Fredric Jameson]] lengthily defended de Man in ''[[Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism]]'' (1991), observing about de Man's critics that "it does not seem to me that North American intellectuals have generally had the kind of experience of history that would qualify them to judge the actions and choices of people under [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|military occupation]]."<ref name="Jameson 257">Fredric Jameson, 1991, ''Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. pp.&nbsp;256–58</ref> According to Jameson, the efforts to implicate de Man in the Holocaust hinged on a fundamental misunderstanding of Nazi anti-Semitism:

<blockquote>The exclusive emphasis on anti-Semitism ignores and politically neutralizes its other constitutive feature in the Nazi period: namely, anticommunism. [The] very possibility of the Judeocide was absolutely at one with and inseparable from the anticommunist and radical right-wing mission of National Socialism.... But put this way, it seems at once clear that DeMan was neither an anticommunist nor a right-winger: had he taken such positions in his student days..., they would have been public knowledge.<ref name = "Jameson 257" /></blockquote>

Turning to the content and ideology of de Man's wartime journalism, Jameson contended that it was "devoid of any personal originality or distinctiveness", simply rehearsing [[corporatist]] commonplaces found in a broad range of European political movements. From this, Jameson concluded that none of the wartime articles "had any relevance to Paul De Man, for whom the thing dramatically called 'collaboration' was simply a job, in a Europe henceforth and for the foreseeable future [[Greater Germanic Reich|united and German]], and who as long as I knew him personally was simply a good [[Liberalism|liberal]]."<ref name = "Jameson 257" />

Since the late 1980s, some of de Man's followers, many of them Jewish, have pointed out that de Man at no time in his life displayed personal animus against Jews. Shoshana Felman, recounted that

<blockquote>about a year after the journalistic publication of his compromising statement, he and his wife sheltered for several days in their apartment the Jewish pianist Esther Sluszny and her husband, who were then illegal citizens in hiding from the Nazis. During this same period, de Man was meeting regularly with Georges Goriely, a member of the Belgian Resistance. According to Goriely's own testimony, he never for one minute feared denunciation of his underground activities by Paul de Man.<ref>Shoshana Felman, "Paul de Man's Silence", ''Critical Inquiry'' 15: 4 (Summer, 1989): 704–744</ref></blockquote>

Jameson proposed that de Man's apparent anti-Semitism was suffused with [[irony]] and, properly interpreted, served as a [[Philo-Semitism|philosemitic]] parody and rebuke of conventional anti-Semitic tropes.{{efn|Jameson renders the basic message of de Man's wartime writings as follows: "you garden-variety anti-Semites ... in fact do your own cause a disservice. You have not understood that if 'Jewish literature' is as dangerous and virulent as you claim it is, it follows that Aryan literature does not amount to much ... You would therefore under these circumstances be better advised to stop talking about the Jews altogether and to cultivate your own garden."<ref name = "Jameson 257" />}}

But, his disciples and defenders have failed to agree about the nature of de Man's silence about his wartime activities. His critics, on the other hand, point out that throughout his life de Man was not only passively silent, but also engaged in an active coverup through lies and misdirections about his past.

The question of de Man's personal history has continued to fascinate scholars, as evidenced by Evelyn Barish's 2014 biography ''The Double Life of Paul de Man''.{{sfn|Barish|2014}} In an advance review published in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', Christine Smallwood concludes that de Man, as portrayed by Barish, was "a slippery Mr. [[Tom Ripley|Ripley]], a confidence man, and a hustler who embezzled, lied, forged, and arreared his way to intellectual acclaim."<ref name=Smallwood2014/> In response to these claims, [[Peter Brooks (writer)|Peter Brooks]], who succeeded to de Man's post as Sterling Professor at Yale, stated that some of Barish's accusations were overblown, identifying several errors in her footnotes: "One could do a review of Barish's footnotes that would cast many doubts on her scholarship".<ref name=Brooks2014/> For example, he cites the footnote Barish provides to support her claim that in 1942 de Man planned to launch a Nazi literary magazine: "I shared this information, and it has since been previously published in Belgian sources not now available to me", noting that this sort of thing "does not pass any sort of muster." Harvard professor [[Louis Menand]], on the other hand, in his review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', finds Barish's biography important and credible, notwithstanding the presence of occasional errors and exaggerations. Menand writes "[h]er book is a brief for the prosecution. But it is not a hatchet job, and she has an amazing tale to tell. In her account, all guns are smoking. There are enough to stock a miniseries."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2014/03/24/140324crat_atlarge_menand?currentPage=all|author=Louis Menand|title=The de Man Case: Does a Critic's Past Explain His Criticism?|magazine=The New Yorker|date=March 24, 2014}}</ref>
