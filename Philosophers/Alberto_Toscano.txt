'''Alberto Toscano''' (born 1 January 1977) is an Italian [[cultural critic]], [[social theorist]], [[philosopher]], and [[translation|translator]]. He has translated the work of [[Alain Badiou]], including Badiou's ''The Century'' and ''Logics of Worlds''. He served as both editor and translator of Badiou's ''Theoretical Writings'' and ''On Beckett''.

==Work== 
Toscano was born in Moscow, [[Soviet Union|USSR]], on 1 January 1977. He studied philosophy at the Eugene Lang College, [[The New School for Social Research|New School for Social Research]], where he received his BA Liberal Arts in 1997. He received his MA in [[Continental philosophy|Continental Philosophy]] at the [[University College Dublin]] in 1999. He then went on to pursue a PhD in philosophy at the [[University of Warwick]], which he completed in 2003.<ref name=Golds/> 

Toscano works across [[critical social theory]] and [[philosophy]]. His current research is divided into three main strands:<ref name=Golds>Goldsmiths, University of London, [https://www.gold.ac.uk/sociology/staff/toscano/ Professor Alberto Toscano]</ref> 
*a theoretical and historical inquiry into the politics of [[authoritarianism]] and their links to the [[Racial discrimination|racial]], [[geopolitical]] and [[Gender|gendered]] [[Crisis of capitalism|crises of capital]], set out in his recent book ''Late Fascism: Race, Capitalism and the Politics of Crisis''; 
*the study of [[tragedy]] as a framework through which to understand collective politics and its discontents, from [[Decolonization|decolonisation]] to [[climate action]]; 
* the development of ‘real abstraction’ as a [[heuristic]] for the analysis [[contemporary capitalism]], notably in its nexus with processes of [[racialization]], [[automation]] and [[digital culture|digitalization]]. 

His work has been described both as an investigation of the persistence of the idea of [[communism]] in contemporary thought and a genealogical inquiry into the concept of [[fanaticism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://v2.nl/archive/people/alberto-toscano|title=V2_ Lab for the Unstable Media|website=V2_ Lab for the Unstable Media}}</ref> He is the author of ''The Theatre of Production'' (2006), and his book ''Fanaticism: On the Uses of an Idea'' was published in 2010. Toscano has published on contemporary philosophy, politics and social theory. In an  article on the [[Tarnac 9]] case, written for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in December 2009,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/28/human-rights-tarnac-nine|title=Criminalising dissent|first=Alberto|last=Toscano|date=January 28, 2009|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Toscano argues that society is losing its ability to distinguish between vandalism and terrorism.

A reader in [[sociology]] at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], Toscano is a member of the editorial board of the journal ''[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism: Research in Critical Marxist Theory]]''. According to [[Alex Callinicos]] this journal "has been one of the main drivers of the academic revival of [[Marxism]]" <ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/jul/01/marxism-2010-global-financial-system|title= Marxism 2010: fixing a broken system|author= Alex Callinicos |date=July 1, 2010 |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate= July 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100704222519/http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2010/jul/01/marxism-2010-global-financial-system| archivedate= 4 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> since the mid-1990s.
