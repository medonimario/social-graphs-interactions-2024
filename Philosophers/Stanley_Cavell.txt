'''Stanley Louis<!--see VIAF data--> Cavell''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|v|ɛ|l}}; September 1, 1926 – June 19, 2018) was an [[American philosopher]]. He was the [[Cabot family|Walter M. Cabot]] Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value at [[Harvard University]].  He worked in the fields of [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], and [[ordinary language philosophy]].  As an interpreter, he produced influential works on [[Wittgenstein]], [[J.L. Austin|Austin]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], [[Thoreau]], and [[Heidegger]].  His work is characterized by its conversational tone and frequent literary references.

He entered graduate school in philosophy at [[UCLA]], and then transferred to [[Harvard University]].<ref>Little Did I Know, 247 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref>  As a student there he came under the influence of [[J.

In the summer of 1964, Cavell joined a group of graduate students, who taught at [[Tougaloo College]], a [[historically black]] Protestant college in Mississippi, as part of what became known as the [[Freedom Summer]].<ref>Little Did I Know, 373 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref> He and Cathleen (Cohen) Cavell were married in 1967. In April 1969, during the student protests (chiefly arising from the [[Vietnam War]]), Cavell, helped by his colleague [[John Rawls]], worked with a group of African-American students to draft language for a faculty vote to establish Harvard's Department of African and African-American Studies.<ref>Little Did I Know, 508–512 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref>

==Philosophy==
Although trained in the Anglo-American [[analytical philosophy|analytic tradition]], Cavell frequently interacted with the [[continental philosophy|continental tradition]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Wheatley|first=Catherine|title=Stanley Cavell and Film: Scepticism and Self-Reliance at the Cinema|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2019|isbn=978-1-7883-1025-3|location=London|pages=19|language=en}}</ref> He includes [[film]] and [[literary criticism|literary]] study in philosophical inquiry.<ref name=":0" /> Cavell wrote extensively on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J.

Although their exchange was congenial, Cavell denied the full extent to which [[Deconstruction (philosophical theory)|deconstruction]] could undermine the possibility of meaning, instead taking an explicitly [[Ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language]] approach to language and skepticism.<ref>Gordon C. F. Bearn. “Sounding Serious: Cavell and Derrida.” Representations, no. 63, University of California Press, 1998, pp. 65–92, https://doi.org/10.2307/2902918.</ref> He writes about Wittgenstein in a fashion known as the [[New Wittgenstein]], which according to [[Alice Crary]] interprets Wittgenstein as putting forward a positive view of philosophy as a therapeutic form.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Peters|first=Michael A.|title=Wittgenstein, Anti-foundationalism, Technoscience and Philosophy of Education: An Educational Philosophy and Theory Reader Volume VIII|publisher=Routledge|year=2020|isbn=978-1-000-02800-3|location=Oxon|language=en}}</ref> Cavell's work incorporates autobiographical elements concerning how his movement between and within these thinkers' ideas influenced his views in the arts and humanities, beyond the technical study of philosophy.

Cavell established his distinct philosophical identity with ''Must We Mean What We Say?'' (1969), a collection of essays that addresses topics such as language use, metaphor, skepticism, tragedy, and literary interpretation from the point of view of [[ordinary language philosophy]], of which he is a practitioner and ardent defender. One of the essays discusses [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s work on revelation and authority, ''[[The Book on Adler]]'', in an effort to help reintroduce the book to modern philosophical readers.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Journal of Religion |date=July 1977 |title=Some Remarks on Authority and Revelation in Kierkegaard |last=Jones |first=Joe R. |volume=57 |issue=3 |page=237 |doi=10.1086/486547 |jstor=1201641 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1201641}}</ref> In ''The World Viewed'' (1971) Cavell looks at photography, film, modernism in art and the nature of media, mentioning the influence of art critic [[Michael Fried]] on his work.

Cavell is well-known for ''The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality, and Tragedy'' (1979), which forms the centerpiece of his work and has its origins in his doctoral dissertation. In ''Pursuits of Happiness'' (1981), Cavell describes his experience of seven prominent Hollywood comedies: ''[[The Lady Eve]]'', ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', ''[[His Girl Friday]]'', ''[[Adam’s Rib]]'', and ''[[The Awful Truth]]''. Cavell argues that these films, from 1934–1949, form part of what he calls the genre of "[[remarriage|The Comedy of Remarriage]]," and finds in them great philosophical, moral, and political significance. Specifically, Cavell argues that these comedies show that "the achievement of happiness requires not the [...] satisfaction of our needs [...] but the examination and transformation of those needs."<ref>Cavell, ''Pursuits of Happiness'', 1981, pp. 4–5.</ref>  According to Cavell, the emphasis these movies place on remarriage draws attention to the fact that, within a relationship, happiness requires "growing up" together with one's partner.<ref>Cavell, ''Pursuits of Happiness'', 1981, p. 136.</ref>

In ''Cities of Words'' (2004) Cavell traces the history of [[moral perfectionism]], a mode of moral thinking spanning the history of Western philosophy and literature. Having used Emerson to outline the concept, the book suggests ways we might want to understand philosophy, literature, and film as preoccupied with features of perfectionism. In ''Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow'' (2005), a collection of essays, Cavell makes the case that J. L. Austin's concept of [[performative utterance]] requires the supplementary concept of ''passionate utterance'': "A performative utterance is an offer of participation in the order of law. And perhaps we can say: A passionate utterance is an invitation to improvisation in the disorders of desire."<ref>Cavell, ''Philosophy the Day after Tomorrow'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, & London: Harvard University Press, 2005), p. 19.</ref> The book also contains extended discussions of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jane Austen]], [[George Eliot]], [[Henry James]], and [[Fred Astaire]], as well as familiar Cavellian subjects such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Emerson, Thoreau, Wittgenstein, and Heidegger. Cavell's final book, ''Little Did I Know: Excerpts from Memory'' (2010), is an autobiography written in the form of a diary. In a series of consecutive, dated entries, he inquires about the origins of his philosophy by telling the story of his life.

A scholarly journal, ''Conversations: The Journal of Cavellian Studies'', engages with his philosophical work. It is edited by [[Sérgio Dias Branco]] and Amir Khan and published by the [[University of Ottawa]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=About the Journal {{!}} Conversations: The Journal of Cavellian Studies |url=https://uottawa.scholarsportal.info/ottawa/index.php/conversations/about |access-date=2024-10-10 |website=uottawa.scholarsportal.info}}</ref>
