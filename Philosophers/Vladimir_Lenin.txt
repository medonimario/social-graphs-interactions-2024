'''Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov'''{{efn|{{langx|ru|Владимир Ильич Ульянов}} {{IPA|ru|vlɐˈdʲimʲɪr ɨˈlʲjitɕ ʊˈlʲjanəf|}}.}} ({{OldStyleDateNY|22 April|10 April}} 1870{{snd}}21 January 1924), better known as '''Vladimir Lenin''',{{efn|English: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|n|ᵻ|n}};{{sfn|''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary''}} {{langx|ru|Ленин}} {{IPA|ru|ˈlʲenʲɪn|}}.}} was a Russian revolutionary, politician and political theorist who was the founder and first [[head of government]] of [[Soviet Russia]] from 1917 until [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|his death]] in 1924, and of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1922 until his death. The founder and leader of the [[Bolsheviks]], Lenin led the [[October Revolution]] which established the world's first [[socialist state]]. His government won the [[Russian Civil War]] and consolidated power in a [[one-party state]] under the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. Ideologically a [[Marxist]], his developments to the ideology are called [[Leninism]].

<!--Early life and revolutionary activity-->
Born into a middle-class family in [[Simbirsk]], Lenin embraced [[revolutionary socialist]] politics following [[Aleksandr Ulyanov|his brother]]'s 1887 execution. Expelled from [[Kazan Imperial University]] for participating in protests against the [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist government]], he devoted the following years to a law degree before relocating to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1893 and becoming a prominent Marxist activist. In 1897, Lenin was arrested for [[sedition]] and exiled to Siberia for three years. He then moved to Western Europe, where he became a key figure in the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. In the party's 1903 schism, he led his Bolshevik faction against [[Julius Martov]]'s [[Mensheviks]]. Lenin briefly returned to Russia during the failed [[Revolution of 1905]], and during the [[First World War]] campaigned for its transformation into a Europe-wide [[proletarian revolution]], which, as a Marxist, he believed would cause the end of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] and the rise of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 ousted Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and established a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], Lenin returned to Russia and played a leading role in the [[October Revolution]], in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the regime.

<!--October Revolution and Lenin's government-->
Lenin's government redistributed land to the peasantry, [[Soviet Decree|issued a number of legislative decrees]], nationalised banks and industry, withdrew from the war by signing the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with the [[Central Powers]], and promoted [[world revolution]] through the [[Communist International]]. It initially shared power with the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]] and allowed a multi-party [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]], but by 1918 centralised power in the new Communist Party. Opponents were suppressed in the [[Red Terror]], and tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps.  Responding to devastation, [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]], and popular uprisings, Lenin reversed his policy of [[war communism]] in 1921, and encouraged economic growth through the [[New Economic Policy]]. His administration defeated right and left-wing anti-Bolshevik armies in the Russian Civil War, after which several non-Russian nations that had broken away from the empire after 1917 were [[Treaty on the Creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|re-united in the new Soviet Union]] in 1922; others, notably Poland, gained independence. Lenin suffered three debilitating strokes in 1922 and 1923 before his death in 1924, with [[Joseph Stalin]] succeeding him as the pre-eminent figure in the Soviet government.

<!--Reception and legacy-->
Widely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive [[personality cult]] within the Soviet Union until [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|its dissolution]] in 1991. Under Stalin, he became an ideological figurehead of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and a prominent influence over the international [[communist movement]]. A controversial and highly divisive figure, Lenin is praised by his supporters for establishing a revolutionary government which took steps towards socialism, while his critics accuse him of establishing a dictatorship which oversaw [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|mass killings and political repression]].

==Early life==
{{Main|Early life of Vladimir Lenin}}

===Childhood: 1870–1887===

Lenin was born Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov in Streletskaya Ulitsa, Simbirsk, now [[Ulyanovsk]], on 22 April 1870, and [[Infant baptism|baptised]] six days later;{{sfn|Sebestyen|2017|p=33}} as a child, he was known as ''Volodya'' the common nickname variant of Vladimir.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=6|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=12|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=13}} He was the third of eight children, having two older siblings, [[Anna Ulyanova|Anna]] (born 1864) and [[Aleksandr Ulyanov|Alexander]] (born 1866). They were followed by three more children, [[Olga Ilyinichna Ulyanova|Olga]] (born 1871), [[Dmitri Ilyich Ulyanov|Dmitry]] (born 1874), and [[Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova|Maria]] (born 1878). Two later siblings died in infancy.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=6|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12, 14|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=25|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=19–20|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=4|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6pp=21, 22}} His father, [[Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov]], was a devout member of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and baptised his children into it, although his mother, [[Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova]] (née Blank), a [[Lutheran]] by upbringing, was largely indifferent to [[Christianity]], a view that influenced her children.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=3, 8|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=14–15|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=29}}

[[File:Dom ulyanovyh.jpg|thumb|left|Lenin's childhood home in [[Simbirsk]], pictured in 2009]]

Ilya Ulyanov was from a family of former [[Serfdom in Russia|serfs]]; Ilya's father's ethnicity remains unclear, with suggestions that he was of [[Russians|Russian]], [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordvin]], or [[Kalmyks|Kalmyk]] ancestry.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=1–2|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12–13|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=7|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=21–23|5a1=White|5y=2001|5pp=13–15|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=6}} Despite a lower-class background, he had risen to middle-class status, studying physics and mathematics at [[Kazan University]] before teaching at the [[Institute for Nobles|Penza Institute for the Nobility]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=1–2|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12–13|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=21–23|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=13–15|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=6}} In mid-1863, Ilya married Maria,{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=5|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=13|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=23}} the well-educated daughter of a wealthy [[Swedish diaspora|Swedish]] [[Lutheran]] mother and a [[Russian Jewish]] father who had [[Apostasy in Judaism|converted to Christianity]] and worked as a physician.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=2–3|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=12|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=16–19, 23|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=15–18|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=5|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=20}} According to historian [[Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern|Petrovsky-Shtern]], it is likely that Lenin was unaware of his mother's half-Jewish ancestry, which was only discovered by Anna after his death.{{sfn|Petrovsky-Shtern|2010|pp=66–67}} Soon after their wedding, Ilya obtained a job in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], rising to become Director of Primary Schools in the [[Simbirsk]] district six years later. Five years after that, he was promoted to Director of Public Schools for the province, overseeing the foundation of over 450 schools as a part of the government's plans for modernisation. In January 1882, his dedication to education earned him the [[Order of Saint Vladimir]], which bestowed on him the status of [[Russian nobility|hereditary nobleman]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=6|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=13–14, 18|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=25, 27|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=18–19|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5pp=4, 8|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=21|7a1=Yakovlev|7y=1988|7p=112}}

[[File:Vladimir Lenin 3 years old.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lenin (''left'') at the age of three with his sister, [[Olga Ilyinichna Ulyanova|Olga]]]]
Both of Lenin's parents were monarchists and [[liberal conservatives]], being committed to the [[emancipation reform of 1861]] introduced by the reformist Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]; they avoided political radicals and there is no evidence that the police ever put them under surveillance for subversive thought.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=8|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=27|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=19}} Every summer they holidayed at a rural manor in [[Kokushkino]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=18|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=26|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=20|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=7|5a1=Petrovsky-Shtern|5y=2010|5p=64}} Among his siblings, Lenin was closest to his sister [[Olga Ilyinichna Ulyanova|Olga]], whom he often bossed around; he had an extremely competitive nature and could be destructive, but usually admitted his misbehaviour.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=7|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=16|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=32–36}} A keen sportsman, he spent much of his free time outdoors or playing chess, and excelled at school, the disciplinarian and conservative Simbirsk Classical Gymnasium.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=7|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=17|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=36–46|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=20|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=9}}

In January 1886, when Lenin was 15, his father died of a brain haemorrhage.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=6, 9|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=19|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=48–49|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=10}} Subsequently, his behaviour became erratic and confrontational, and he renounced his belief in God.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=9|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=50–51, 64|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3p=16|4a1=Petrovsky-Shtern|4y=2010|4p=69}} At the time, Lenin's elder brother Alexander, whom he affectionately knew as Sasha, was studying at [[Saint Petersburg University]]. Involved in political agitation against the absolute monarchy of the [[reactionary]] Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], Alexander studied the writings of banned leftists and organised anti-government protests. He joined a revolutionary cell bent on assassinating the Tsar and was selected to construct a bomb. Before the attack could take place, the conspirators were arrested and tried, and Alexander was executed by hanging in May 1887.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=10–17|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=20, 22–24|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=52–58|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=21–28|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=10|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6pp=23–25}} Despite the emotional trauma of his father's and brother's deaths, Lenin continued studying, graduated from school at the top of his class with a gold medal for exceptional performance, and decided to study law at Kazan University.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=25|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=61|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=29|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=16|6a1=Theen|6y=2004|6p=33}}

===University and political radicalisation: 1887–1893===
[[File:Lenin-circa-1887.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Lenin {{Circa|1887}}]]

Upon entering [[Kazan University]] in August 1887, Lenin moved into a nearby flat.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=26|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=61–63}} There, he joined a {{tlit|ru|[[zemlyachestvo]]}}, a form of university society that represented the men of a particular region.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=26–27|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=64–68, 70|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=29}} This group elected him as its representative to the university's ''zemlyachestvo'' council, and he took part in a December demonstration against government restrictions that banned student societies. The police arrested Lenin and accused him of being a ringleader in the demonstration; he was expelled from the university, and the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Empire|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] exiled him to his family's Kokushkino estate.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=27|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=68–69|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=29|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=15|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=32}} There, he read voraciously, becoming enamoured with [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]]'s 1863 pro-revolutionary novel ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]''{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=28|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=30|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=12|5a1=Lih|5y=2011|5pp=32–33}}

Lenin's mother was concerned by her son's radicalisation, and was instrumental in convincing the Interior Ministry to allow him to return to the city of [[Kazan]], but not the university.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=310|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=71}} On his return, he joined [[Nikolai Fedoseev]]'s revolutionary circle, through which he discovered [[Karl Marx]]'s 1867 book ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]]''. This sparked his interest in [[Marxism]], a socio-political theory that argued that society developed in stages, that this development resulted from [[class struggle]], and that [[capitalist society]] would ultimately give way to [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]] and then [[communist society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=19|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=32–33|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=72|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=30–31|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=18|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=33}} Wary of his political views, Lenin's mother bought a country estate in Alakaevka village, [[Samara Oblast]], in the hope that her son would turn his attention to agriculture. He had little interest in farm management, and his mother soon sold the land, keeping the house as a summer home.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=33|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=74–76|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=31|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=17}}

[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Lenin was influenced by the works of [[Karl Marx]].]]

In September 1889, the Ulyanov family moved to the city of [[Samara]], where Lenin joined [[Alexei Sklyarenko]]'s socialist discussion circle.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=34|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=78|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=31}} There, Lenin fully embraced Marxism and produced a Russian language translation of Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]]'s 1848 political pamphlet, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=34|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=77|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3p=18}} He began to read the works of the Russian Marxist [[Georgi Plekhanov]], agreeing with Plekhanov's argument that Russia was moving from [[feudalism]] to capitalism and so socialism would be implemented by the [[proletariat]], or urban working class, rather than the peasantry.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=34, 36–37|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=55–55, 80, 88–89|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=31|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4pp=37–38|5a1=Lih|5y=2011|5pp=34–35}} This Marxist perspective contrasted with the view of the agrarian-socialist [[Narodnik]] movement, which held that the peasantry could establish socialism in Russia by forming peasant communes, thereby bypassing capitalism. This Narodnik view developed in the 1860s with the [[Narodnaya Volya|People's Freedom Party]] and was then dominant within the Russian revolutionary movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=23–25, 26|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=55|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=11, 24}} Lenin rejected the premise of the [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian-socialist]] argument but was influenced by agrarian-socialists like [[Pyotr Tkachev]] and [[Sergei Nechaev]] and befriended several Narodniks.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=79, 98}}

In May 1890, Maria, who retained societal influence as the widow of a nobleman, persuaded the authorities to allow Lenin to take his exams [[External degree|externally]] at the University of St Petersburg, where he obtained the equivalent of a first-class degree with honours. The graduation celebrations were marred when his sister Olga died of [[typhoid]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=34–36|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=82–86|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=31|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4pp=18, 19|5a1=Lih|5y=2011|5p=40}} Lenin remained in Samara for several years, working first as a legal assistant for a regional court and then for a local lawyer.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=21|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=36|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=86|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=31|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=18|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=40}} He devoted much time to radical politics, remaining active in Sklyarenko's group and formulating ideas about how Marxism applied to Russia. Inspired by Plekhanov's work, Lenin collected data on Russian society, using it to support a Marxist interpretation of societal development and counter the claims of the Narodniks.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=21|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=36, 37}} He wrote a paper on peasant economics; it was rejected by the liberal journal ''[[Russian Thought]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=21|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=38|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=93–94}}

Hoping to cement connections between his Social-Democrats and [[Emancipation of Labour]], a group of Russian Marxists based in [[Switzerland]], Lenin visited the country to meet group members Plekhanov and [[Pavel Axelrod]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=30|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2p=354|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3pp=44–46|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=103|5a1=White|5y=2001|5p=37|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=26|7a1=Lih|7y=2011|7p=55}} He proceeded to Paris to meet Marx's son-in-law [[Paul Lafargue]] and to research the [[Paris Commune of 1871]], which he considered an early prototype for a proletarian government.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=46|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=103|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=37|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=26}} Financed by his mother, he stayed in a Swiss health spa before travelling to [[Berlin]], where he studied for six weeks at the [[Berlin State Library|Staatsbibliothek]] and met the Marxist [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=30|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=46|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=103|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=37|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=26}} Returning to Russia with a stash of illegal revolutionary publications, he travelled to various cities distributing literature to striking workers.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=47–48|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2p=26}} While involved in producing a news sheet, ''Rabochee delo'' (''Workers' Cause''), he was among 40 activists arrested in St. Petersburg and charged with sedition.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=31|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2p=355|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=48|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=38|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=26}}

Refused legal representation or bail, Lenin denied all charges against him but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=31|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=48–51|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=107–108|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=31|5a1=Lih|5y=2011|5p=61}} He spent this time theorising and writing. In this work he noted that the rise of [[industrial capitalism]] in Russia had caused large numbers of peasants to move to the cities, where they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin argued that this Russian proletariat would develop [[class consciousness]], which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow [[Tsarism]], the [[aristocracy]], and the [[bourgeoisie]] and to establish a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] that would move toward socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=31|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=48–51|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=107–108}}

In February 1897, Lenin was sentenced without trial to three years' exile in eastern Siberia. He was granted a few days in Saint Petersburg to put his affairs in order and used this time to meet with the Social-Democrats, who had renamed themselves the [[League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=31|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=52–55|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=109–110|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=38, 45, 47|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=31}} His journey to eastern Siberia took 11 weeks, for much of which he was accompanied by his mother and sisters. Deemed only a minor threat to the government, he was exiled to [[Shushenskoye]], [[Minusinsky District]], where he was kept under police surveillance; he was nevertheless able to correspond with other revolutionaries, many of whom visited him, and permitted to go on trips to swim in the [[Yenisei River]] and to hunt duck and [[snipe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=31–32|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=53, 55–56|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=110–113|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=40|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5pp=30, 31}}

In May 1898, Nadya joined him in exile, having been arrested in August 1896 for organising a strike. She was initially posted to [[Ufa]], but persuaded the authorities to move her to Shushenskoye, where she and Lenin married on 10 July 1898.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=33|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2p=356|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=114, 140|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=40|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=30|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=63}} Settling into a family life with Nadya's mother Elizaveta Vasilyevna, in Shushenskoye the couple translated English socialist literature into Russian.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=33–34|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=53, 55–56|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=117|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=33}} There, Lenin wrote ''A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats'' to criticise German Marxist [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]] like [[Eduard Bernstein]] who advocated a peaceful, electoral path to socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=61–63|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=124|3a1=Rappaport|3y=2010|3p=31}} He also finished ''[[The Development of Capitalism in Russia]]'' (1899), his longest book to date, which criticised the agrarian-socialists and promoted a Marxist analysis of Russian economic development. Published under the pseudonym of Vladimir Ilin, upon publication it received predominantly poor reviews.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=57–58|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=121–124, 137|3a1=White|3y=2001|3pp=40–45|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4pp=34, 39|5a1=Lih|5y=2011|5pp=62–63}}

In January 1905, the [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]] massacre of protesters in St. Petersburg sparked a spate of civil unrest in the [[Russian Empire]] known as the [[Revolution of 1905]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=44|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=86–88|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=167|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=75|5a1=Rappaport|5y=2010|5pp=117–120|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=87}} Lenin urged Bolsheviks to take a greater role in the events, encouraging violent insurrection.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=44–45|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=362–363|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3pp=88–89}} In doing so, he adopted SR slogans regarding "armed insurrection", "mass terror", and "the expropriation of gentry land", resulting in Menshevik accusations that he had deviated from orthodox Marxism.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=170–171}} In turn, he insisted that the Bolsheviks split completely with the Mensheviks; many Bolsheviks refused, and both groups attended the [[Third RSDLP Congress]], held in London in April 1905.{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1990|1pp=363–364|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=89–90|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=168–170|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=78|5a1=Rappaport|5y=2010|5p=124}} Lenin presented many of his ideas in the pamphlet ''[[Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic Revolution]]'', published in August 1905. Here, he predicted that Russia's liberal bourgeoisie would be sated by a transition to [[constitutional monarchy]] and thus betray the revolution; instead, he argued that the proletariat would have to build an alliance with the peasantry to overthrow the Tsarist regime and establish the "provisional revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry".{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=60|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2p=367|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3pp=90–91|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=179|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=79|6a1=Rappaport|6y=2010|6p=131}}

In response to the revolution of 1905, which had failed to overthrow the government, Tsar [[Nicholas II]] accepted a series of liberal reforms in his [[October Manifesto]]. In this climate, Lenin felt it safe to return to Saint Petersburg.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=51|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=94|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=175–176|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=81|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5pp=77, 81|6a1=Rappaport|6y=2010|6pp=132, 134–135}} Joining the editorial board of ''Novaya Zhizn'' (''New Life''), a radical legal newspaper run by [[Maria Fyodorovna Andreyeva|Maria Andreyeva]], he used it to discuss issues facing the RSDLP.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=94–95|2a1=White|2y=2001|2pp=73–74|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=81–82|4a1=Rappaport|4y=2010|4p=138}} He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for a successful revolution.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=96–97|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=176–178}} Recognising that membership fees and donations from a few wealthy sympathisers were insufficient to finance the Bolsheviks' activities, Lenin endorsed the idea of robbing post offices, railway stations, trains, and banks. Under the lead of [[Leonid Krasin]], a group of Bolsheviks began carrying out such criminal actions, the best-known taking place in June 1907, when a group of Bolsheviks acting under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]] committed [[1907 Tiflis bank robbery|an armed robbery of the State Bank]] in [[Tiflis]], Georgia.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=70–71|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=369–370|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=104}}

In May 1908, Lenin lived briefly in London, where he used the [[British Museum Reading Room]] to write ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]]'', an attack on what he described as the "bourgeois-reactionary falsehood" of Bogdanov's relativism.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=64–67|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=110|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=192–193|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=84, 87–88|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=90}} Lenin's factionalism began to alienate increasing numbers of Bolsheviks, including his former close supporters [[Alexei Rykov]] and [[Lev Kamenev]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=69|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=111|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=195}} The Okhrana exploited his factionalist attitude by sending a spy, [[Roman Malinovsky]], to act as a vocal Lenin supporter within the party.

In August 1910, Lenin attended the [[International Socialist Congress, Copenhagen 1910|8th Congress]] of the [[Second International]], an international meeting of socialists, in [[Copenhagen]] as the RSDLP's representative, following this with a holiday in Stockholm with his mother.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=70|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=114–116}} With his wife and sisters, he then moved to France, settling first in [[Bombon, Seine-et-Marne|Bombon]] and then Paris.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=68–69|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=112|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=195–196}} Here, he became a close friend to the French Bolshevik [[Inessa Armand]]; some biographers suggest that they had an extra-marital affair from 1910 to 1912.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=75–80|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=112|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3p=384|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=197–199|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=103}} Meanwhile, at a Paris meeting in June 1911, the RSDLP Central Committee decided to move their focus of operations back to Russia, ordering the closure of the Bolshevik Centre and its newspaper, ''Proletari''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=115|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=196|3a1=White|3y=2001|3pp=93–94}} Seeking to rebuild his influence in the party, Lenin arranged for [[Prague Party Conference|a party conference]] to be held in [[Prague]] in January 1912, and although 16 of the 18 attendants were Bolsheviks, he was heavily criticised for his factionalist tendencies and failed to boost his status within the party.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=71–72|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=116–117|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=204–206|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=96–97|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=95}}

In September 1917, Lenin published ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'', which argued that [[imperialism]] was a product of [[monopoly capitalism]], as capitalists sought to increase their profits by extending into new territories where wages were lower and raw materials cheaper. He believed that competition and conflict would increase and that war between the imperialist powers would continue until they were overthrown by proletariat revolution and socialism established.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=95–100, 107|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=132–134|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=245–246|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=118–121|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5pp=116–126}} He spent much of this time reading the works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], and [[Aristotle]], all of whom had been key influences on Marx.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=241–242}} This changed Lenin's interpretation of Marxism; whereas he once believed that policies could be developed based on predetermined scientific principles, he concluded that the only test of whether a policy was correct was its practice.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=243}} He still perceived himself as an orthodox Marxist, but he began to diverge from some of Marx's predictions about societal development; whereas Marx had believed that a "bourgeoisie-democratic revolution" of the middle classes had to take place before a "socialist revolution" of the proletariat, Lenin believed that in Russia the proletariat could overthrow the Tsarist regime without an intermediate revolution.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=238–239}}

===February Revolution and the July Days: 1917===
[[File:Lenin Sealed Train Map-en.svg|thumb|Lenin's travel route from Zurich to Saint&nbsp;Petersburg in April 1917, including the ride in a sealed train through German territory]]

In February 1917, the [[February Revolution]] broke out in Saint Petersburg, renamed [[Petrograd]] at the beginning of the First World War, as industrial workers went on strike over food shortages and deteriorating factory conditions. The unrest spread to other parts of Russia, and fearing that he would be violently overthrown, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated. The State Duma took over control of the country, establishing the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and converting the Empire into a new [[Russian Republic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=136–138|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=253}} When Lenin learned of this from his base in Switzerland, he celebrated with other dissidents.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=254–255}} He decided to return to Russia to take charge of the Bolsheviks but found that most passages into the country were blocked due to the ongoing conflict. He organised a plan with other dissidents to negotiate a passage for them through Germany, with which Russia was then at war. Recognising that these dissidents could cause problems for their Russian enemies, the German government agreed to permit 32 Russian citizens to travel by train through their territory, among them Lenin and his wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=109–110|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=139|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3pp=386, 389–391|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=255–256|5a1=White|5y=2001|5pp=127–128}} For political reasons, Lenin and the Germans agreed to a [[Disinformation|cover story]] that Lenin had travelled by [[sealed train]] carriage through German territory, but in fact the train was not truly sealed, and the passengers were allowed to disembark to, for example, spend the night in Frankfurt.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Ted Widmer |date=20 April 2017 |title=Lenin and the Russian Spark |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/lenin-and-the-russian-spark |access-date=26 November 2019 |magazine=The New Yorker}}</ref> The group travelled by train from Zürich to [[Sassnitz]], proceeding by ferry to [[Trelleborg]], Sweden, and from there to the [[Haparanda]]–[[Tornio]] border crossing and then to [[Helsinki]] before taking the final train to Petrograd.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=110–113|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=140–144|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3pp=391–392|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=257–260}}

Considering the government to be just as imperialist as the Tsarist regime, he advocated immediate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary, rule by [[Soviet (council)|soviet]]s, the nationalisation of industry and banks, and the state expropriation of land, all with the intention of establishing a proletariat government and pushing toward a socialist society. By contrast, the Mensheviks believed that Russia was insufficiently developed to transition to socialism and accused Lenin of trying to plunge the new Republic into civil war.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1pp=266–268, 279|2a1=White|2y=2001|2pp=134–136|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=147, 148}} Over the coming months Lenin campaigned for his policies, attending the meetings of the Bolshevik Central Committee, prolifically writing for the Bolshevik newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'', and giving public speeches in Petrograd aimed at converting workers, soldiers, sailors, and peasants to his cause.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1pp=267, 271–272|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2pp=152, 154}}

===October Revolution: 1917===

[[File:Brodskiy's Lenin.jpg|thumb|Painting of Lenin in front of the [[Smolny Institute]] by [[Isaak Brodsky]]]]

In August 1917, while Lenin was in Finland, General [[Lavr Kornilov]], the commander-in-chief of the Russian Army, sent troops to Petrograd in what appeared to be a military coup attempt against the Provisional Government. Premier [[Alexander Kerensky]] turned to the Petrograd Soviet, including its Bolshevik members, for help, allowing the revolutionaries to organise workers as [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] to defend the city. The coup petered out before it reached Petrograd, but the events had allowed the Bolsheviks to return to the open political arena.{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1990|1pp=439–465|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=150–151|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=299|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=143–144|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=173}} Fearing a counter-revolution from right-wing forces hostile to socialism, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries who dominated the Petrograd Soviet had been instrumental in pressuring the government to normalise relations with the Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Pipes|1990|p=465}} Both the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries had lost much popular support because of their affiliation with the Provisional Government and its unpopular continuation of the war.

By early 1918, many cities in western Russia faced famine as a result of chronic food shortages.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=236|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=558, 723|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=170|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=190}} Lenin blamed this on the [[kulaks]], or wealthier peasants, who allegedly hoarded the grain that they had produced to increase its financial value.

After the Armistice on the Western Front, Lenin believed that the breakout of the European revolution was imminent.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=387|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=173}} Seeking to promote this, Sovnarkom supported the establishment of [[Béla Kun]]'s [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|soviet government in Hungary]] in March 1919, followed by the [[Bavarian Council Republic|soviet government in Bavaria]] and [[Revolutions of 1917–23|various revolutionary socialist uprisings]] in other parts of Germany, including [[Spartacist uprising|that of the Spartacus League]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=333|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=388|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=173|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=395}} During Russia's Civil War, the Red Army was sent into the newly independent national republics on Russia's borders to aid Marxists there in establishing soviet systems of government.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=385–386}} In Europe, this resulted in the creation of new communist-led states in [[Commune of the Working People of Estonia|Estonia]], [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic|Latvia]], [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1918–19)|Lithuania]], [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia|Belarus]], and [[Ukrainian Soviet Republic|Ukraine]], all of which were nominally independent from Russia but in fact controlled from Moscow,{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=385–386}} while further east it led to the creation of communist governments in [[Mongolian People's Republic|Outer Mongolia]].{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=531, 536}} Various senior Bolsheviks wanted these absorbed into the Russian state; Lenin insisted that national sensibilities should be respected, but reassured his comrades that these nations' new Communist Party administrations were under the ''de facto'' authority of Sovnarkom.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=386}}

In late 1918, the [[British Labour Party]] called for the establishment of an international conference of socialist parties, the [[Labour and Socialist International]].{{sfn|Shub|1966|pp=389–390}} Lenin saw this as a revival of the Second International, which he had despised, and formulated his own rival international socialist conference to offset its impact.{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=390}} Organised with the aid of Zinoviev, [[Nikolai Bukharin]], Trotsky, [[Christian Rakovsky]], and [[Angelica Balabanoff]],{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=390}} the [[1st Congress of the Comintern|First Congress]] of this [[Communist International]] (Comintern) opened in Moscow in March 1919.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=525|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=390|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=174|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=390|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5p=386|6a1=White|6y=2001|6p=160|7a1=Read|7y=2005|7p=225}} It lacked global coverage; most of the delegates resided within the countries of the former Russian Empire, and most of the international delegates were not recognised by any socialist parties in their own nations.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=525|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2pp=390–391|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=174|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=386|5a1=White|5y=2001|5p=160}} Accordingly, the Bolsheviks dominated proceedings,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1p=387|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=160}} with Lenin subsequently authoring a series of regulations that meant that only socialist parties endorsing the Bolsheviks' views were permitted to join Comintern.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=525|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=398|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=225–226}} During the first conference, Lenin spoke to the delegates, lambasting the parliamentary path to socialism espoused by revisionist Marxists like Kautsky and repeating his calls for a violent overthrow of Europe's bourgeoisie governments.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=387}} While Zinoviev became Comintern's president, Lenin retained significant influence over it.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=395|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=391}}

The [[Second Congress of the Communist International]] opened in Petrograd's [[Smolny Institute]] in July 1920, representing the last time that Lenin visited a city other than Moscow.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=397|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=409}} There, he encouraged foreign delegates to emulate the Bolsheviks' seizure of power and abandoned his longstanding viewpoint that capitalism was a necessary stage in societal development, instead, encouraging those nations under colonial occupation to transform their pre-capitalist societies directly into socialist ones.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=409–410}} For this conference, he authored ''[["Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'', a short book articulating his criticism of elements within the British and German communist parties who refused to enter their nations' parliamentary systems and trade unions; instead, he urged them to do so to advance the revolutionary cause.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=415–420|2a1=White|2y=2001|2pp=161, 180–181}} The conference had to be suspended for several days due to the ongoing war with Poland,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=410}} and was relocated to Moscow, where it continued to hold sessions until August.{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=397}} Lenin's predicted world revolution did not materialise, as the Hungarian communist government was overthrown, and the German Marxist uprisings suppressed.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=341|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=396|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=174}}

===Famine and the New Economic Policy: 1920–1922===

Within the Communist Party, there was dissent from two factions, the [[Group of Democratic Centralism]] and the [[Workers' Opposition]], both of which accused the Russian state of being too centralised and bureaucratic.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=437–438|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=406|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=183|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=419|5a1=White|5y=2001|5pp=167–168}} The Workers' Opposition, which had connections to the official state trade unions, also expressed the concern that the government had lost the trust of the Russian working class.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=406|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=419|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=167}} They were angered by Trotsky's suggestion that the trade unions be eliminated. He deemed the unions to be superfluous in a "[[workers' state]]", but Lenin disagreed, believing it best to retain them; most Bolsheviks embraced Lenin's view in the 'trade union discussion'.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=436, 442|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=183–184|3a1=Sandle|3y=1999|3pp=104–105|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=422–423|5a1=White|5y=2001|5p=168|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=269}} To deal with the dissent, at the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Tenth Party Congress]] in February 1921, Lenin introduced a ban on factional activity within the party, under pain of expulsion.{{sfn|White|2001|p=170}}

Caused in part by a drought, the [[Russian famine of 1921]] was the most severe that the country had experienced since [[Russian famine of 1891–92|that of 1891]], resulting in around five million deaths.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=164}} The famine was exacerbated by government requisitioning, as well as the export of large quantities of Russian grain.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|pp=343, 347}} To aid the famine victims, the US government [[Russian Famine Relief Act|established]] the [[American Relief Administration]] to distribute food;{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=508|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=414|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=345|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=172}} Lenin was suspicious of this aid and had it closely monitored.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=346}} During the famine, [[Patriarch Tikhon]] called on Orthodox churches to sell unnecessary items to help feed the starving, an action endorsed by the government.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|pp=374–375}} In February 1922, Sovnarkom went further by calling on all valuables belonging to religious institutions to be [[1922 confiscation of Russian Orthodox Church property|forcibly appropriated and sold]].{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1pp=375–376|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2p=251|3a1=Ryan|3y=2012|3pp=176, 177}} Tikhon opposed the sale of items used within the [[Eucharist]] and many clergy resisted the appropriations, resulting in violence.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1p=376|2a1=Ryan|2y=2012|2p=178}}

In 1920 and 1921, local opposition to requisitioning resulted in anti-Bolshevik peasant uprisings breaking out across Russia, which were suppressed.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=467|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=406|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=343|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=425|5a1=White|5y=2001|5p=168|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=220|7a1=Ryan|7y=2012|7p=154}} Among the most significant was the [[Tambov Rebellion]], which was put down by the Red Army.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=459|2a1=Leggett|2y=1981|2pp=330–333|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=423–424|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=168|5a1=Ryan|5y=2012|5pp=154–155}} In February 1921, workers went on strike in Petrograd, resulting in the government proclaiming martial law in the city and sending in the Red Army to quell demonstrations.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1pp=406–407|2a1=Leggett|2y=1981|2pp=324–325|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=184|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=220|5a1=Ryan|5y=2012|5p=170}} In March, the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] began when sailors in [[Kronstadt]] revolted against the Bolshevik government, demanding that all socialists be allowed to publish freely, that independent trade unions be given freedom of assembly and that peasants be allowed free markets and not be subject to requisitioning.

Despite his illness, Lenin remained keenly interested in political developments. When the Socialist Revolutionary Party's leadership was found guilty of conspiring against the government in a trial held between June and August 1922, Lenin called for their execution; they were instead imprisoned indefinitely, only being executed during the [[Great Purge]] of Stalin's leadership.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=600–602|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2pp=428–430|3a1=Leggett|3y=1981|3p=318|4a1=Sandle|4y=1999|4p=164|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5pp=442–443|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=269|7a1=Ryan|7y=2012|7pp=174–175}} With Lenin's support, the government also succeeded in virtually eradicating Menshevism in Russia by expelling all Mensheviks from state institutions and enterprises in March 1923 and then imprisoning the party's membership in concentration camps.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1p=310|2a1=Leggett|2y=1981|2pp=320–322|3a1=Aves|3y=1996|3pp=175–178|4a1=Sandle|4y=1999|4p=164|5a1=Lee|5y=2003|5pp=103–104|6a1=Ryan|6y=2012|6p=172}} Lenin was concerned by the survival of the Tsarist bureaucratic system in Soviet Russia,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewin|1y=1969|1pp=8–9|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=176|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=270–272}} particularly during his final years.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=578|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=189}} Condemning bureaucratic attitudes, he suggested a total overhaul to deal with such problems,{{sfn|Rice|1990|pp=192–193}} in one letter complaining that "we are being sucked into a foul bureaucratic swamp".{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=578}}

During December 1922 and January 1923, Lenin dictated "[[Lenin's Testament]]", in which he discussed the personal qualities of his comrades, particularly Trotsky and Stalin.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=638–639|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=433|3a1=Lewin|3y=1969|3pp=73–75|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=417|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5p=464|6a1=White|6y=2001|6pp=173–174}} He recommended that Stalin be removed from the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party, deeming him ill-suited for the position.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=647|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2pp=434–435|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=192|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=273|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5p=469|6a1=White|6y=2001|6pp=174–175|7a1=Read|7y=2005|7pp=278–279}} Instead he recommended Trotsky for the job, describing him as "the most capable man in the present Central Committee"; he highlighted Trotsky's superior intellect but at the same time criticised his self-assurance and inclination toward excess administration.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=640|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2pp=434–435|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3pp=249, 418|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=465|5a1=White|5y=2001|5p=174}} During this period he dictated a criticism of the bureaucratic nature of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, calling for the recruitment of new, working-class staff as an antidote to this problem,{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=666–667, 669|2a1=Lewin|2y=1969|2pp=120–121|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=468|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=273}} while in another article he called for the state to combat illiteracy, promote punctuality and conscientiousness within the populace, and encourage peasants to join co‑operatives.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=650–654|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=470}}

In Lenin's absence, Stalin had begun consolidating his power both by appointing his supporters to prominent positions,{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1pp=426, 434|2a1=Lewin|2y=1969|2pp=34–35}} and by cultivating an image of himself as Lenin's closest intimate and deserving successor.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|pp=263–264}} In December 1922, Stalin took responsibility for Lenin's regimen, being tasked by the Politburo with controlling who had access to him.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewin|1y=1969|1p=70|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=191|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3pp=273, 416}} Lenin was increasingly critical of Stalin; while Lenin was insisting that the state should retain its monopoly on international trade during mid-1922, Stalin was leading other Bolsheviks in unsuccessfully opposing this.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=635|2a1=Lewin|2y=1969|2pp=35–40|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=451–452|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=173}} There were personal arguments between the two as well; Stalin had upset Krupskaya by shouting at her during a phone conversation, which in turn greatly angered Lenin, who sent Stalin a letter expressing his annoyance.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=637–638, 669|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2pp=435–436|3a1=Lewin|3y=1969|3pp=71, 85, 101|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4pp=273–274, 422–423|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5pp=463, 472–473|6a1=White|6y=2001|6pp=173, 176|7a1=Read|7y=2005|7p=279}}

The most significant political division between the two emerged during the [[Georgian Affair]]. Stalin had suggested that both the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|forcibly Sovietized]] Georgia and neighbouring countries like [[Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] and [[Red Army invasion of Armenia|Armenia]], which were all invaded and occupied by the Red Army, should be merged into the Russian state, despite the protestations of their local Soviet-installed governments.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=607–608|2a1=Lewin|2y=1969|2pp=43–49|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3pp=190–191|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=421|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5pp=452, 453–455|6a1=White|6y=2001|6pp=175–176}} Lenin saw this as an expression of Great Russian ethnic chauvinism by Stalin and his supporters, instead calling for these nation-states to join Russia as semi-independent parts of a greater union, which he suggested be called the Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=608|2a1=Lewin|2y=1969|2p=50|3a1=Leggett|3y=1981|3p=354|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=421|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5p=455|6a1=White|6y=2001|6p=175}} After some resistance to the proposal, Stalin eventually accepted it but, with Lenin's agreement, he changed the name of the newly proposed state to "[[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR)".{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=455, 456}} Lenin sent Trotsky to speak on his behalf at a Central Committee plenum in December, where the plans for the Soviet Union were sanctioned; these plans were then ratified on 30 December by the Congress of Soviets, resulting in the formation of the Soviet Union.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewin|1y=1969|1pp=40, 99–100|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=421|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=460–461, 468}} Despite his poor health, Lenin was elected chairman of the new government of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Rigby|1979|p=221}}

===Marxism and Leninism===
{{Main|Leninism|Marxism–Leninism|Trotskyism}}
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=We do not pretend that Marx or Marxists know the road to socialism in all its concreteness. That is nonsense. We know the direction of the road, we know what class forces will lead it, but concretely, practically, this will be shown by ''the experience of the millions'' when they undertake the act.|source=&hairsp;—Lenin, 11 September 1917{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=150}} }}

Lenin was a devout Marxist,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} and believed that his interpretation of Marxism, first termed "Leninism" by Martov in 1904,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=409}} was the sole authentic and orthodox one.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=35|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=237}} According to his Marxist perspective, humanity would eventually reach pure communism, becoming a stateless, classless, egalitarian society of workers who were free from [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], controlled their own destiny, and abided by the rule "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]".{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} According to Volkogonov, Lenin "deeply and sincerely" believed that the path he was setting Russia on would ultimately lead to the establishment of this communist society.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=206}}

Lenin's Marxist beliefs led him to the view that society could not transform directly from its present state to communism, but must first enter a period of socialism, and so his main concern was how to convert Russia into a socialist society. To do so, he believed that a dictatorship of the proletariat was necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and develop a socialist economy.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=35}} He defined socialism as "an order of civilized co-operators in which the [[means of production]] are socially owned",{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=432}} and believed that this economic system had to be expanded until it could create a [[Post-scarcity economy|society of abundance]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} To achieve this, he saw bringing the Russian economy under state control to be his central concern, with "all citizens" becoming "hired employees of the state" in his words.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=42–43}} Lenin's interpretation of socialism was centralised, planned, and statist, with both production and distribution strictly controlled.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} He believed that all workers throughout the country would voluntarily join to enable the state's economic and political centralisation.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=38}} In this way, his calls for "workers' control" of the means of production referred not to the direct control of enterprises by their workers, but the operation of all enterprises under the control of a "workers' state".{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=43–44, 63}} This resulted in what some perceive as two conflicting themes within Lenin's thought: popular workers' control, and a centralised, hierarchical, coercive state apparatus.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=36}}

[[File:Lenin 1919-03-18.jpg|thumb|left|Lenin speaking in 1919]]

Before 1914, Lenin's views were largely in accordance with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} Although he derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=203}} his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas from the Russian revolutionary movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=29|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=1}} including those of the Narodnik agrarian-socialists.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=173}} He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=13}} including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=57|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=151}} As Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}}

In his theoretical writings, particularly ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]],'' Lenin discussed what he regarded as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it had reached the new stage of [[state monopoly capitalism]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=34}} He believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, the presence of monopoly capitalism in Russia meant that the country was sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism.{{sfn|White|2001|pp=150–151}} Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its [[Emancipation|liberationist]] vision.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=3}}

===Democracy and the national question===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[Lenin] accepted truth as handed down by Marx and selected data and arguments to bolster that truth. He did not question old Marxist scripture, he merely commented, and the comments have become a new scripture.|source=—&hairsp;[[Louis Fischer]], 1964{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=213}} }}

Lenin believed that the [[representative democracy]] of capitalist countries gave the illusion of democracy while maintaining the "dictatorship of the bourgeoisie"; describing the representative democratic system of the United States, he referred to the "spectacular and meaningless duels between two bourgeois parties", both of whom were led by "astute multimillionaires" that exploited the American proletariat.{{sfn|Rice|1990|p=121}} He opposed liberalism, what, according to [[Dmitri Volkogonov]], was "a mark" of his general antipathy toward [[liberty]] as a value,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=471}} and believing that liberalism's freedoms were fraudulent because it did not free labourers from capitalist exploitation.{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=443}}

Lenin declared that "Soviet government is many millions of times more democratic than the most democratic-bourgeois republic", the latter of which was simply "a democracy for the rich".{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=310|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=442}} Lenin's belief as to what a proletarian state should look like nevertheless deviated from that adopted by the Marxist mainstream; European Marxists like Kautsky envisioned a democratically elected parliamentary government in which the proletariat had a majority, whereas Lenin called for a strong, centralised state apparatus that excluded any input from the bourgeois.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} He regarded his dictatorship of the proletariat as democratic because, he claimed, it involved the election of representatives to the [[Soviet (council)|soviet]]s, workers electing their own officials, and the regular rotation and involvement of all workers in the administration of the state.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=36–37}} However, as the Soviet state faced international isolation by the end of its victory in the Civil War and adopted NEP policies, which were also seen as a source of danger for the regime, Lenin stated that his government could "promise neither freedom nor democracy" until the threat of war or attack on the Soviet state was gone, just as any other government, he said, would act "in war", intending the denial of political freedoms to be provisional.{{sfn|Lewin|2005|p=41}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Suny |first=Ronald Grigor |author-link=Ronald Grigor Suny |title=Red Flag Wounded: Stalinism and the Fate of the Soviet Experiment |isbn=9781788730747 |page=141}}</ref>

Lenin was an [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] and a keen supporter of [[world revolution]], deeming national borders to be an outdated concept and nationalism a distraction from class struggle.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=54|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=423|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3p=352}} He believed that in a socialist society, the world's nations would inevitably merge and result in a single [[world government]].{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=88–89}} He believed that this socialist state would need to be a centralised, [[unitary state|unitary one]], and regarded [[federalism]] as a bourgeois concept.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=87|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=266}} In his writings, Lenin espoused [[anti-imperialist]] ideas and stated that all nations deserved "the right of self-determination".{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=87}} He supported [[wars of national liberation]], accepting that such conflicts might be necessary for a minority group to break away from a [[socialist state]], because socialist states are not "holy or insured against mistakes or weaknesses".{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=91, 93}}

Prior to taking power in 1917, he was concerned that ethnic and national minorities would make the Soviet state ungovernable with their calls for independence; according to the historian [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], Lenin thus encouraged Stalin to develop "a theory that offered the ideal of autonomy and the right of secession without necessarily having to grant either".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=266}} On taking power, Lenin called for the dismantling of the bonds that had forced minority ethnic groups to remain in the Russian Empire and espoused their right to secede but also expected them to reunite immediately in the spirit of proletariat internationalism.{{sfnm|1a1=Page|1y=1948|1p=17|2a1=Page|2y=1950|2p=354}} He was willing to use military force to ensure this unity, resulting in armed incursions into the independent states that formed in Ukraine, Georgia, Poland, Finland, and the Baltic states.{{sfn|Page|1950|p=355}} Only when its conflicts with Finland, the Baltic states, and Poland proved unsuccessful did Lenin's government officially recognise their independence.{{sfn|Page|1950|p=342}}

Lenin saw himself as a man of destiny and firmly believed in the righteousness of his cause and his own ability as a revolutionary leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1pp=159, 202|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2p=207}} Biographer [[Louis Fischer]] described him as "a lover of radical change and maximum upheaval", a man for whom "there was never a middle-ground.

Volkogonov said, while renouncing Leninist ideology, that "there can scarcely have been another man in history who managed so profoundly to change so large a society on such a scale."{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=326}} Lenin's administration laid the framework for the system of government that ruled Russia for seven decades and provided the model for later Communist-led states that came to cover a third of the inhabited world in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=391}} As a result, Lenin's influence was global.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=259}} A controversial figure, Lenin remains both reviled and revered,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=3}} a figure who has been both idolised and demonised.{{sfn|Read|2005|p=284}} Even during his lifetime, Lenin "was loved and hated, admired and scorned" by the Russian people.{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=414}} This has extended into academic studies of Lenin and Leninism, which have often been polarised along political lines.{{sfn|Liebman|1975|pp=19–20}}

In the Western world, biographers began writing about Lenin soon after his death; some such as [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] were sympathetic to him, and others such as Richard Pipes and [[Robert Gellately]] expressly hostile. Some later biographers such as Read and Lars Lih sought to avoid making either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes.{{sfnm|1a1=Lee|1y=2003|1p=14|2a1=Ryan|2y=2012|2p=3}} Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=14}} The Soviet view characterised him as a man who recognised the historically inevitable and accordingly helped to make the inevitable happen.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=123}} Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived him as a person who manipulated events to attain and then retain political power, moreover, considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=123}} Later, [[Historical revisionism|revisionists]] in both Russia and the West highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=124}}

Conversely, various Marxist observers, including Western historians Hill and [[John Rees (activist)|John Rees]], argued against the view that Lenin's government was a dictatorship, viewing it instead as an imperfect way of preserving elements of democracy without some of the processes found in liberal democratic states.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=120}} Ryan contends that the leftist historian [[Paul Le Blanc (historian)|Paul Le Blanc]] "makes a quite valid point that the personal qualities that led Lenin to brutal policies were not necessarily any stronger than in some of the major Western leaders of the twentieth century".{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=191}} Ryan also posits that for Lenin revolutionary violence was merely a means to an end, namely the establishment of a socialist, ultimately communist world—a world without violence.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=184}} Historian [[J.

Various biographers have stated that Lenin's writings were treated in a manner akin to [[religious scripture]] within the Soviet Union,{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=439|2a1=Pipes|2y=1996|2p=1|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=482}} while Pipes added that "his every opinion was cited to justify one policy or another and treated as gospel."{{sfn|Pipes|1996|p=1}} Stalin systematised Leninism through a series of lectures at the [[Sverdlov University]], which were then published as ''Questions of Leninism''.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1p=484|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=185|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=260, 284}} Stalin also had much of the deceased leader's writings collated and stored in a secret archive in the [[Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute]].{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|pp=274–275}} Material such as Lenin's collection of books in Kraków was also collected from abroad for storage in the institute, often at great expense.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=262}} During the Soviet era, these writings were strictly controlled and very few had access.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=261}} All of Lenin's writings that proved useful to Stalin were published, but the others remained hidden,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=263}} and knowledge of both Lenin's non-Russian ancestry and his noble status was suppressed.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=486}} In particular, knowledge of his Jewish ancestry was suppressed until the 1980s,{{sfnm|1a1=Petrovsky-Shtern|1y=2010|1p=99|2a1=Lih|2y=2011|2p=20}} perhaps out of Soviet antisemitism,{{sfn|Read|2005|p=6}} and so as not to undermine Stalin's Russification efforts,{{sfn|Petrovsky-Shtern|2010|p=108}} and perhaps so as not to provide fuel for anti-Soviet sentiment among international antisemites.{{sfn|Read|2005|p=6}} After the discovery of Lenin's Jewish ancestry, this aspect was repeatedly emphasised by the Russian far-right, who claimed that his inherited Jewish genetics explained his desire to uproot traditional Russian society.{{sfn|Petrovsky-Shtern|2010|pp=134, 159–161}} Under Stalin's regime, Lenin was actively portrayed as a close friend of Stalin's who had supported Stalin's bid to be the next Soviet leader.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=485}} During the Soviet era, five separate editions of Lenin's published works were published in Russian, the first beginning in 1920 and the last from 1958 to 1965; the fifth edition was described as "complete", but in reality, had much omitted for political expediency.{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1996|1pp=1–2|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=183}}

After Stalin's death, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became leader of the Soviet Union and began a process of [[de-Stalinisation]], citing Lenin's writings, including those on Stalin, to legitimise this process.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1pp=452–453|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=491–492|3a1=Lee|3y=2003|3p=131}} When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] took power in 1985 and introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'', he too cited these actions as a return to Lenin's principles.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=491–492}} In late 1991, amid the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] ordered the Lenin archive be removed from Communist Party control and placed under the control of a state organ, the [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History|Russian Centre for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History]], at which it was revealed that over 6,000 of Lenin's writings had gone unpublished. These were declassified and made available for scholarly study.{{sfn|Pipes|1996|pp=2–3}} Since 1991, there has been some discussion about moving Lenin's body from the [[Lenin mausoleum|mausoleum]] to the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] and burying it there. President Boris Yeltsin, with the support of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], intended to close the mausoleum and bury Lenin next to his mother, [[Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova]], at the [[Volkov Cemetery]] in Saint Petersburg. His successor, [[Vladimir Putin]], opposed this, stating that a reburial of Lenin would imply that generations of citizens had observed false values during seventy years of Soviet rule.<ref>See, e.g., a statement by President Putin in ''Sankt-Peterburgsky Vedomosty'', 19 July 2001.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=24 July 2001 |script-title=ru:Путин против захоронения тела Ленина |url=http://russian.peopledaily.com.cn/200107/19/rus20010719_48145.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314183828/http://russian.peopledaily.com.cn/200107/19/rus20010719_48145.html |archive-date=14 March 2018 |access-date=23 March 2018 |publisher=Женьминь Жибао |language=ru}}</ref>

In Russia in 2012, a proposal from a deputy belonging to the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]], with the support of some members of the governing [[United Russia]] party, proposed the removal of Lenin monuments in Russia. The proposal was strongly opposed by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] and was never considered.{{sfn|''The Moscow Times'', 24 October 2013}} Russia retained the vast majority of the 7,000 Lenin statues extant in 1991; as of 2022, there were approximately 6,000 monuments to Lenin in Russia.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 January 2012 |title=Relics of the Soviet era remain in Russia |url=https://www.rbth.com/articles/2012/01/23/unageing_monument_lenin_is_forever_14224.html}}</ref>

In Ukraine, during the 2013–2014 [[Euromaidan]] protests, Lenin statues were [[Demolition of monuments to Vladimir Lenin in Ukraine|damaged or destroyed]] by protesters in various cities across the country,{{sfn|BBC, 22 February 2014}} and in April 2015 the Ukrainian government ordered that all others be dismantled to comply with [[Decommunization in Ukraine|decommunisation laws]].{{sfn|BBC, 14 April 2015}} During the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine]] in 2022, many Lenin statues which had been taken down by Ukrainian activists in the preceding years, were [[Soviet imagery during the Russo-Ukrainian War|re-erected]] by Russian occupiers in [[Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine|Russian-occupied areas]]. These actions have less to do with communist propaganda and more with Lenin symbolizing Russia's domination over Ukraine.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Harding |first=Luke |date=23 April 2022 |title=Back in the Soviet Union: Lenin statues and Soviet flags reappear in Russian-controlled cities |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/back-in-the-ussr-lenin-statues-and-soviet-flags-reappear-in-russian-controlled-cities |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220504233450/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/back-in-the-ussr-lenin-statues-and-soviet-flags-reappear-in-russian-controlled-cities |archive-date=4 May 2022 |access-date=4 May 2022 |work=[[The Guardian]] |authorlink1=Luke Harding}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Fink |first=Andrew |date=20 April 2022 |title=Lenin Returns to Ukraine |url=https://thedispatch.com/p/lenin-returns-to-ukraine |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220423185553/https://thedispatch.com/p/lenin-returns-to-ukraine |archive-date=23 April 2022 |access-date=4 May 2022 |work=[[The Dispatch]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Bowman |first=Verity |date=27 April 2022 |title=Kyiv pulls down Soviet-era monument symbolising Russian-Ukrainian friendship |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/04/27/kyiv-pulls-soviet-era-monument-symbolising-russian-ukrainian/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220427204034/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/04/27/kyiv-pulls-soviet-era-monument-symbolising-russian-ukrainian/ |archive-date=27 April 2022 |access-date=4 May 2022 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Trofimov |first=Yaroslav |date=1 May 2022 |title=Russia's Occupation of Southern Ukraine Hardens, With Rubles, Russian Schools and Lenin Statues |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-occupation-of-southern-ukraine-hardens-with-rubles-russian-schools-and-lenin-statues-11651403176 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220503233746/https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-occupation-of-southern-ukraine-hardens-with-rubles-russian-schools-and-lenin-statues-11651403176 |archive-date=3 May 2022 |access-date=4 May 2022 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |authorlink1=Yaroslav Trofimov}}</ref> Beginning in 1998, the independent agency Levada has perennially conducted polls measuring the perception of Lenin's legacy among Russians: in 2017, 56% of respondents believed Lenin played a positive role in the country's history, while 22% believed he had played a negative role;<ref>{{Cite web |date=5 November 2017 |title=100 Years After Revolution, Most Russians Say Lenin Played Positive Role: Poll |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-lenin-positive-role-levada-poll/28441045.html |website=Radio Free Europe}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=19 April 2017 |title=Levada Center: Vladimir Lenin |url=https://www.levada.ru/2017/04/19/vladimir-lenin/ |language=ru}}</ref> in 2024, the former figure had increased to an all-time high of 67%.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 16, 2024 |title="Ideas about the personality of Vladimir Lenin and his role in the history of the country" |url=https://www.levada.ru/2024/04/16/predstavleniya-o-lichnosti-vladimira-lenina-i-ego-roli-v-istorii-strany/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240502103840/https://www.levada.ru/2024/04/16/predstavleniya-o-lichnosti-vladimira-lenina-i-ego-roli-v-istorii-strany/ |archive-date=May 2, 2024 |website=Levada}}</ref>

===In the international communist movement===
[[File:Detalle de Lenin.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''[[Man, Controller of the Universe]]'', a fresco by [[Diego Rivera]] in the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in [[Mexico City]], depicting Lenin]]
According to Lenin biographer [[David Shub]], writing in 1965, it was Lenin's ideas and example that "constitutes the basis of the Communist movement today".{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=10}} Socialist states following Lenin's ideas appeared in various parts of the world during the 20th century.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=5}} Writing in 1972, the historian [[Marcel Liebman]] stated that "there is hardly any insurrectionary movement today, from Latin America to Angola, that does not lay claim to the heritage of Leninism."{{sfn|Liebman|1975|p=22}}

After Lenin's death, Stalin's administration established an ideology known as [[Marxism–Leninism]], a movement that came to be interpreted differently by various contending factions in the communist movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=9|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=482}} After being forced into exile by Stalin's administration, Trotsky argued that Stalinism was a debasement of Leninism, which was dominated by bureaucratism and Stalin's own personal dictatorship.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=132}}

Marxism–Leninism was adapted to many of the 20th century's most prominent revolutionary movements, forming into variants such as [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], [[Juche]], [[Ho Chi Minh Thought]], and [[Castroism]].{{sfn|Read|2005|p=283}} Conversely, many later Western communists, such as [[Manuel Azcárate]] and Jean Ellenstein, who were involved in the [[Eurocommunist]] movement, expressed the view that Lenin and his ideas were irrelevant to their own objectives, thereby embracing a Marxist but not Marxist–Leninist perspective.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=132–133}}
