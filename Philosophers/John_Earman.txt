'''John Earman''' (born 1942) is an American [[philosopher of physics]]. He is an [[emeritus professor]] in the [[History and Philosophy of Science]] department at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. He has also taught at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], [[Rockefeller University]], and the [[University of Minnesota]], and was president of the [[Philosophy of Science Association]].

==Life and career==
John Earman was born in Washington, D.C. in 1942. Earman received his PhD at [[Princeton University]] in 1968<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hps.pitt.edu/profile/earman.php |title=John Earman |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |access-date=May 2, 2023}}</ref> with a dissertation on temporal asymmetry (titled ''Some Aspects of Temporal Asymmetry'') and it was directed by [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] and [[Paul Benacerraf]]. After holding professorships at UCLA, the Rockefeller University, and the University of Minnesota, he joined the faculty of the History and Philosophy of Science department of the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rescher |first=Nicholas |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/About/The_Berlin_School.pdf |title=THE BERLIN SCHOOL OF LOGICAL EMPIRICISM AND ITS LEGACY |date=July 6, 2006 |access-date=May 2, 2023 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh}}</ref> He remained at Pittsburgh for the rest of his career.

Earman is a former president of the [[Philosophy of Science Association]] and a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Sciences]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hps.pitt.edu/people/john-earman|title=John Earman &#124; History and Philosophy of Science &#124; University of Pittsburgh|website=www.hps.pitt.edu}}</ref>  He is a member of the Archive Board of the Phil-Sci Archive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/information.html|title=About the Archive – PhilSci-Archive|website=philsci-archive.pitt.edu}}</ref>

==The hole argument==
{{further|Hole argument}}
Earman has notably contributed to debate about the "[[hole argument]]". The hole argument was invented for different purposes by [[Albert Einstein]] late in 1913 as part of his quest for the [[general theory of relativity]] (GTR). It was revived and reformulated in the modern context by John3 (a short form for the "three Johns": John Earman, [[John Stachel]], and John Norton).

With the GTR, the traditional debate between [[Universality (philosophy)|absolutism]] and [[relationalism]] has been shifted to whether or not [[spacetime]] is a substance, since the GTR largely rules out the existence of, e.g., absolute positions. The "hole argument" offered by John Earman is a powerful argument against [[manifold substantialism]].

This is a technical mathematical argument but can be paraphrased as follows:

Define a function <math>d</math> as the identity function over all elements over the [[manifold]] <math>M</math>, excepting a small neighbourhood ([[topology]]) <math>H</math> belonging to <math>M</math>. Over <math>H</math>, <math>d</math> comes to differ from identity by a smooth function.

With use of this function <math>d</math> we can construct two mathematical models, where the second is generated by applying <math>d</math> to proper elements of the first, such that the two models are identical prior to the time <math>t=0</math>, where <math>t</math> is a time function created by a [[foliation]] of spacetime, but differ after <math>t=0</math>.

These considerations show that, since substantialism allows the construction of holes, that the universe must, on that view, be indeterministic. Which, Earman argues, is a case against substantialism, as the case between [[determinism]] or [[indeterminism]] should be a question of physics, not of our commitment to substantialism.
