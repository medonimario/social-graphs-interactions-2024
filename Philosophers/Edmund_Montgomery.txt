'''Edmund Duncan Montgomery''' (March 19, 1835 – April 17, 1911) was a [[Scottish-American]] [[philosopher]], [[scientist]] and [[physician]]. He was the husband of [[German-American]] [[sculptor]] [[Elisabet Ney]].

==Early life==

Montgomery was born on 19 March 1835, in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]].  His parentage is unknown, but the [[Elisabet Ney Museum]] relates the possibility that he was the son of Isabella Davidson (or Montgomery) and a prominent Scottish jurist, [[Duncan McNeill, 1st Baron Colonsay]]. He and his mother lived in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and [[Frankfurt, Germany|Frankfurt]], supplemented by a trust fund for him.<ref name="Shady Ladies: Nineteen Surprising and Rebellious American Women"/><ref name="Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery">{{cite web|title=Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/montgomery_biography.html|publisher=Elisabet Ney Museum|access-date=29 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124032043/http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/montgomery_biography.html|archive-date=24 January 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

By the time he entered his teens, he began to be interested in the [[philosophical]] works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].  While still living in Frankfurt and only 13 years old, he participated in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]].<ref name="Edmund Montromery"/>

==Education==

In 1852, Montgomery studied medicine at the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he did lab work under [[Robert Bunsen]] and came under the influence of [[Christian Kapp]], [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach]] and [[Jacob Moleschott]].<ref name="Edmund Montromery"/>  He later attended lectures by [[Johannes Peter Müller]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] during his 1855–1856 enrollment.  While studying in  [[Bonn, Germany|Bonn]]  1856–1857, he attended influential lectures of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]].<ref name="Edmund Montromery"/>

==Medical practice==

Montgomery received his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree from the [[University of Würzburg]] on February 18, 1858.<ref name="Edmund Montromery"/>

Montgomery interned at [[Prague]] and [[Vienna]]. He served his residency at the [[German Hospital, Dalston]] ([[London]]) and Bermondsay Dispensary.  While doing biological research, he became [[Curator]] of the [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and Demonstrator of Morbid Anatomy.<ref name="Edmund Montgomery Pioneer of Organicism">{{cite journal|last=Keeton|first=Morris T|title=Edmund Montgomery Pioneer of Organicism|jstor=2707145|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=1947|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|volume=8|issue=3|pages=309–341|doi=10.2307/2707145}}</ref> He was elected to the [[Royal College of Physicians|Royal College of Physicians of London]] in 1862.

After being diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] in 1863, Montgomery left the Royal College of Physicians of London and established medical practices on the resort island of [[Madeira]] (1863–1865), in [[Menton]] (1866) on the [[French Riviera]], and also in [[Rome]] (1867) and [[Munich]] (1868), while continuing to do his research. A [[life annuity]] allowed him to retire from medical practice in 1869, and devote the rest of his life to philosophy, scientific research, and writing.<ref name="Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery"/><ref name="Edmund Montromery"/><ref name="Edmund Montgomery and Elisabet Ney papers"/>

==Medicine==

Montgomery's work in medicine included the study of [[cell theory]].

==Philosophy==

Montgomery's study of philosophy complemented his work as a physical scientist. He saw life as the ability of certain chemical compounds to resist damage. He commented on [[conceptions of knowledge]] and [[self (philosophy)|self]] in over sixty journal articles and five books. He was an advocate of [[humanitarianism]] and a "religion of life," focusing on the idea that man must not ignore the potential of his own yet-to-be-completed evolutionary process.

The two most significant papers written by Montgomery were his ''Refutation of Kant From the Standpoint of the Empirical'' (1870) and ''The Revelation of Present Experience ''(1910).<ref name="Edmund Montromery"/>

In the former, Montgomery convincingly refutes Immanuel Kant's a priori, the lynchpin of Kant's system, and in the latter, he insists that all knowledge (no exceptions) is based on the evidence provided by the senses.

Montgomery was an advocate of [[non-Darwinian evolution]] and [[organicism]]. He was also cited as a defender of [[vitalism]]. He authored ''The Vitality and Organization of Protoplasm'' (1904) and ''Philosophical Problems in the Light of Vital Organization''.<ref>Driesch, Hans. (1914).

==Personal life==

While a student at the University of Heidelberg in 1853, Montgomery began a courtship with sculptor [[Elisabet Ney]], who was visiting friends in the city.  They were married at the [[British consulate]] in Madeira on November 7, 1863.<ref name="Shady Ladies: Nineteen Surprising and Rebellious American Women">{{cite book|last=Ledbetter|first=Suzann|title=Shady Ladies: Nineteen Surprising and Rebellious American Women|year=2006|publisher=Forge Books|isbn=978-0-7653-0827-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/shadyladiesninet00ledb/page/179 179–192]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/shadyladiesninet00ledb/page/179}}</ref>

Montgomery was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] in 1863.  By 1870, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] had begun. In the autumn of that year, Ney became pregnant with their first child.  Montgomery received a letter from his friend, Baron Carl Vicco Otto Friedrich Constantin von Stralendorff of [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], who had moved to [[Thomasville, Georgia]], with his new wife, Margaret Elizabeth Russell of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], declaring the location "Earth's paradise."<ref name="Elisabet Ney Emigration 1871-1873">{{cite web|title=Elisabet Ney Emigration 1871–1873|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/emigration.html|publisher=City of Austin Parks and Recreation Dept|access-date=31 October 2010|archive-date=11 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311030004/http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/emigration.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>  On January 14, 1871, Ney and Montgomery, accompanied by their housekeeper, Cenci, emigrated to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], to a colony promoted as a resort for [[tuberculosis|consumptives]]. Their first son, Arthur (1871–1873) was born there, and second son, Lorne (1872–1913), was born in [[Red Wing, Minnesota]], during one of their travels.<ref name="Elisabet Ney Emigration 1871-1873"/>  Baron and Baroness von Stralendorff returned to [[Wismar, Germany]], where he died on July 1, 1872.<ref name="Edmund Montgomery and Elisabet Ney papers">{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00145/smu-00145.html|title=Edmund Montgomery and Elisabet Ney papers|publisher=SMU|access-date=29 October 2010}}</ref><ref name="The New England Historical and Genealogical Register">{{cite book|last=New England Historic Genealogical Society Staff|title=The New England Historical and Genealogical Register|year=1873|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society Staff|page=291}}</ref><ref name="The Hermit Philosopher of Liendo">{{cite book|last=Stephens|first=Ira Kendrick|title=The Hermit Philosopher of Liendo|year=1951|publisher=Southern Methodist University Press|page=136}}</ref>

In 1873, Ney traveled alone to Texas. With the help of German Consul Julius Runge in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], Ney was shown [[Liendo Plantation]] near [[Hempstead, Texas|Hempstead]] in [[Waller County, Texas|Waller County]].  On March 4, 1873, Montgomery and the rest of the family arrived, and he purchased it. While he tended to his research, Ney ran it for the next twenty years. Their son, Arthur, died of [[diphtheria]] in 1873.<ref name="Elisabet Ney Liendo 1873-1891">{{cite web|title=Elisabet Ney Liendo 1873–1891|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/liendo.html|publisher=City of Austin Parks and Recreation Dept|access-date=31 October 2010}}</ref><ref name="From Jamestown to Texas">{{cite book|last=Meischen|first=Betty Smith|title=From Jamestown to Texas|year=2002|publisher=IUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-24223-8|pages=43–45}}</ref>

Montgomery was involved in an advisory capacity in the founding of [[Prairie View A&M]], originally called Prairie View Normal School.<ref name="Edmund Montromery">{{cite web|last=Stephens|first=I K|title=Edmund Montromery|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fmo10|work=Handbook of Texas online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association|access-date=29 October 2010}}</ref>
 
Montgomery became a naturalized United States citizen, and thereafter became active in local politics and events. He served two terms as Waller County Road Commissioner and oversaw the building of an iron bridge across the [[Brazos River]].  In 1903, he was elected president of the Texas Academy of Science.<ref name="Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery"/><ref name="Texas Academy of Science 1892-1913">{{cite web|last=Ward-McLemore|first=Ethel|title=Texas Academy of Science 1892–1913 |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/snt01|work=Handbook of Texas online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association|access-date=29 October 2010}}</ref>
