'''Frank Cameron Jackson''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO|FASSA|FAHA}} {{small|[[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]]}} (born 31 August 1943) is an Australian [[analytic philosopher]] and [[Emeritus|Emeritus Professor]] in the School of Philosophy (Research School of Social Sciences) at [[Australian National University]] (ANU) where he had spent most of the latter part of his career. His primary research interests include  [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[meta-ethics]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. In the latter field he is best known for the "Mary's room" [[knowledge argument]], a [[thought experiment]] that is one of the most discussed challenges to [[physicalism]].

At ANU, he served as Director of the Institute of Advanced Studies (1998–2001), Deputy Vice-Chancellor – Research (2001), and Director of the Research School of Social Sciences (2004–7).

Jackson was awarded the [[Order of Australia]] in 2006 for service to philosophy and [[social sciences]] as an [[Academy#Academic personnel|academic]], [[Academic administration|administrator]], and [[researcher]]. Jackson delivered the [[John Locke Lectures]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1995. Notably, his father had also delivered the 1957–8 lectures, making them the first father–son pair to have done so.<ref>''Supervenience, Metaphysics, and Analysis'' ([[John Locke Lectures]]), Oxford University, 1994–95</ref><ref name=":1" />

==Philosophical work==
Jackson's philosophical research is broad, but focuses primarily on the areas of [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and [[meta-ethics]].

In philosophy of mind, Jackson is known especially for the ''knowledge argument'' against [[physicalism]]—the view that the universe is entirely physical (i.e., the kinds of entities postulated in physics). Jackson motivates the knowledge argument by a famous [[thought experiment]] known as [[Mary's room]]. In a much cited passage<ref>{{Citation |last1=Nida-Rümelin |first1=Martine |title=Qualia: The Knowledge Argument |date=2021 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2021/entries/qualia-knowledge/ |access-date=2022-04-19 |edition=Summer 2021 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |last2=O Conaill |first2=Donnchadh |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}.</ref> he phrases the thought experiment as follows:{{cquote|Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like 'red', 'blue', and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence 'The sky is blue'. (…) What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor? Will she learn anything or not? It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world and our visual experience of it. But then is it inescapable that her previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the physical information. Ergo there is more to have than that, and Physicalism is false.

}}Jackson's thought experiment features in the 1996 [[Channel 4]] documentary "Brainspotting"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Alter |first=Torin |title=Knowledge Argument Against Physicalism |url=https://iep.utm.edu/know-arg/ |access-date=2022-04-19 |website=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |language=en-US}}</ref> and [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s novel ''Thinks...''

Jackson used the knowledge argument, as well as other arguments, to establish a sort of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], according to which certain [[mental states]], especially [[observation|qualitative]] ones, are non-physical. The view that Jackson urged was a modest version of [[epiphenomenalism]]—the view that certain mental states are non-physical and, although caused to come into existence by physical events, do not then cause any changes in the physical world.

However, Jackson later rejected the knowledge argument,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/publications/proceedings/v76n3/public/abstracts.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516091824/http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/publications/proceedings/v76n3/public/abstracts.asp|archive-date=2008-05-16|url-status=dead|title=Jackson's Retraction|author=Torin Alter |publisher=APA }}</ref> as well as other arguments against [[physicalism]]:

{{cquote|Most contemporary philosophers given a choice between going with science and going with intuitions, go with science. Although I once dissented from the majority, I have capitulated and now see the interesting issue as being where the arguments from the intuitions against physicalism—the arguments that seem so compelling—go wrong.

}}

Jackson argues that the intuition-driven arguments against physicalism (such as [[Mary's room|the knowledge argument]] and the [[Philosophical zombie|zombie argument]]) are ultimately misleading.

Jackson is also known for his defence of the centrality of conceptual analysis to philosophy; his approach, set out in his Locke Lectures and published as his 1998 book, is often referred to as the [[Canberra Plan]].

==Honours==
Jackson was elected Fellow of the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]] (FAHA) in 1981<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date= |title=Frank Jackson |url=https://humanities.org.au/fellows/fellow-profile/?fellow_id=172 |access-date=2018-12-01 |website=Australian Academy of the Humanities |language=en-AU}}</ref> and of the [[Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia]] (FASSA) in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date= |title=Emeritus Professor Frank Jackson AO |url=https://socialsciences.org.au/academy-fellow/?sId=0032v000033l9Q7AAI |access-date=2018-12-01 |website=Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia |language=en-US}}</ref>

He was awarded the [[Centenary Medal]] in 2001<ref>[https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/1126743 It's an Honour: Centenary Medal]. Retrieved 22 November 2014</ref> and appointed an Officer of the [[Order of Australia]] (AO) in 2006.<ref>[https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/1131312 It's an Honour: AO]. Retrieved 22 November 2014</ref>

In 2003 he was appointed as Distinguished Professor at the Australian National University and Emeritus Professor in 2014. In November 2018 Jackson received the Peter Baume Award, which recognises substantial and significant achievement and merit.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/peter-baume-award-emeritus-professor-frank-jackson-ao|title=Peter Baume Award: Emeritus Professor Frank Jackson AO|date=2018-11-15|work=ANU|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}</ref>
