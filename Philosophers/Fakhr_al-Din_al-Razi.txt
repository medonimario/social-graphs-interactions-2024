== Biography ==
{{Ash'arism}}
Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, whose full name was ''Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn ʿUmar ibn al-Ḥusayn'' ({{langx|ar|أبو عبد الله محمد بن عمر بن الحسين}}), was born in 1149 or 1150 CE (543 or 544 [[Hijri year|AH]]) in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] (close to modern [[Tehran]]), whence his [[Nisba (onomastics)|{{transliteration|ar|nisba}}]] al-Razi.<ref name="harvnb|Anawati|1960–2007"/> According to [[Ibn al-Sha'ar al-Mawsili|Ibn al-Shaʿʿār al-Mawṣilī]] (died 1256), one of al-Razi's earliest biographers, his great-grandfather had been a rich merchant in [[Mecca]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{harvnb|Shihadeh|2013–2019|pp=viii–ix}}.</ref> Either his great-grandfather or his grandfather migrated from Mecca to [[Tabaristan]] (a mountainous region located on the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] coast of northern [[Iran]]) in the 11th century, and some time after that the family settled in Ray.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Having been born into a family of Meccan origin, al-Razi claimed descent from the first caliph [[Abu Bakr]] ({{circa|573–634}}), and was known by medieval biographers as al-Qurashī (a member of the [[Quraysh]], the tribe of the prophet [[Muhammad]] to which also Abu Bakr belonged).<ref>{{harvnb|Shihadeh|2013–2019|p=ix}}; cf. {{harvnb|Cannon|1998|p=347}}: "The family claimed both a long tribal ancestry (associated with the [[Banu Taym|Taimi]] tribe) and descent from the family of Abu Bakr, the first caliph".</ref> However, it is not clear from which precise lines of descent al-Razi envisioned his purported ties with Abu Bakr to result, and the poet [[Ibn Unayn|Ibn ʿUnayn]] (died 1233) actually praised him as a descendant of the second caliph [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] (died 644).<ref>{{harvnb|Shihadeh|2013–2019|p=ix}}. On Ibn ʿUnayn, see {{harvnb|Masarwa|2021}}.</ref>

Fakhr al-Din first studied with his father, [[Diya' al-Din al-Makki|Ḍiyāʾ al-Dīn al-Makkī]], himself a scholar of some repute whose ''magnum opus'' in [[kalam]] has recently been rediscovered in part,<ref>Facsimile in {{harvnb|Shihadeh|2013–2019}}.</ref> and later at [[Merv]] and [[Maragheh]], where he was one of the pupils of Majd al-Din al-Jili, who in turn had been a disciple of [[al-Ghazali]]. He was a leading proponent of the [[Ash'ari]] school of theology.

His commentary on the [[Quran]] was the most-varied and many-sided of all extant works of the kind, comprising most of the material of importance that had previously appeared. He devoted himself to a wide range of studies and is said to have expended a large fortune on experiments in [[alchemy]]. He taught at Ray (Central Iran) and [[Ghazni]] (eastern [[Afghanistan]]), and became head of the university founded by Mohammed ibn Tukush at Herat (western Afghanistan).<ref name=nie>{{NIE|wstitle=Fakhr-ad-Din ar-Razi|inline=1}}</ref>

In his later years, he also showed interest in [[Sufism|mysticism]], though this never formed a significant part of his thought.<ref name=Cooper/> He died in [[Herat]] (Afghanistan) in 1209 (606 AH), where his tomb is still venerated today.<ref name="harvnb|Anawati|1960–2007"/> Many believe he was poisoned by the [[Karramiyya|Karrāmīyah]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fakhr ad-Dīn ar-Rāzī {{!}} Muslim Theologian, Philosopher, Scientist {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fakhr-ad-Din-ar-Razi |access-date=2023-07-09 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

==''The Great Commentary''==
{{Main|Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)}}
One of Imam Razi's outstanding achievements was his unique interpretive work on the Quran called ''Mafātiḥ al-Ghayb'' (''Keys to the Unseen'') and later nicknamed ''Tafsīr al-Kabīr'' (''The Great Commentary''), one reason being that it was 32 volumes in length. This work contains much of philosophical interest. One of his "major concerns was the [[self-sufficiency]] of the intellect." His "acknowledgment of the primacy of the Qur'an grew with his years." Al-Razi's [[rationalism]] undoubtedly "holds an important place in the debate in the Islamic tradition on the harmonization of reason and revelation."<ref name=Cooper/>

==Development of Kalam==
Al-Razi's development of [[Kalam]] (Islamic scholastic theology) led to the evolution and flourishing of theology among Muslims. Razi had experienced different periods in his thinking, affected by the [[Ash'ari]] school of thought and later by al-Ghazali. Al-Razi tried to make use of elements of [[Muʿtazila]] and ''[[Islamic philosophy#Falsafa|Falsafah]]'', and although he had some criticisms on ibn Sina, Razi was greatly affected by him. The most important instance showing the synthesis of Razi's thought may be the problem of the eternity of the world and its relation to God. He tried to reorganize the arguments of theologians and philosophers on this subject, collected and critically examined the arguments of both sides. He considered, for the most part, the philosophers' argument for the world's eternity stronger than the theologians' position of putting emphasis on the temporal nature of the world.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KdN9JLuKTYC&q=Fakhr%2520Razi&pg=PA59|title=Fakhr Al-Dīn Al-Rāzī and Thomas Aquinas on the Question of the Eternity of the World|last=İskenderoğlu|first=Muammer|date=2002-01-01|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004124802|language=en}}</ref> According to Tony Street, we should not see in Razi's theoretical life a journey from a young [[dialectician]] to a religious condition.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3nHpsDBm6QC|title=Islam - Essays in Scripture, Thought and Society: A Festschrift in Honour of Anthony H.

== Hypothetical concept of multiple universes ==
Al-Razi, in dealing with his [[Physics in medieval Islam|conception of physics]] and the physical world in his ''Matalib al-'Aliya'', criticizes the idea of the [[geocentric model]] within the universe and "explores the notion of the existence of a [[multiverse]] in the context of his commentary" on the [[Quran]]ic verse, "All praise belongs to God, Lord of the Worlds." He raises the question of whether the term "[[world]]s" in this verse refers to "multiple worlds within this single [[universe]] or [[cosmos]], or to many other universes or a multiverse beyond this known universe."<ref name=Setia></ref>

Al-Razi states:<ref name="Setia"/>{{blockquote|It is established by evidence that there exists beyond the world a void without a terminal limit (''khala' la nihayata laha''), and it is established as well by evidence that God Most High has power over all contingent beings (''al-mumkinat''). Therefore He the Most High has the power (''qadir'') to create millions of worlds (''alfa alfi 'awalim'') beyond this world such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world as well as having the like of what this world has of the throne (''al-arsh''), the chair (''al-kursiyy''), the heavens (''al-samawat'') and the earth (''al-ard''), and the sun (''al-shams'') and the moon (''al-qamar''). The arguments of the philosophers (''dala'il al-falasifah'') for establishing that the world is one are weak, flimsy arguments founded upon feeble premises.}}

Al-Razi rejected the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] notions of a single universe revolving around a single world.<ref name=Setia/><ref name="universe"/> He describes their main arguments against the existence of multiple worlds or universes, pointing out their weaknesses and refuting them. This rejection arose from his affirmation of [[atomism]], as advocated by the [[Ash'ari]] school of [[Islamic theology]], which entails the existence of vacant space in which the atoms move, combine and separate {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. He discussed more on the issue of the [[Void (astronomy)|void]] – the empty spaces between stars and constellations in the [[universe]], that contain few or no stars – in greater detail in volume 5 of the ''Matalib''.<ref name=Setia/> He argued that there exists an infinite [[outer space]] beyond the known world,<ref name=Iskenderoglu>{{citation|title=Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī and Thomas Aquinas on the question of the eternity of the world|author=Muammer İskenderoğlu|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|date=2002|isbn=90-04-12480-2|page=79}}</ref> and that God has the power to fill the [[vacuum]] with an infinite number of universes.<ref name="Cooper"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Alikuzai|first=Hamid Wahed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WRlAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA139|title=A Concise History of Afghanistan in 25 Volumes|publisher=Trafford|year=2013|pages=139|isbn=9781490714462}}</ref>
