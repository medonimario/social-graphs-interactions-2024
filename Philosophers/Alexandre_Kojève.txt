==Life==
[[File:Alexandre Kojève.jpg|thumb|Kojève in Berlin, 1922]]

Aleksandr Vladimirovich Kozhevnikov was born in the Russian Empire to a wealthy and influential family. His uncle was the [[Abstract art|abstract artist]] [[Wassily Kandinsky]], about whose work he would write an influential essay in 1936. He was educated at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and the [[Heidelberg University|University of Heidelberg]], both in Germany. In Heidelberg, he completed in 1926 his PhD thesis on the Russian religious philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Soloviev]]'s views on the union of God and man in Christ under the direction of [[Karl Jaspers]]. The title of his [[thesis]] was ''Die religiöse Philosophie Wladimir Solowjews'' (''The Religious Philosophy of Vladimir Soloviev'').

Early influences included the philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] and the historian of science [[Alexandre Koyré]]. Kojève spent most of his life in France and from 1933 to 1939 delivered in Paris a series of lectures on [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s work ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. After the Second World War, Kojève worked in the French Ministry of Economic Affairs as one of the chief planners to form the [[European Economic Community]].

Kojève studied and used [[Sanskrit]], Chinese, [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], Latin and [[Classical Greek]]. He was also fluent in French, German, Russian and English.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Frost |first=Bryan-Paul |date=2011-03-01 |title=James H.

Kojève died in 1968, shortly after giving a talk to civil servants and state representatives for the European Economic Community (now the [[European Union]]) in Brussels on behalf of the French government.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Auffret |first=Dominique |title=Alexandre Kojève |date=2002 |isbn=978-2253943204 |pages=414–5 |publisher=Grasset |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=van Batenburg |first=Robbert Alexander |date=5 April 2023 |title=Alexandre Kojève and his Quest to Actualize the 'Universal and Homogenous State' |url=https://history.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2023/05/van-Batenburg-Robbert_thesis.pdf |journal=[[Columbia University]] |pages=57 |access-date=8 August 2023 |archive-date=10 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230810230233/https://history.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2023/05/van-Batenburg-Robbert_thesis.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Philosophy ==
=== Hegel lectures ===
{{Hegelianism}}
Although not an orthodox [[Marxism|Marxist]],<ref name="Kołakowski">[[Leszek Kołakowski|Kołakowski, Leszek]]. ''Main Currents of Marxism''. Trans. P. S. Falla. New York and London: W.W. Norton and Company, 2005. {{ISBN|0-393-06054-3}}. p. 929.</ref> Kojève was known as an influential and idiosyncratic interpreter of Hegel, reading him through the lens of both [[Karl Marx]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. The well-known [[end of history]] thesis advanced the idea that [[Ideology|ideological]] history in a limited sense had ended with the [[French Revolution]] and the regime of [[Napoleon]] and that there was no longer a need for violent struggle to establish the "rational supremacy of the regime of rights and equal recognition". Kojève's end of history is different from [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s later thesis of the same name in that it points as much to a [[Mixed economy|socialist-capitalist synthesis]] as to a triumph of [[liberal capitalism]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Kojeve |first=Alexandre |title=Capitalisme et socialisme: Marx est Dieu; Ford est son prophète.

Kojève's lectures on Hegel were collected, edited and published by Raymond Aron in 1947, and published in abridged form in English in the now classic ''[[Introduction to the Reading of Hegel|Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. His interpretation of Hegel has been one of the most influential of the past century. His lectures were attended by a small but influential group of intellectuals including [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[André Breton]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Raymond Aron]], [[Michel Leiris]], [[Henry Corbin]] and [[Éric Weil]]. His interpretation of the [[master–slave dialectic]] was an important influence on [[Jacques Lacan]]'s [[mirror stage]] theory. Other French thinkers who have acknowledged his influence on their thought include the [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] philosophers [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]].

=== Friendship with Leo Strauss ===
Kojève had a close and lifelong friendship with [[Leo Strauss]] which began when they were philosophy students in Berlin. The two shared a deep philosophical respect for each other. Kojève would later write that he "never would have known [...] what philosophy is" without Strauss.<ref>Lilla 2001, p. 131.</ref> In the 1930s, the two began a debate on the relation of philosophy to politics that would come to fruition with Kojève's response to Strauss' ''On Tyranny''.

Kojève, a senior statesman in the French government, argued that philosophers should have an active part in shaping political events. On the other hand, Strauss believed that philosophy and politics were fundamentally opposed and that philosophers should not have a substantial role in politics, noting the disastrous results of Plato in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. Philosophers should influence politics only to the extent that they can ensure that philosophical contemplation remains free from the seduction and coercion of power.<ref name="Strauss"/>

In spite of this debate, Strauss and Kojève remained friendly. In fact, Strauss would send his best students to Paris to finish their education under Kojève's personal guidance. Among these were [[Allan Bloom]], who endeavored to make Kojève's works available in English and published the first edition of Kojève's lectures in English, and [[Stanley Rosen]].

== Political views ==
=== Marxism ===
According to his own account shortly before his death, Kojève was a communist from youth, and was enthusiastic regarding Bolshevik revolution. However, he "knew that the establishment of communism meant thirty terrible years.", so he ran away.<ref name="LapougeKojeve">{{cite web |last1=Lapouge |first1=Gilles |last2=Kojève |first2=Alexandre |title=« Les philosophes ne m'intéressent pas, je cherche des sages », une conversation avec Alexandre Kojève |url=https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2020/12/25/conversation-alexandre-kojeve/ |website=Le grand continent |date=25 December 2020 |access-date=26 July 2023 |archive-date=26 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230726091106/https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2020/12/25/conversation-alexandre-kojeve/ |url-status=live }}</ref> From now on, he once claimed in his letter to [[Tran Duc Thao]], dated October 7, 1948, that his "... course was essentially a work of propaganda intended to strike people's minds.

In an article to magazine Yevraziya, a left [[Eurasianism|Eurasianist]] journal, he praised the CPSU's struggle against bourgeois philosophy, arguing that it would lead to something new, whether one calls it proletarian or not:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kojève |first1=Alexandre |title=Philosophy and the Communist Party |journal=[[Radical Philosophy]] |date=2021 |issue=211 |pages=31–33 |url=https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/philosophy-and-the-communist-party |access-date=26 July 2023 |archive-date=26 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230726085603/https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/philosophy-and-the-communist-party |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Blockquote
|text="(...) Marxist philosophy can express the world view of the new ruling class and new culture, and every other philosophy is subject to destruction. (...) Everything currently taking place in the USSR is so significant and new that any assessment of the Party's cultural or 'philosophical' politics cannot be founded on preconceived cultural values or preformed philosophical systems. (...) the question of the Party's 'philosophical politics' can be assessed, it seems, not entirely negatively. (...) Toward the end of the nineteenth century Western thought effectively concluded its development [...] turning into a philosophical school of 'scholasticism' in the popular, negative sense of the term. (...) being a philosopher, one can nevertheless welcome 'philosophical politics' leading to the complete prohibition of the study of philosophy. (...) The Party is fighting against bourgeois culture in the name of proletarian culture. Many find the word 'proletariat' not to their taste. This is after all only a word. The essence of the matter does not change, and the essence consists in the fact that a battle is raging with something old, already existing, in the name of something new, which has yet to be created. Anyone who will welcome the appearance of a truly new culture and philosophy – either because it will be neither Eastern nor Western, but Eurasian, or simply because it will be new and lively in contrast to the already crystallised and dead cultures of the West and East – should also accept everything that contributes to this appearance. It seems to me, for the time being of course, that the Party's policies directed against bourgeois (that is, ultimately Western) culture is really preparation for a new culture of the future. (...)"
}}

[[Mark Lilla]] notes that Kojève rejected the prevailing concept among some European [[intellectual]]s of the 1930s that [[capitalism]] and [[democracy]] were failed artifacts of [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] that would be destroyed by either [[communism]] or [[fascism]].<ref>Lilla 2001, pp. 123–124.</ref>

While initially somewhat more sympathetic to the [[Soviet Union]] than the United States, Kojève devoted much of his thought to protecting [[Western Europe|western European]] autonomy, particularly relating to France, from domination by either the Soviet Union or the United States. He believed that the capitalist United States represented [[Right Hegelians|right-Hegelianism]] while the state-socialist Soviet Union represented [[Young Hegelians|left-Hegelianism]]. Thus, victory by either side, he posited, would result in what Lilla describes as "a [[Rationality|rationally]] organized [[bureaucracy]] without [[Social class|class distinctions]]".<ref>Lilla 2001, p. 124.</ref>

=== Stalin and the Soviet Union ===
Kojève's views of Stalin, while changing after World War II, was positive. Kojève's interest for Stalin, however, might have been continued, whether positive or negative, after World War II. According to [[Isaiah Berlin]], a contemporary of Kojève and his friend, during their meeting in Paris c. 1946-1947, they talked about Stalin and the USSR. Berlin comments on his relations with Stalin, saying "(...) Kojéve was an ingenious thinker and imagined that Stalin was one too. (...) He said that he wrote to Stalin, but received no reply. I think that perhaps he identified himself with Hegel, and Stalin with Napoleon. (...)"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berlin |first1=Isaiah |last2=Jahanbegloo |first2=Ramin |title=Conversations with Isaiah Berlin |date=1991 |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-684-19394-9 |page=65 |edition=1st |url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit0000berl/page/65/ |access-date=26 July 2023}}</ref>

The most important result of this era was Kojève's work addressed to Stalin, ''Sofia, filo-sofia i fenomeno-logia'' (''[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]], Philo-sophy and Phenomeno-logy''), a manuscript of more than 900 pages that was penned between 1940 and 1941.<ref name="Weslati">{{cite journal |last1=Weslati |first1=Hager |title=Kojève's letter to Stalin |journal=[[Radical Philosophy]] |date=2014 |issue=184 |page=7 |url=https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/wp-content/files_mf/rp184_article1_weslati_kojeveslettertostalin.pdf |access-date=2023-07-26 |archive-date=2023-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231223015640/https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/wp-content/files_mf/rp184_article1_weslati_kojeveslettertostalin.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> In that manuscript, according to [[Boris Groys]], Kojève defended his thesis that the "universal and homogeneous state in which the Sage can emerge and live is none other than Communism" and "scientific Communism of Marx–Lenin–Stalin is an attempt to expand the philosophical project to its ultimate historical and social borders". According to Groys, "Kojève sees the end of history as the moment of the spread of wisdom through the whole population – the democratization of wisdom; a universalization that leads to homogenization. He believes that the Soviet Union moves towards the society of wise men in which every member will have self-consciousness."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Groys |first1=Boris |title=Romantic bureaucracy: Alexander Kojève's post-historical wisdom |journal=[[Radical Philosophy]] |date=2016 |issue=196 |page=32 |url=https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/wp-content/files_mf/rp196_dossier_groys_romanticbureaucracy18.pdf |access-date=26 July 2023 |archive-date=26 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230726085603/https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/wp-content/files_mf/rp196_dossier_groys_romanticbureaucracy18.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to Weslati, several versions of ''Sofia'', including a typesetted copy, had been completed in the first week of March 1941, and one of them was given to Soviet vice consul in person by Kojève. Soviet consul "... promised to send the letter with the next diplomatic bag to Moscow." However, "[l]ess than three months later, the embassy and its contents would be put to the torch by Nazi troops."<ref name="Weslati" /> It's not known whether Kojève's work had reached the USSR or was burned with the embassy.

In 1999, ''[[Le Monde]]'' published an article reporting that a French intelligence document showed that Kojève had spied for the [[Soviets]] for over thirty years.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1999/09/16/la-dst-avait-identifie-plusieurs-agents-du-kgb-parmi-lesquels-le-philosophe-alexandre-kojeve_3569776_1819218.html?xtmc=kojeve_espion&xtcr=5|title = La DST avait identifié plusieurs agents du KGB parmi lesquels le philosophe Alexandre Kojève|newspaper = Le Monde.fr|date = 16 September 1999|access-date = 12 April 2021|archive-date = 12 April 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210412185406/https://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1999/09/16/la-dst-avait-identifie-plusieurs-agents-du-kgb-parmi-lesquels-le-philosophe-alexandre-kojeve_3569776_1819218.html?xtmc=kojeve_espion&xtcr=5|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.politico.eu/article/russian-stalinist-behind-the-treaty-of-rome/|title = Russian Stalinist who invented Europe|date = 22 March 2017|access-date = 12 April 2021|archive-date = 12 April 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210412185823/https://www.politico.eu/article/russian-stalinist-behind-the-treaty-of-rome/|url-status = live}}</ref>

Although Kojève often claimed to be a [[Stalinist]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardwebster.net/thecultoflacan.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020910203351/http://www.richardwebster.net/thecultoflacan.html|url-status=usurped|archive-date=September 10, 2002|title=The Cult of Lacan: Freud, Lacan and the mirror-stage|author=Richard Webster|work=richardwebster.net|quote=From Kojève Lacan learnt not only a version of Hegel but also the techniques of seduction and intellectual enslavement with which this charismatic teacher, who defined himself as a 'Stalinist of the strictest obedience', enthralled and mesmerized his students.|year=1994|access-date=2010-09-29}}</ref> he largely regarded the Soviet Union with contempt, calling its social policies disastrous and its claims to be a truly classless state ludicrous. Kojève's cynicism towards traditional Marxism as an outmoded philosophy in industrially well-developed [[Capitalism|capitalist]] nations prompted him to go as far as idiosyncratically referring to capitalist [[Henry Ford]] as "the one great authentic Marxist of the twentieth century".<ref name="Nichols-P90">Nichols, James H. ''Alexandre Kojève: Wisdom at the End of History''. Lanham, Md.: Rowman & Littlefield, 2007. {{ISBN|0-7425-2777-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7425-2777-5}}. p. 90.</ref> He specifically and repeatedly called the Soviet Union the only country in which 19th-century capitalism still existed. His Stalinism was quite ironic, but he was serious about Stalinism to the extent that he regarded the utopia of the Soviet Union under Stalin and the willingness to purge unsupportive elements in the population as evidence of a desire to bring about the end of history and as a repetition of the [[Reign of Terror]] of the French Revolution.<ref>Geroulanos, ''An Atheism That Is Not Humanist Emerges in French Thought'', pp. 133–134.</ref>

=== Kojève and zionism ===
According to [[Isaiah Berlin]], Kojève was not fond of the idea of a state of Israel. Berlin's several different accounts, like the ones published in the Jewish Chronicle in 1973, in [[The Jerusalem Report]] in October 1990, and in his interview with [[Ramin Jahanbegloo]] in 1991 (also published as a book), are about his meeting with Kojève.

According to the 1973 account, "ten years ago or more" he was "dining in Paris with a distinguished historian of philosophy who was also a high official of the French Government", namely, Kojève.<ref name="BerlinIsrael1">{{cite web |last1=Berlin |first1=Isaiah |author1-link=Isaiah Berlin |title=Israel: A Nation among Nations |url=https://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib135.pdf |website=The Isaiah Berlin Virtual Library |access-date=26 July 2023 |pages=1–3 |date=1973 |archive-date=26 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230726085607/https://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib135.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> 1990 account also records that they were talking in [[Russian language|Russian]].<ref name="BerlinIsrael2">{{cite journal |last1=Berlin |first1=Isaiah |last2=Furstenberg |first2=Rochelle |title=Reflections of a Zionist Don |journal=[[The Jerusalem Report]] |date=1990 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=51 |url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/218740009 |access-date=26 July 2023 |id={{ProQuest|218740009}} |quote=(...) There was a French philospher called Monsieur Kojève. He was originally Russian. We talked Russian. He was a very interesting man. He said to me: "You're a Jew.

For our purposes, for Jews, Albania is a step forward.}}</ref> While talking, the issue of Israel and zionism was also discussed. Kojève, who "was plainly taken aback" at Berlin's defence of zionism, asked Berlin:<ref name="BerlinIsrael1" />

}}

In return, according to the interview with Jahanbegloo, Berlin replied: "For the Jews to be like Albania constitutes progress. Some 600,000 Jews in Romania were trapped like sheep to be slaughtered by the Nazis and their local allies. A good many escaped. But 600,000 Jews in Palestine did not leave because Rommel was at their door. That is the difference.

The purpose of Zionism is normalization; the creation of conditions in which the Jews could live as a nation, like the others. Alexandre Kojève, whom I spoke of before, once said to me: ''“The Jews have the most interesting history of any people. Yet now they want to be what? Albania? How can they?”'' I said: “For the Jews to be like Albania constitutes progress. Some 600,000 Jews in Romania were trapped like sheep to be slaughtered by the Nazis and their local allies. A good many escaped. But 600,000 Jews in Palestine did not leave because Rommel was at their door. That is the difference. They considered Palestine to be their own country, and if they had to die, they would die not like trapped animals, but for their country.” That’s what I mean. I don’t want Jews to stop living where they live. If they do not mind being a minority, that is in order. There is nothing wrong with being a minority. Some people feel minorities to be a disturbing element—T. S. Eliot, for example, or the French ''intégralistes'' who influenced him. Minorities are often a valuable stimulus to the majority, a leaven, a source of fermentation. But nobody should be forced to be a minority. If you don’t want to belong to a minority, and you want a normal life, you can fully attain it only in a country whose culture is yours. This path must be opened.}}</ref> "We reached no agreement.", records Berlin.<ref name="BerlinIsrael1" />

Kojève's correspondence with [[Leo Strauss]] has been published along with Kojève's critique of Strauss's commentary on [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Hiero (Xenophon)|Hiero]]''.<ref name="Strauss">{{citation |last=Strauss |first=Leo |title=On Tyranny |editor-last=Gourevitch |editor-first=Victor |editor2-last=Roth |editor2-first=Michael S.}}.</ref> In the 1950s, Kojève also met the rightist legal theorist [[Carl Schmitt]], whose "Concept of the Political" he had implicitly criticized in his analysis of Hegel's text on "Lordship and Bondage" {{Additional citation needed|date=February 2021}}. Another close friend was the Jesuit Hegelian philosopher [[Gaston Fessard]], whom with also had correspondence.

In addition to his lectures on the ''Phenomenology of Spirit,'' Kojève's other publications include a little noticed book on [[Immanuel Kant]] and articles on the relationship between [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] and [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist thought]] and Christianity. His 1943 book ''Esquisse d'une phenomenologie du droit'', published posthumously in 1981, elaborates a theory of justice that contrasts the aristocratic and bourgeois views of the right. ''Le Concept, le temps et le discours'' extrapolates on the Hegelian notion that wisdom only becomes possible in the fullness of time. Kojève's response to Strauss, who disputed this notion, can be found in Kojève's article "The Emperor Julian and his Art of Writing".<ref>Published in {{citation |title=Ancients and Moderns: Essays on the Tradition of Political Philosophy in Honor of Leo Strauss |year=1964 |editor-last=Cropsey |editor-first=Joseph |publisher=Basic Books}}, as well as in the above-mentioned edition of Strauss's ''On Tyranny.''</ref> Kojève also challenged Strauss' interpretation of [[the classics]] in the voluminous ''Esquisse d'une histoire raisonnée de la pensée païenne'' which covers the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], as well as [[Neoplatonism]]. While the first volume of the previous work was still published during his life-time, most of his writings remained unpublished until recently. These are becoming the subject of increased scholarly attention.

The books that have so far been published are the two remaining volumes of the ''Esquisse d'une histoire raisonnée de la pensée païenne'' (1972, 1973 [1952]), ''Outline of a Phenomenology of Right'' (1981 [1943]), ''L'idée du déterminisme dans la physique classique et dans la physique moderne'' (1990 [1932]), ''Le Concept, le Temps et Le Discours'' (1990 [1952]), ''L'Athéisme'' (1998 [1931]), ''The Notion of Authority'' (2004 [1942]), and ''Identité et Réalité dans le "Dictionnaire" de Pierre Bayle'' (2010 [1937]). Several of his shorter texts are also gathering greater attention and some are being published in book form as well.
