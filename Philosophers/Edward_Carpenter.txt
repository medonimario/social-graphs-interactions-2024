==Early life==
Born at 45 Brunswick Square, [[Hove]] in [[Sussex]], Carpenter was educated at nearby [[Brighton College]], where his father Charles Carpenter<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170520182612/http://www.edwardcarpenter.net/ecdd2.htm Picture of "my father" Charles Carpenter]</ref> was a governor. His brothers Charles, George and Alfred also went to school there. Edward's grandfather was Vice-Admiral James Carpenter (d 1845). When he was ten, Carpenter displayed a flair for the piano.<ref name=Days>{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardcarpenter.net/ecdd1.htm|title=Edward Carpenter, ''My Days and Dreams'', London: Unwin, 1916.|access-date=29 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520180805/http://www.edwardcarpenter.net/ecdd1.htm|archive-date=20 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

His academic ability became evident relatively late in his youth, but was sufficient to earn him a place at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]].<ref name=Rowbotham>Rowbotham 2009.</ref> At Trinity Hall, Carpenter came under the influence of [[Christian Socialist]] theologian [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F. D. Maurice]].<ref name="Oxford">Birch, Dinah, ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''. Oxford, [[Oxford University Press]], 2009. {{ISBN|9780191030840}} (p. 197).</ref> Whilst there he also began to explore his feelings for men. One of the most notable examples of this is his close friendship with [[Edward Anthony Beck]] (later Master of Trinity Hall), which, according to Carpenter, had "a touch of romance".<ref name=Days/> Beck eventually ended their friendship, causing Carpenter great emotional heartache. Carpenter graduated as 10th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] in 1868.<ref name="Ref_a">{{acad|id=CRPR864E|name=Carpenter, Edward}}</ref> After university, he was ordained as [[curate]] of the [[Church of England]], "as a convention rather than out of deep Conviction",<ref name="Ref_b">[http://www.edwardcarpenter.net/ecbiog.htm Philip Taylor's Biography of Carpenter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927080348/http://www.edwardcarpenter.net/ecbiog.htm |date=27 September 2017 }}, Philip Taylor 1988</ref> and served as curate to Maurice at the parish of [[St Edward King and Martyr, Cambridge|St Edward's, Cambridge]].

In 1871 Carpenter was invited to become tutor to the royal princes [[George V of the United Kingdom|George Frederick]] (later King George V) and his elder brother, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence]], but declined the position. His lifelong friend and fellow Cambridge student [[John Neale Dalton]] took the position.<ref>Aronson p.48.</ref> Carpenter continued to visit Dalton while he was tutor. They were given photographs of the pair, taken by the princes.<ref>Aronson p.50.</ref>

In the following years he experienced an increasing sense of dissatisfaction with his life in the church and university, and became weary of what he saw as the hypocrisy of Victorian society.<ref name=Days/> He found great solace in reading poetry, later remarking that his discovery of the work of [[Walt Whitman]] caused "a profound change" in him.<ref>Carpenter, ''My Days and Dreams'' p.&nbsp;64.</ref> Five or six years later he visited Whitman in [[Camden, New Jersey]], in 1877.

==Move to the North of England==
[[File:Carpenter1875.jpg|thumb|left|Edward Carpenter in 1875]]

Carpenter was voluntarily released from the Anglican ministry and left the church in 1874 and moved to [[Leeds]], becoming a [[lecturer]]  as part of University Extension Movement, which was formed by academics who wished to widen access to education in deprived communities. He lectured in [[astronomy]], the lives of ancient Greek women and [[music]] and had hoped to lecture to the [[working class]]es, but found his lectures were mostly attended by [[middle class]] people, many of whom showed little active interest in the subjects he taught.  Disillusioned,<ref name=Days/> he moved to [[Chesterfield, Derbyshire|Chesterfield]], but finding that town dull, moved to nearby [[Sheffield]] a year later.<ref name=Rowbotham/> Here he came into contact with manual workers, and he began to write poetry. His sexual preferences were for working men: "the grimy and oil-besmeared figure of a stoker" or "the thick-thighed hot coarse-fleshed young bricklayer with a strap around his waist".<ref>Aronson p.49 citing d'Arch Smith, Love in Earnest p. 192</ref>

When his father Charles Carpenter died in 1882, Edward inherited the sum of £6,000 ({{Inflation|UK|6000|1882|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation/fn|US}}).<ref>{{cite book | last=Rowbotham | first=Sheila | author-link= Sheila Rowbotham | title=Edward Carpenter: a life of liberty and love | publisher=Verso | location=London | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-84467-295-0}}</ref> This enabled Carpenter to quit his lectureship to seek the simpler life, first on a [[small holding]] at Totley near Sheffield with Albert Ferneyhough, a scythe-maker, and his family in 1880; Albert and Edward became lovers and in 1883 moved to  [[Millthorpe, Derbyshire]] together with Albert's family, where Carpenter built a large new house with outbuildings in 1883 constructed of local gritstone with a slate roof, in the style of the seventeenth century.<ref name="odnb">{{cite odnb |first=Chushichi |last=Tsuzuki |title=Carpenter, Edward (1844–1929) |id=32300 |orig-year=2004 |year=2012 }}</ref> There they had a small market garden and made and sold leather sandals,<ref name="historicengland.org.uk" /> based on the design of sandals sent to him from India by [[Harold Cox]] on Carpenter's request.<ref name="historicengland.org.uk" />

Carpenter popularised the phrase the "Simple Life" in his essay ''Simplification of Life'' in his ''England's Ideal'' (1887).{{sfn|Delany|1987|loc=p.&nbsp;10}} Sheffield architect [[Raymond Unwin]] was a frequent visitor to Millthorpe and the simple revival of vernacular English architecture at Millthorpe and Carpenter's 'simple life' there were powerful influences on Unwin's later [[Garden city movement|Garden City]] architecture and ideals, suggesting as they did a coherent but radical new lifestyle.<ref name="historicengland.org.uk">{{cite web |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/lgbtq-heritage-project/homes-and-domestic-spaces/millthorpe-and-edward-carpenter/ |title=Millthorpe and Edward Carpenter |website=Historic England |access-date=March 16, 2021}}</ref>

In Sheffield, Carpenter became increasingly radical.<ref name="historicengland.org.uk" /> Influenced by a disciple of [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Henry Hyndman]], he joined the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF) in 1883 and attempted to form a branch in the city.  The group instead chose to remain independent, and became the [[Sheffield Socialist Society]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://socialismtoday.org/archive/131/carpenter.html |title=Edward Carpenter: Red, Green and Gay |journal=SocialismToday |date=September 2009 |access-date=March 16, 2021}}</ref> While in the city he worked on a number of projects including highlighting the poor living conditions of industrial workers. In 1884, he left the SDF with [[William Morris]] to join the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]]. From there he stayed with [[William Harrison Riley]] while he was visiting [[Walt Whitman]].<ref>David Goodway, ''[[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow]]'', p. 44</ref>

In 1883, Carpenter published the first part of ''Towards Democracy'', a long poem expressing Carpenter's ideas about "spiritual democracy" and how Carpenter believed humanity could move towards a freer and more just society. ''Towards Democracy'' was heavily influenced by Whitman's poetry, as well as the [[Hindu]] scripture, the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.<ref name="Oxford" /><ref name="Robertson">Robertson, Michael, ''Worshipping Walt: The Whitman Disciples'' [[Princeton University Press]], 2010 {{ISBN|0691146314}} (pp. 179–180)</ref> Expanded editions of ''Towards Democracy'' appeared in 1885, 1892, and 1902; the complete edition of ''Towards Democracy'' was published in 1905.<ref name="Robertson" />

In 1886–87 Carpenter was in a relationship with George Hukin, a razor grinder.<ref name="odnb"/> Carpenter lived with [[Cecil Reddie]] from 1888 to 1889 and in 1889 helped Reddie found [[Abbotsholme School]] in [[Derbyshire]] as a notably progressive alternative to the traditional public school, with the financial support of Robert Muirhead and [[William Cassels]].<ref>{{cite web

In May 1889, Carpenter wrote a piece in the ''Sheffield Independent'' calling Sheffield the laughing-stock of the civilized world and said that the giant thick cloud of smog rising out of Sheffield was like the smoke arising from [[Judgment Day]], and that it was the altar on which the lives of many thousands would be sacrificed. He said that 100,000 adults and children were struggling to find sunlight and air, enduring miserable lives, unable to breathe and dying of related illnesses.<ref>Edward Carpenter, Letter, ''Sheffield Independent'' (25 May 1889)</ref>

==Travel in India==
Drawn increasingly to [[Hindu philosophy]], he travelled to [[India]] and [[Ceylon]] in 1890.  Following conversations with the guru Ramaswamy (known as the Gnani) there, he developed the conviction that socialism would bring about a revolution in human consciousness as well as of economic conditions.   His account of the travel was published in 1892 as  ''From Adam's Peak to Elephanta: Sketches in Ceylon and India''.  The book's spiritual explorations would subsequently influence the Russian author [[Peter Ouspensky]], who discusses it extensively in his own book, ''[[Tertium Organum]]'' (1912).

==Life with George Merrill==
[[File:Carpenter et Merrill.jpg|thumb|Carpenter and Merrill {{Circa|1900}}]]
On his return from India in 1891, he met [[George Merrill (gay activist)|George Merrill]], a working-class man also from Sheffield, 22 years his junior, and after the Ferneyhoughs left Millthorpe in 1893 Merrill became Carpenter's companion. The two remained partners for the rest of their lives,<ref name="odnb" /> cohabiting from 1898.<ref name="Rowbotham" /> Merrill, the son of an engine driver, had been raised in the slums of Sheffield and had little formal education.

Carpenter remarked in his work ''The Intermediate Sex'':
<blockquote>
Eros is a great leveller. Perhaps the true Democracy rests, more firmly than anywhere else, on a sentiment which easily passes the bounds of class and caste, and unites in the closest affection the most estranged ranks of society. It is noticeable how often [[Uranian (sexology)|Uranian]]s of good position and breeding are drawn to rougher types, as of manual workers, and frequently very permanent alliances grow up in this way, which although not publicly acknowledged have a decided influence on social institutions, customs and political tendencies.<ref name="Ref_c">Edward Carpenter ''The Intermediate Sex'', p.114-115</ref>

Carpenter included among his friends the scholar, author, naturalist, and founder of the [[Humanitarian League]], [[Henry S. Salt]], and his wife, Catherine;<ref>{{cite book |author=George and Willene Hendrick |title=The Savour of Salt: A Henry Salt Anthology |publisher=Centaur Press |year=1989 |page=153}}</ref> the critic, essayist and sexologist, [[Havelock Ellis]], and his wife, Edith; actor and producer [[Ben Iden Payne]]; Labour activists [[John Bruce Glasier|Bruce]] and [[Katharine Glasier]]; writer and scholar, [[John Addington Symonds]]; and the feminist writer, [[Olive Schreiner]].<ref>Gray, Stephen. 2013.

[[E. M. Forster]] was a close friend and visited the couple regularly. He later recounted that it was a visit to Millthorpe in 1913 that inspired him to write his gay-themed novel, ''[[Maurice (novel)|Maurice]]''.<ref name="symondson" /><ref name="Rowse">{{cite book |last=Rowse |first=A.

The relationship between Carpenter and Merrill was an inspiration for the relationship between Maurice Hall and Alec Scudder, the gamekeeper in ''Maurice''.<ref name="sutherland" /><ref name="Rowse" /> The author [[D. H. Lawrence]] read the manuscript of ''Maurice'', which was published posthumously in 1971. Carpenter's rural lifestyle and the manuscript influenced Lawrence's 1928 novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' which, though built around a central relationship between a man and a woman, involves a gamekeeper and a member of the [[upper-class]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Helen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cF_eCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT242 |title=Masculinity, Class and Same-Sex Desire in Industrial England, 1895-1957 |date=5 October 2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781137470997 |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>King, Dixie (1982) "The Influence of Forster's ''Maurice'' on ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''" in ''[[Contemporary Literature (journal)|Contemporary Literature]]'' Vol. 23, No. 1 (Winter, 1982), pp. 65-82</ref>

In 1902 Carpenter's [[anthology]] of verse and prose, ''[[Iolaus|Ioläus]]: An Anthology of Friendship'', was published.<ref name="Ref_d">The 1917 New York edition is now available as a free e-book</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/iolaus.html |title=People with a History: An Online Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Trans* History |publisher=fordham.edu |date=1997 |access-date=24 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/iolusanthology00carp|title=Ioläus : an anthology of friendship|first1=Edward|last1=Carpenter|first2=D.

In 1915, he published ''The Healing of Nations and the Hidden Sources of Their Strife'', where he argued that the source of war and discontent in western society was class-monopoly and social inequality.

Carpenter became an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]].<ref>[[Martin A. Larson|Larson, Martin Alfred]]. (1977).

The death of George Hukin in 1917 at the age of 56 seems to have broken Carpenter's attachment to the North of England. In 1922 he and Merrill moved to [[Guildford]], Surrey <ref name="Ref_e">[http://www.brightonourstory.co.uk/newsletters/winter99/edward.htm Brighton Ourstory Project – Lesbian and Gay History Group<!-- Bot-generated title -->] at www.brightonourstory.co.uk</ref> and the two lived at 23 Mountside Rd.<ref name=exploring>{{cite web |url=http://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/themes/people/writers/edward_carpenter/ |title=Edward Carpenter (1844 – 1929) |publisher=exploringsurreyspast.org.uk |date=2012 |access-date=24 March 2018}}</ref> On Carpenter's 80th birthday he was presented an album signed by every member of the then [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government, headed by [[Ramsay MacDonald]], Prime Minister, who Carpenter had known since his teenage years.<ref>The Times, 'Edward Carpenter,Democratic Author and Poet', June 29, 1929 p.14</ref>

In January 1928, Merrill died suddenly, having become dependent on alcohol since moving to Surrey.<ref name=Rowbotham/> His death devastated Carpenter; he sold their joint home and moved in with his carer Ted Inigan.<ref name=exploring/> In May 1928, Carpenter suffered a paralytic [[stroke]]. He lived another 13 months before he died on 28 June 1929, aged 84.<ref name=Rowbotham/> He was interred in the same grave as Merrill at the [[Mount Cemetery]] in Guildford under a lengthy invocation written by Carpenter.<ref name="historicengland.org.uk"/>

His obituary in [[The Times]] was headed "Edward Carpenter, Author and Poet",<ref>The Times, Saturday June 29th, 1929 p.14.</ref> though the text did also refer to his political campaigns.

==Influence==
Carpenter corresponded with many leading figures in political and cultural circles, among them [[Annie Besant]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Havelock Ellis]], [[Roger Fry]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Keir Hardie]], [[Jack London]], [[George Merrill (gay activist)|George Merrill]], [[E.

[[Fenner Brockway]], in a 1929 obituary of Carpenter, acknowledged him as an influence on Brockway and his associates when young.

Carpenter was sometimes called "the English [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]" and Tolstoy himself considered him "a worthy heir of [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] and [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]".<ref name="odnb"/>

==Revival of reputation==
Following his death, Carpenter's written works fell out of print and were largely forgotten except among devotees of British labour movement history. However, in the 1970s and 1980s, interest in his work was revived by historians such as [[Jeffrey Weeks (sociologist)|Jeffrey Weeks]] and [[Sheila Rowbotham]], and some of Carpenter's works were reprinted by the [[Gay Men's Press]].<ref>"Edward Carpenter's role in rethinking sexual embodiment and theorizing homosexuality – or 'Uranism' as he termed it – has received welcome attention in the past few decades. The republication of his works by the Gay Men's Press and enlightening studies by the likes of Sheila Rowbotham and Jeffrey Weeks in the late 1970s and early 1980s coincided with the decline of Marxist orthodoxy as attention shifted to alternative radical histories- of gender and sexuality - within the academy and beyond."
