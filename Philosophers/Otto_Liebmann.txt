'''Otto Liebmann''' ({{IPA|de|ˈliːpman|lang}}; 25 February 1840 – 14 January 1912) was a German [[neo-Kantian]] [[philosopher]].

==Biography==
He was born at [[Löwenberg]], [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]], into a [[Jewish]] family,<ref>[[Paul W. Franks]], "Jewish Philosophy after Kant: the Legacy of Salomon Maimon" in Michael L. Morgan & [[Peter Gordon (historian)|Peter Eli Gordon]] (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Jewish Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press (2007), p. 53</ref> and educated at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Halle|Halle]]. He was made professor at [[University of Strasbourg|Strassburg]] (1872) and went to [[University of Jena|Jena]] in 1882. He died at [[Jena]]. The mathematician [[Heinrich Liebmann]] was his son.

==Philosophical work==
A forerunner of [[neo-Kantianism]], in his best-known book, ''Kant und die Epigonen'', he deals with the philosophy after [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], discussing [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]], [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]], [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Having credited Kant's philosophy (though criticizing it on the vital point of accepting a [[Noumenon|thing-in-itself]]), he focuses on what he sees as the shortcomings in the approaches of Kants successors. He frequently ends a section with the statement that one should return to Kant.

Liebmann's work also influenced his Jena colleague [[Gottlob Frege]].<ref>Gottfried Gabriel, "Frege, Lotze, and the Continental Roots of Early Analytic Philosophy," in: Erich H. Reck (ed.). ''From Frege to Wittgenstein: Perspectives on Early Analytic Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2002, pp. 39–51, esp. 44–48.</ref>
