'''George of Trebizond''' ({{langx|el|Γεώργιος Τραπεζούντιος}}; 1395–1486) was a Byzantine Greek [[philosopher]], scholar, and [[Renaissance Humanist|humanist]].

==Life==

He was born on the Greek island of [[Crete]] (then a Venetian colony known as the [[Kingdom of Candia]]), and derived his surname '''Trapezuntius''' from the fact that his ancestors were from the [[Byzantine]] Greek [[Trapezuntine Empire]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: George of Trebizond |url=https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06456a.htm |access-date=2022-08-10 |website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref>

When he went to [[Italy]] is not certain; according to some accounts he was summoned to [[Venice]] about 1430 to act as [[amanuensis]] to [[Francesco Barbaro (politician)|Francesco Barbaro]], who appears to have already made his acquaintance; according to others he did not visit [[Italy]] until the time of the [[Council of Florence]] (1438–1439).<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Mack |first=Peter |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/727710175 |title=A history of Renaissance rhetoric, 1380-1620 |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-959728-4 |location=Oxford |pages=39–47 |oclc=727710175}}</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He learned [[Latin]] from [[Vittorino da Feltre]], and made such rapid progress that in three years he was able to teach [[Latin literature]] and [[rhetoric]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> His reputation as a teacher and a translator of [[Aristotle]] was very great, and he was selected as secretary by [[Pope Nicholas V]], an ardent Aristotelian. The bitterness of his attacks upon [[Plato]] (in the ''Comparatio Aristotelis et Platonis'' of 1458,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} described by historian [[James Hankins]] as "one of the most remarkable mixtures of learning and lunacy ever penned"), which drew forth a powerful response from [[Bessarion]] (''In calumniatorem Platonis'', printed in 1469)<ref>{{cite book |last=Hanegraaff | first=Wouter |year=2012 | title=Esotericism and the Academy: Rejected Knowledge in Western Culture | publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780521196215|page=79}}</ref> and the manifestly hurried and inaccurate character of his translations of Plato, Aristotle and other classical authors, combined to ruin his fame as a scholar, and to endanger his position as a teacher of [[philosophy]]. (Pope [[Pius II]] was among the critics of George's translations.) The indignation against George on account of his first-named work was so great that he would probably have been compelled to leave Italy had not [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] given him protection at the court of Naples.<ref name=":0" />{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He subsequently returned to [[Rome]], where in 1471 he published a very successful Latin grammar based on the work of another Greek grammarian of Latin, [[Priscian]]. Additionally, an earlier work on Greek rhetorical principles garnered him wide recognition, even from his former critics who admitted his brilliance and scholarship. He died in great poverty in 1486 in Rome.

His son, Andrea of Trebizond (''da Trebisonda'') was also a classic scholar and translator in Rome.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hg5BAQAAMAAJ Dizionario biografico universale], Volume 5, by Felice Scifoni, Publisher Davide Passagli, Florence (1849); page 395.</ref>
