'''Joseph Marie, comte de Maistre'''{{efn|''Maistre'' is traditionally pronounced {{IPA|fr|mɛstʁ|}} (i.e. sounding the "s" and rhyming with ''[[wikt:bourgmestre|bourgmestre]]''); that is how it is usually heard at university and in historical movies (as in [[Sacha Guitry]]'s 1948 film {{Interlanguage link|Le Diable boiteux (film)|fr|3=Le Diable Boiteux (film)|lt=''Le Diable Boiteux''|vertical-align=sup}}). The pronunciation {{IPA|fr|mɛːtʁ|}} (rhymes with ''[[wikt:maître|maître]]'') is sometimes heard under the influence of the modernized pronunciation, adopted by some descendants (such as Patrice de Maistre)}} (1 April 1753 – 26 February 1821)<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title= Joseph de Maistre |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |url= https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-de-Maistre}}</ref> was a [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoyard]] philosopher, writer, lawyer, diplomat, and magistrate.

"Ultra-Royalism Revisited," ''Modern Age'', Vol. 39, No. 3, p. 305.</ref> Despite his close personal and intellectual ties with France, Maistre was throughout his life a subject of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], which he served as a member of the Savoy Senate (1787–1792), ambassador to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] (1803–1817),<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/dublinreview33londuoft#page/418/mode/2up "Joseph de Maistre,"] ''The Dublin Review'', Vol. XXXIII, 1852.</ref> and minister of state to the court in [[Turin]] (1817–1821).<ref>The issue of Maistre's national identity has long been contentious. In 1802, after the invasion of Savoy and [[Piedmont]] by the armies of the [[French First Republic]], Maistre had fled to [[Cagliari]], the ancient capital of Kingdom of Sardinia that resisted the French invasion; he wrote to the French ambassador in [[Naples]], objecting to having been classified as a French ''[[émigré]]'' and thus subject to confiscation of his properties and punishment should he attempt to return to Savoy. According to the biographical notice written by his son Rodolphe and included in the ''Complete Works'', on that occasion Maistre wrote: {{blockquote|"He had not been born French, and did not desire to become French, and that, never having set foot in the lands conquered by France, he could not have become French."| ''Œuvres complètes de Joseph de Maistre'', Lyon, 1884, vol.

In 1860, Albert Blanc, professor of law at the [[University of Turin]], in his preface to a collection of Maistre's diplomatic correspondence wrote that {{blockquote|"this philosopher [Maistre] was a politician; this Catholic was an Italian; he foretold the destiny of the [[House of Savoy]], he supported the end of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia|Austrian rule]] [of northern Italy], he has been, during this century, one of the first defenders of [Italian] independence."|''Correspondance diplomatique de Joseph de Maistre'', Paris, 1860, vol.

[[File:Portrait of Joseph de Maistre.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Stipple engraving of Maistre from a painting by [[Pierre Bouillon]] in which he is shown wearing the insignia of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]]]]
Maistre was probably educated by the [[Jesuits]].<ref name=cath/> After the Revolution, he became an ardent defender of the Jesuits, increasingly associating the spirit of the Revolution with the Jesuits' traditional enemies, the [[Jansenists]]. After completing his training in the law at the [[University of Turin]] in 1774, he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a senator in 1787. 

In his early years Maistre was a liberal and supporter of [[Gallicanism]]. The philosopher and mystic [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin]] was a major and lasting influence for Maistre. In one of his first public addresses Maistre praised the [[American Revolution]] proclaiming "Liberty, insulted in Europe, has winged its flight to another hemisphere."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Murray |first=John C |date=1949 |title=The Political Thought of Joseph De Maistre|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1404500.|journal= The Review of Politics |volume=11 |issue=1 |page=72|doi=10.1017/S0034670500044685 |jstor=1404500 }}</ref>

Maistre fled Chambéry when it was taken by a French revolutionary army in 1792, but he was unable to find a position in the royal court in Turin and returned the following year. Deciding that he could not support the French-controlled regime, Maistre departed again, this time for [[Lausanne]], Switzerland,<ref>Bordeaux, Henri (1895). "Joseph de Maistre à Genève et à Lausanne".

("Five Paradoxes for the Marchioness of Nav...", 1795).<ref name=berlin/>

From Lausanne, Maistre went to [[Venice]] and then to [[Cagliari]], where the King of Piedmont-Sardinia held the court and the government of the kingdom after French armies took Turin in 1798. Maistre's relations with the court at Cagliari were not always easy.<ref name=berlin/> In 1802, he was sent to [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia as ambassador to [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]].<ref>Teeling, T.T. (1985). [https://archive.org/stream/americancatholic20philuoft#page/806/mode/2up "Joseph de Maistre,"] ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review'', Vol. XX, p. 824.</ref> His diplomatic responsibilities were few and he became a well-loved fixture in aristocratic and wealthy merchant circles, converting some of his friends to Roman Catholicism and writing his most influential works on political philosophy.

Maistre's observations on Russian life, contained in his diplomatic memoirs and in his personal correspondence, were among [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s sources for his novel ''[[War and Peace]]''.<ref name=berlin/> After the defeat of [[Napoleon]] and the restoration of the House of Savoy's dominion over [[Piedmont]] and Savoy under the terms of the [[Congress of Vienna]], Maistre returned in 1817 to Turin and served there as [[magistrate]] and minister of state until his death. He died on 26 February 1821 and is buried in the Jesuit Church of the Holy Martyrs (''Chiesa dei Santi Martiri'').

== Philosophy ==
=== Politics ===
{{Conservatism in France|Intellectuals}}
In {{lang|fr|[[Considerations on France|Considérations sur la France]]}} ("Considerations on France", 1796), Maistre claimed that France has a divine mission as the principal instrument of good and evil on Earth. He interpreted the Revolution of 1789 as a [[Divine providence|providential]] event in which the [[monarchy]], the [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocracy]] and the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' in general, instead of directing the influence of French civilization to the benefit of mankind, had promoted the [[atheistic]] doctrines of the 18th-century philosophers. He claimed that the crimes of the [[Reign of Terror]] were the [[logical consequence]] of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought as well as its divinely-decreed punishment.<ref name= HCaR>{{cite journal |last=Lebrun |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Lebrun |date=1967 |title=Joseph de Maistre, how Catholic a Reaction? |url=http://umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1967/Lebrun.pdf |journal=CCHA Study Sessions |volume=34 |issue= |pages=29–45 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070107035631/http://umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1967/Lebrun.pdf |archive-date=2007-01-07}}</ref>

In his short book ''Essai sur le Principe Générateur des Constitutions Politiques et des Autres Institutions Humaines'' ("Essay on the Generative Principle of Political Constitutions and other Human Institutions", 1809), Maistre argued that [[constitution]]s are not the product of [[human reason]], but rather come from [[God]], who slowly brings them to maturity.

What was novel in Maistre's writings was not his enthusiastic defense of monarchical and religious authority ''per se'', but rather his arguments concerning the practical need for ultimate authority to lie with an individual capable of decisive action as well as his analysis of the social foundations of that authority's legitimacy. In his own words which he addressed to a group of aristocratic French émigrés, "You ought to know how to be royalists. Before, this was an instinct, but today it is a science. You must love the sovereign as you love order, with all the forces of intelligence."<ref name="Sénart">Quoted by Philippe Sénart in [https://books.google.com/books?id=kiDaH4ll41oC&pg=PA646 "Maistre et Tocqueville"], ''Joseph de Maistre. Les Dossiers H'', (Lausanne: Editions L'Age d'Homme, 2005), p. 646.  {{ISBN|2825118710}}</ref> Maistre's analysis of the problem of authority and its legitimacy foreshadows some of the concerns of early sociologists such as [[Auguste Comte]]<ref>Barth, Hans (1956).

Despite his preference for monarchy, Maistre acknowledged that republics could be the superior form of government, depending on the situation and the people. Maistre also defended the government of the [[United States]] because its people were heirs to the democratic spirit of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], which he felt France lacked.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Murray |first=John C |date=1949 |title=The Political Thought of Joseph De Maistre|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1404500.|journal= The Review of Politics |volume=11 |issue=1 |page=75, 78-79|doi=10.1017/S0034670500044685 |jstor=1404500 }}</ref>

=== Religion ===
After the appearance in 1816 of his French translation of [[Plutarch]]'s treatise ''On the Delay of Divine Justice in the Punishment of the Guilty'', Maistre published ''Du Pape'' ("[[On the Pope]]") in 1819, the most complete exposition of his religious conception of authority. According to Maistre, any attempt to justify government on rational grounds will only lead to unresolvable arguments about the legitimacy and expediency of any existing government and that this in turn will lead to violence and chaos.<ref>Murray, John C. (1949). "The Political Thought of Joseph de Maistre," ''The Review of Politics'', Vol. 11, No. 1, pp. 63–86.</ref><ref>Bradley, Owen (1999). ''A Modern Maistre: The Social and Political Thought of Joseph de Maistre''. Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press.</ref> As a result, Maistre argued that the legitimacy of government must be based on compelling, but non-rational grounds which its subjects must not be allowed to question.<ref>Lebrun, Richard A. (1969). "Joseph de Maistre, Cassandra of Science," ''French Historical Studies'', Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 214–231.</ref> Maistre went on to argue that [[authority]] in politics should derive from religion and that in Europe this religious authority must ultimately lie with the [[Pope]].

=== Ethics ===
{{Theodicy}}
In addition to his voluminous correspondence, Maistre left two books that were published posthumously. ''[[St Petersburg Dialogues|Soirées de St. Pétersbourg]]'' (1821) is a [[theodicy]] in the form of a [[Plato#Plato's dialogues|Platonic dialogue]]<ref>Kochin, Michael S. (2002). [http://www.tau.ac.il/~kochin/maislawsfinal.pdf "How Joseph De Maistre Read Plato's Laws,"] ''Polis'', Vol. 19, Nos. 1–2, pp. 29–43.</ref> in which Maistre argues that evil exists because of its place in the divine plan, according to which the blood sacrifice of innocents returns men to God via the expiation of the sins of the guilty. Maistre sees this as a law of human history as unquestionable as it is mysterious.

=== Science ===

Together with the [[Anglo-Irish]] statesman and philosopher [[Edmund Burke]], Maistre is commonly regarded as one of the founders of European [[conservatism]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Conservatism : The Fight for a Tradition|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9780691207773|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=2020|isbn=978-0-691-20777-3|first=Edmund|last=Fawcett|pages=3–18|doi=10.1515/9780691207773 }}</ref><ref>Fuchs, Michel (1984).

Literary critic [[Émile Faguet]] described Maistre as "a fierce absolutist, a furious theocrat, an intransigent legitimist, apostle of a monstrous trinity composed of pope, king and hangman, always and everywhere the champion of the hardest, narrowest and most inflexible dogmatism, a dark figure out of the Middle Ages, part learned doctor, part inquisitor, part executioner".<ref>Émile Faguet, ''Politiques et Moralistes du Dix-neuvieme Siècle'', 1st series, Paris: Société Française d'Imprimerie et de Librairie, 1899.

=== Literature ===
Maistre's skills as a writer and polemicist ensured that he continues to be read. [[Matthew Arnold]], an influential 19th-century critic, wrote as follows while comparing Maistre's style with that of his Irish counterpart [[Edmund Burke]]:

<blockquote>"Joseph de Maistre is another of those men whose word, like that of Burke, has vitality. In imaginative power he is altogether inferior to Burke. On the other hand, his thought moves in closer order than Burke's, more rapidly, more directly; he has fewer superfluities. Burke is a great writer, but Joseph de Maistre's use of the French language is more powerful, more thoroughly satisfactory, than Burke's use of the English. It is masterly; it shows us to perfection of what that admirable instrument, the French language, is capable."<ref>Arnold, Matthew (1973). "Joseph de Maistre on Russia." In: ''English Literature and Irish Politics.'' Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, p. 87.</ref></blockquote>

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' of 1910 describes his writing style as "strong, lively, picturesque" and states that his "animation and good humour temper his dogmatic tone".<ref name=cath/> [[George Saintsbury]] called him "unquestionably one of the greatest thinkers and writers of the eighteenth century".<ref>Saintsbury, George (1917). [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433043675325;view=1up;seq=5 ''A Short History of French Literature.''] Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 469.</ref> Although a political opponent, [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] called him the "[[Plato]] of the Alps".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Murray |first=John C |date=1949 |title=The Political Thought of Joseph De Maistre|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1404500.|journal= The Review of Politics |volume=11 |issue=1 |page=67|doi=10.1017/S0034670500044685 |jstor=1404500 }}</ref> Admiring the splendour of his prose, Lamartine stated:

{{blockquote|"That brief, nervous, lucid style, stripped of phrases, robust of limb, did not at all recall the softness of the eighteenth century, nor the declamations of the latest French books: it was born and steeped in the breath of the Alps; it was virgin, it was young, it was harsh and savage; it had no human respect, it felt its solitude; it improvised depth and form all at once ...
