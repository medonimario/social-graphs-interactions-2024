His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as [[special relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. Many physicists regard Maxwell as the 19th-century scientist having the greatest influence on 20th-century physics.

Maxwell's parents met and married when they were well into their thirties;<ref>{{Cite book|title=James Clerk Maxwell: a biography|last=Tolstoy|first=Ivan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1981|isbn=0-226-80785-1|location=Chicago|page=11|oclc=8688302}}</ref> his mother was nearly 40 when he was born. They had had one earlier child, a daughter named Elizabeth, who died in infancy.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|p=1}}</ref>

When Maxwell was young his family moved to [[Glenlair House|Glenlair]], in Kirkcudbrightshire, which his parents had built on the estate which comprised {{convert|1500|acre|ha}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|pp=186–187}}</ref> All indications suggest that Maxwell had maintained an unquenchable curiosity from an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|title=James Clerk Maxwell: a biography|last=Tolstoy|first=Ivan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1981|isbn=0-226-80785-1|location=Chicago|page=13|oclc=8688302}}</ref> By the age of three, everything that moved, shone, or made a noise drew the question: "what's the go o' that?"<ref>{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=3}}</ref> In a passage added to a letter from his father to his sister-in-law Jane Cay in 1834, his mother described this innate sense of inquisitiveness:
{{Blockquote|He is a very happy man, and has improved much since the weather got moderate; he has great work with doors, locks, keys, etc., and "show me how it doos" is never out of his mouth.

===Education, 1839–1847===
Recognising the boy's potential, Maxwell's mother Frances took responsibility for his early education, which in the [[Victorian times|Victorian era]] was largely the job of the woman of the house.<ref name=":0" /> At eight he could recite long passages of [[John Milton]] and the whole of the [[Psalm 119|119th psalm]] (176 verses). Indeed, his knowledge of [[Religious text|scripture]] was already detailed; he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from the Psalms. His mother was taken ill with [[abdominal cancer]] and, after an unsuccessful operation, died in December 1839 when he was eight years old. His education was then overseen by his father and his father's sister-in-law Jane, both of whom played pivotal roles in his life.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=James Clerk Maxwell : a biography|last=Tolstoy|first=Ivan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1981|isbn=0-226-80785-1|location=Chicago|pages=15–16|oclc=8688302}}</ref> His formal schooling began unsuccessfully under the guidance of a 16-year-old hired tutor. Little is known about the young man hired to instruct Maxwell, except that he treated the younger boy harshly, chiding him for being slow and wayward.<ref name=":0" /> The tutor was dismissed in November 1841. James' father took him to [[Robert Davidson (inventor)|Robert Davidson]]'s demonstration of electric propulsion and magnetic force on 12 February 1842, an experience with profound implications for the boy.<ref>Anthony F.

Maxwell was sent to the prestigious [[Edinburgh Academy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|pp=19–21}}</ref> He lodged during term times at the house of his aunt Isabella. During this time his passion for drawing was encouraged by his older cousin Jemima.<ref name="mahon_p 12-14">{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|pp=12–14}}</ref> The 10-year-old Maxwell, having been raised in isolation on his father's countryside estate, did not fit in well at school.<ref name="mahon_p 10">{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=10}}</ref> The first year had been full, obliging him to join the second year with classmates a year his senior.<ref name="mahon_p 10"/> His mannerisms and [[Galloway]] accent struck the other boys as rustic. Having arrived on his first day of school wearing a pair of homemade shoes and a tunic, he earned the unkind nickname of "[[wikt:daft|Daftie]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=4}}</ref> He never seemed to resent the epithet, bearing it without complaint for many years.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|pp=23–24}}</ref> Social isolation at the Academy ended when he met [[Lewis Campbell (classicist)|Lewis Campbell]] and [[Peter Guthrie Tait]], two boys of a similar age who were to become notable scholars later in life. They remained lifelong friends.<ref name="oxford_506"/>

Maxwell was fascinated by [[geometry]] at an early age, rediscovering the [[regular polyhedra]] before he received any formal instruction.<ref name="mahon_p 12-14"/> Despite his winning the school's scripture biography prize in his second year, his academic work remained unnoticed<ref name="mahon_p 12-14"/> until, at the age of 13, he won the school's mathematical medal and first prize for both English and poetry.<ref name="Campbell, p 43">{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|p=43}}</ref>

Maxwell's interests ranged far beyond the school syllabus and he did not pay particular attention to examination performance.<ref name="Campbell, p 43"/> He wrote his first [[scientific paper]] at the age of 14. In it, he described a mechanical means of drawing [[Curve|mathematical curves]] with a piece of twine, and the properties of [[ellipse]]s, [[Cartesian ovals]], and related curves with more than two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]]. The work,<ref name="oxford_506"/><ref name="gardner"/> of 1846, "On the description of oval curves and those having a plurality of foci"<ref>{{cite web |title=Key dates in the life of James Clerk Maxwell |url=http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/html/key_facts_about_maxwell.html |website=[[James Clerk Maxwell Foundation]] |publisher=www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/ |access-date=2023-12-08|archive-date=5 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200305045153/http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/html/key_facts_about_maxwell.html |url-status=live }}</ref> was presented to the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] by [[James David Forbes|James Forbes]], a professor of [[natural philosophy]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]],<ref name="oxford_506"/><ref name="gardner">{{harvnb|Gardner|2007|pp=46–49}}</ref> because Maxwell was deemed too young to present the work himself.<ref name="Mahon_2003_p_16">{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=16}}</ref> The work was not entirely original, since [[René Descartes]] had also examined the properties of such [[multifocal ellipse]]s in the 17th century, but Maxwell had simplified their construction.<ref name="Mahon_2003_p_16"/>

===University of Edinburgh, 1847–1850===
[[File:Edinburgh University 1827.jpg|left|thumb|Old College, University of Edinburgh]]

Maxwell left the Academy in 1847 at age 16 and began attending classes at the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref name="Harman_p 662">{{harvnb|Harman|2004|p=662}}</ref> He had the opportunity to attend the [[University of Cambridge]], but decided, after his first term, to complete the full course of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of the university included some highly regarded names; his first-year tutors included [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]], who lectured him on [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]], [[Philip Kelland]] on mathematics, and [[James David Forbes|James Forbes]] on [[natural philosophy]].<ref name="oxford_506"/> He did not find his classes demanding,<ref>{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|p=46}}</ref> and was, therefore, able to immerse himself in private study during free time at the university and particularly when back home at Glenlair.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|p=64}}</ref> There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus; however, his chief concerns regarded the properties of [[polarized light|polarised light]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|pp=30–31}}</ref> He constructed shaped blocks of [[gelatine]], subjected them to various [[stress (physics)|stresses]], and with a pair of [[Nicol prism|polarising prisms]] given to him by [[William Nicol (inventor)|William Nicol]], viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly.<ref>{{harvnb|Timoshenko|1983|p=58}}</ref> Through this practice he discovered [[photoelasticity]], which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures.<ref>{{harvnb|Russo|1996|p=73}}</ref>

At age 18, Maxwell contributed two papers for the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. One of these, "On the Equilibrium of Elastic Solids", laid the foundation for an important discovery later in his life, which was the temporary [[double refraction]] produced in [[viscosity|viscous]] liquids by [[shear stress]].<ref>{{harvnb|Timoshenko|1983|pp=268–278}}</ref> His other paper was "Rolling Curves" and, just as with the paper "Oval Curves" that he had written at the Edinburgh Academy, he was again considered too young to stand at the rostrum to present it himself. The paper was delivered to the Royal Society by his tutor Kelland instead.<ref>{{harvnb|Glazebrook|1896|p=23}}</ref>

===University of Cambridge, 1850–1856===
[[File:YoungJamesClerkMaxwell.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A young Maxwell at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], holding one of his [[colour wheel]]s]]

In October 1850, already an accomplished mathematician, Maxwell left Scotland for the [[University of Cambridge]]. He initially attended [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]], but before the end of his first term transferred to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]], where he believed it would be easier to obtain a [[fellow]]ship.<ref>{{harvnb|Glazebrook|1896|p=28}}</ref> At Trinity he was elected to the elite secret society known as the [[Cambridge Apostles]].<ref>{{harvnb|Glazebrook|1896|p=30}}</ref> Maxwell's intellectual understanding of his Christian faith and of science grew rapidly during his Cambridge years. He joined the "Apostles", an exclusive debating society of the intellectual elite, where through his essays he sought to work out this understanding.

{{blockquote|Now my great plan, which was conceived of old, ... is to let nothing be wilfully left unexamined. Nothing is to be holy ground consecrated to Stationary Faith, whether positive or negative. All fallow land is to be ploughed up and a regular system of rotation followed. ... Never hide anything, be it weed or no, nor seem to wish it hidden. ... Again I assert the Right of Trespass on any plot of Holy Ground which any man has set apart. ... Now I am convinced that no one but a Christian can actually purge his land of these holy spots. ... I do not say that no Christians have enclosed places of this sort. Many have a great deal, and every one has some. But there are extensive and important tracts in the territory of the Scoffer, the Pantheist, the Quietist, Formalist, Dogmatist, Sensualist, and the rest, which are openly and solemnly Tabooed. ..."

Christianity—that is, the religion of the Bible—is the only scheme or form of belief which disavows any possessions on such a tenure. Here alone all is free.

In the summer of his third year, Maxwell spent some time at the [[Otley, Suffolk|Suffolk]] home of the Rev. [[Charles Benjamin Tayler|C. B. Tayler]], the uncle of a classmate, G. W. H. Tayler. The love of God shown by the family impressed Maxwell, particularly after he was nursed back from ill health by the minister and his wife.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|1882|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8_iS-4ec9wwC&pg=PA170 169–170]}}</ref>

On his return to Cambridge, Maxwell writes to his recent host a chatty and affectionate letter including the following testimony,<ref name="MIT IAP Seminar"/>

In November 1851, Maxwell studied under [[William Hopkins]], whose success in nurturing mathematical genius had earned him the nickname of "[[Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|senior wrangler]]-maker".<ref>{{harvnb|Warwick|2003|pp=84–85}}</ref>

In 1854, Maxwell graduated from Trinity with a degree in mathematics. He scored second highest in the final examination, coming behind [[Edward Routh]] and earning himself the title of Second Wrangler. He was later declared equal with Routh in the more exacting ordeal of the [[Smith's Prize]] examination.<ref name="Tolstoy_p 62">{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|p=62}}</ref> Immediately after earning his degree, Maxwell read his paper "On the Transformation of Surfaces by Bending" to the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harman|1998|p=3}}</ref> This is one of the few purely mathematical papers he had written, demonstrating his growing stature as a mathematician.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|p=61}}</ref> Maxwell decided to remain at Trinity after graduating and applied for a fellowship, which was a process that he could expect to take a couple of years.<ref name="Mahon_p 47-48">{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|pp=47–48}}</ref> Buoyed by his success as a research student, he would be free, apart from some tutoring and examining duties, to pursue scientific interests at his own leisure.<ref name="Mahon_p 47-48"/>

[[File:Saturn HST 2004-03-22.jpg|thumb|Maxwell proved that the [[rings of Saturn]] were made of numerous small particles.]]
The 25-year-old Maxwell was a good 15 years younger than any other professor at Marischal. He engaged himself with his new responsibilities as head of a department, devising the syllabus and preparing lectures.<ref name="Mahon_p 69-71">{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|pp=69–71}}</ref> He committed himself to lecturing 15 hours a week, including a weekly ''[[pro bono]]'' lecture to the local working men's college.<ref name="Mahon_p 69-71"/> He lived in Aberdeen with his cousin [[William Dyce Cay]], a Scottish civil engineer, during the six months of the academic year and spent the summers at Glenlair, which he had inherited from his father.<ref name="preface"/>

Later, his former student described Maxwell as follows:
<blockquote>In the late 1850s shortly before 9 am any winter’s morning you might well have seen the young James Clerk Maxwell, in his mid to late 20s, a man of middling height, with frame strongly knit, and a certain spring and elasticity in his gait; dressed for comfortable ease rather than elegance; a face expressive at once of sagacity and good humour, but overlaid with a deep shade of thoughtfulness; features boldly put pleasingly marked; eyes dark and glowing; hair and beard perfectly black, and forming a strong contrast to the pallor of his complexion.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Reid |first1=John S. |title=James Clerk Maxwell plaque – 129 Union Street |url=https://studylib.net/doc/18046724/james-clerk-maxwell-plaque-%E2%80%93-129-union-street |publisher=The Scientific Tourist: Aberdeen}}</ref></blockquote>

[[File:James Clark Maxwell and his wife by Jemima Blackburn.jpg|thumb|left|James Clerk Maxwell and his wife, painted by [[Jemima Blackburn]]]]
He focused his attention on a problem that had eluded scientists for 200 years: the nature of [[Rings of Saturn|Saturn's rings]]. It was unknown how they could remain stable without breaking up, drifting away or crashing into Saturn.<ref>{{harvnb|Harman|1998|pp=48–53}}</ref> The problem took on a particular resonance at that time because [[St John's College, Cambridge]], had chosen it as the topic for the 1857 [[Adams Prize]].<ref name="oxford_508">{{harvnb|Harman|2004|p=508}}</ref> Maxwell devoted two years to studying the problem, proving that a regular solid ring could not be stable, while a fluid ring would be forced by wave action to break up into blobs. Since neither was observed, he concluded that the rings must be composed of numerous small particles he called "brick-bats", each independently orbiting Saturn.<ref name="oxford_508"/> Maxwell was awarded the £130 Adams Prize in 1859 for his essay "On the stability of the motion of Saturn's rings";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/onstabilityofmot00maxw |title=On the stability of the motion of Saturn's rings |access-date=24 March 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616221114/https://archive.org/details/onstabilityofmot00maxw |archive-date=16 June 2015 }}</ref> he was the only entrant to have made enough headway to submit an entry.<ref>{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=75}}</ref> His work was so detailed and convincing that when [[George Biddell Airy]] read it he commented, "It is one of the most remarkable applications of mathematics to physics that I have ever seen."<ref name=mactutor/> It was considered the final word on the issue until direct observations by the ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' flybys of the 1980s confirmed Maxwell's prediction that the rings were composed of particles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/scientists/biographies/james-clerk-maxwell/index.html |title=James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) |publisher=National Library of Scotland |access-date=27 August 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006063943/http://digital.nls.uk/scientists/biographies/james-clerk-maxwell/index.html |archive-date=6 October 2013 }}</ref>  It is now understood, however, that the rings' particles are not totally stable, being pulled by gravity onto Saturn.

In 1857 Maxwell befriended the Reverend Daniel Dewar, who was then the Principal of Marischal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I20494&ged=auden-bicknell.ged |title=Very Rev.

They were engaged in February 1858 and married in Aberdeen on 2 June 1858. On the marriage record, Maxwell is listed as Professor of Natural Philosophy in Marischal College, Aberdeen.<ref>James Clerk Maxwell and Katherine Mary Dewar marriage certificate, Family History Library film #280176, district 168/2 (Old Machar, Aberdeen), page 83, certificate No. 65.</ref> Katherine was seven years Maxwell's senior. Comparatively little is known of her, although it is known that she helped in his lab and worked on experiments in [[viscosity]].<ref>{{harvnb|Maxwell|2001|p=351}}</ref> Maxwell's biographer and friend, Lewis Campbell, adopted an uncharacteristic reticence on the subject of Katherine, though describing their married life as "one of unexampled devotion".<ref>{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|pp=88–91}}</ref>

In 1860 Marischal College merged with the neighbouring [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] to form the [[University of Aberdeen]]. There was no room for two professors of Natural Philosophy, so Maxwell, despite his scientific reputation, found himself laid off. He was unsuccessful in applying for Forbes's recently vacated chair at Edinburgh, the post instead going to [[Peter Tait (physicist)|Tait]]. Maxwell was granted the Chair of Natural Philosophy at [[King's College, London]], instead.<ref name="Glazebrook_p 54">{{harvnb|Glazebrook|1896|p=54}}</ref> After recovering from a near-fatal bout of [[smallpox]] in 1860, he moved to London with his wife.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|p=98}}</ref>

===King's College, London, 1860–1865===

Maxwell's time at King's was probably the most productive of his career. He was awarded the [[Royal Society|Royal Society's]] [[Rumford Medal]] in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861.<ref name="Tolstoy_p 103-104">{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|p=103}}</ref> This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the [[viscosity]] of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities—now known as [[dimensional analysis]]. Maxwell would often attend lectures at the [[Royal Institution]], where he came into regular contact with [[Michael Faraday]]. The relationship between the two men could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40&nbsp;years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of [[senility]]. They nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other's talents.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolstoy|1982|pp=100–101}}</ref>

This time is especially noteworthy for the advances Maxwell made in the fields of electricity and magnetism. He examined the nature of both electric and magnetic fields in his two-part paper "[[On physical lines of force]]", which was published in 1861. In it, he provided a conceptual model for [[electromagnetic induction]], consisting of tiny spinning cells of [[magnetic flux]]. Two more parts were later added to and published in that same paper in early 1862. In the first additional part, he discussed the nature of [[electrostatics]] and [[displacement current]]. In the second additional part, he dealt with the rotation of the plane of the [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation of light]] in a magnetic field, a phenomenon that had been discovered by Faraday and is now known as the [[Faraday effect]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=109}}</ref>

In 1865 Maxwell resigned the chair at King's College, London, and returned to Glenlair with Katherine. In his paper "On governors" (1868) he mathematically described the behaviour of [[governor (device)|governors]]—devices that control the speed of steam engines—thereby establishing the theoretical basis of control engineering.<ref>Maxwell, J.C.

As death approached Maxwell told a Cambridge colleague,<ref name="MIT IAP Seminar"/>

Maxwell wrote the following aphorism for his own conduct as a scientist: <blockquote>He that would enjoy life and act with freedom must have the work of the day continually before his eyes. Not yesterday's work, lest he fall into despair, not to-morrow's, lest he become a visionary not that which ends with the day, which is a worldly work, nor yet that only which remains to eternity, for by it he cannot shape his action.

[[File:Postcard-from-Maxwell-to-Tait.jpg|thumb|left|A postcard from Maxwell to [[Peter Guthrie Tait|Peter Tait]]]]
Maxwell had studied and commented on electricity and magnetism as early as 1855 when his paper "On Faraday's lines of force" was read to the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/39568221/maxwell-on-faraday-s-lines-of-force |title=On Faraday's Lines of Force |last1=Maxwell |first1=James Clerk |year=1855 |work=Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |publisher=blazelabs.com |access-date=27 March 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317170056/http://www.scribd.com/doc/39568221/maxwell-on-faraday-s-lines-of-force |archive-date=17 March 2014 }}</ref> The paper presented a simplified model of Faraday's work and how electricity and magnetism are related. He reduced all of the current knowledge into a linked set of [[differential equation]]s with 20 equations in 20 variables. This work was later published as "[[On Physical Lines of Force]]" in March 1861.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2011/04Apr/JamesClerkMaxwell.aspx |title=1861: James Clerk Maxwell's greatest year |date=18 April 2011 |publisher=King's College London |access-date=28 March 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622095747/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2011/04Apr/JamesClerkMaxwell.aspx |archive-date=22 June 2013 }}</ref>

Around 1862, while lecturing at King's College, Maxwell calculated that the speed of propagation of an electromagnetic field is approximately that of the [[speed of light]]. He considered this to be more than just a coincidence, commenting, "We can scarcely avoid the conclusion that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.<ref name="mactutor"/>

Working on the problem further, Maxwell showed that the [[Electromagnetic wave equation|equations]] predict the existence of waves of [[electromagnetic radiation|oscillating electric and magnetic fields]] that travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments; using the data available at the time, Maxwell obtained a velocity of {{convert|310740000|m/s}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen3410/ECEN3410-FirstClass.pdf |title=ECEN3410 Electromagnetic Waves |publisher=University of Colorado |access-date=30 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317170802/http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen3410/ECEN3410-FirstClass.pdf |archive-date=17 March 2014  }}</ref> In his 1865 paper "[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]", Maxwell wrote, "The agreement of the results seems to show that light and magnetism are affections of the same substance, and that light is an electromagnetic disturbance propagated through the field according to electromagnetic laws".<ref name=ADTEF/>

As Barrett and Grimes (1995) describe:<ref>{{harvnb|Barrett|Grimes|1995|pp=7–8}}</ref>
<blockquote>Maxwell expressed electromagnetism in the algebra of [[quaternions]] and made the electromagnetic potential the centerpiece of his theory. In 1881 Heaviside replaced the electromagnetic potential field by force fields as the centerpiece of electromagnetic theory. According to Heaviside, the electromagnetic potential field was arbitrary and needed to be "assassinated". (''sic'') A few years later there was a debate between Heaviside and [[Peter Guthrie Tait|[Peter Guthrie] Tate]] (''sic'') about the relative merits of [[vector analysis]] and [[quaternions]]. The result was the realization that there was no need for the greater physical insights provided by [[quaternions]] if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. </blockquote>

Maxwell was proved correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th-century [[mathematical physics]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6shu_hAiGkC&pg=PA86 |page=86 |title=Dot-Dash to Dot.Com: How Modern Telecommunications Evolved from the Telegraph to the Internet |isbn=978-1-4419-6760-2 |last=Wheen |first=Andrew |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617122830/https://books.google.com/books?id=B6shu_hAiGkC&pg=PA86 |archive-date=17 June 2016 }}</ref>

===Colour vision===
[[File:Tartan Ribbon.jpg|thumb|First durable colour photographic image, demonstrated by Maxwell in an 1861 lecture]]

Along with most physicists of the time, Maxwell had a strong interest in psychology. Following in the steps of [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], he was particularly interested in the study of [[colour vision]]. From 1855 to 1872, Maxwell published at intervals a series of investigations concerning the perception of colour, [[colour-blindness]], and colour theory, and was awarded the [[Rumford Medal]] for "On the Theory of Colour Vision".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Projects/Johnson/Chapters/Ch4_2.html |title=Colour Vision |publisher=University of St Andrews |author=Johnson, Kevin |date=May 2012 |access-date=20 May 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111044045/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Projects/Johnson/Chapters/Ch4_2.html |archive-date=11 November 2012 }}</ref>

[[Isaac Newton]] had demonstrated, using prisms, that white light, such as [[sunlight]], is composed of a number of [[Spectral color|monochromatic components]] which could then be recombined into white light.<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton |first=Isaac |date=1704 |title=Opticks: or a treatise of the reflexions, refractions, inflexions and colours of light |url=https://archive.org/details/opticksortreatisnewt |location=London |publisher=Printed for Sam.

Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called ''[[Metamerism (color)|metameres]]''. [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Young |first=Thomas |title=Bakerian Lecture: Experiments and calculations relative to physical optics |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |year=1804 |volume=94 |pages=1–16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7AZGAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1 |bibcode=1804RSPT...94....1Y |doi=10.1098/rstl.1804.0001 |s2cid=110408369 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427130034/https://books.google.com/books?id=7AZGAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1 |archive-date=27 April 2016 |doi-access=free }}</ref> the ''[[Young–Helmholtz theory|trichromatic colour theory]]''. Maxwell used the recently developed [[linear algebra]] to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |date=1857 |title=XVIII.—Experiments on Colour, as perceived by the Eye, with Remarks on Colour-Blindness |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |publisher=Royal Society of Edinburgh |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=275–298 |doi=10.1017/S0080456800032117 |s2cid=123930770 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/2041790 |access-date=10 March 2020 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801221025/https://zenodo.org/record/2041790 |url-status=live }}</ref> inventing colour matching experiments and [[Colourimetry]].

Maxwell was also interested in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in [[colour photography]]. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced with a set of three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through [[RGB color model|red, green, and blue]] [[filter (optics)|filters]], and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maxwell |first1=James Clerk |year=1855 |title=Experiments on Colour, as Perceived by the Eye, with Remarks on Colour-Blindness |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=275–298 |doi=10.1017/S0080456800032117 |s2cid=123930770 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/2041790 |access-date=10 March 2020 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801221025/https://zenodo.org/record/2041790 |url-status=live }} (This thought-experiment is described on pages 283–284. The short-wavelength filter is specified as "violet", but during the 19th century "violet" could be used to describe a deep violet-blue such as the colour of cobalt glass.)</ref>

During an 1861 Royal Institution lecture on colour theory, Maxwell presented the world's first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]], inventor of the [[single-lens reflex camera]], took the picture. He photographed a [[tartan]] ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter, which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's [[photographic plate]]s were insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, the results of this pioneering experiment were far from perfect. It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that "if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue", it "would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved."<ref name="Tolstoy_p 103-104"/><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://notesonphotographs.org/index.php?title=Maxwell,_J._Clerk._%22On_the_Theory_of_Three_Primary_Colours.%22|author=Maxwell, J.

Maxwell also investigated the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases. Originating with [[Daniel Bernoulli]], this theory was advanced by the successive labours of [[John Herapath]], [[John James Waterston]], [[James Prescott Joule|James Joule]], and particularly [[Rudolf Clausius]], to such an extent as to put its general accuracy beyond a doubt; but it received enormous development from Maxwell, who in this field appeared as an experimenter (on the laws of gaseous friction) as well as a mathematician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theiet.org/resources/library/archives/biographies/maxwell.cfm |title=Archives Biographies: James Clerk Maxwell |publisher=The Institution of Engineering and Technology |access-date=1 July 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627090441/http://www.theiet.org/resources/library/archives/biographies/maxwell.cfm |archive-date=27 June 2013 }}</ref>

His work on [[thermodynamics]] led him to devise the [[thought experiment]] that came to be known as [[Maxwell's demon]], where the [[second law of thermodynamics]] is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Merali|first1=Zeeya|title=Demonic device converts information to energy|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101114/full/news.2010.606.html|work=Nature News|date=14 November 2010|language=en|doi=10.1038/news.2010.606|access-date=5 August 2017|archive-date=19 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819040059/http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101114/full/news.2010.606.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1871, he established [[Maxwell relations|Maxwell's thermodynamic relations]], which are statements of equality among the second derivatives of the [[thermodynamic potentials]] with respect to different thermodynamic variables.
