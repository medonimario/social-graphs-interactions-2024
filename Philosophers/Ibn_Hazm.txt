<!-- In various sources Ibn Hazm is described as Atharite, and in other sources as an independent theologian who critiqued Asharite school, but with views that diverged from Atharism. Based on this, it is more appropriate to categorise Ibn Hazm simply as an independent Zahirite/Literalist theologian. --><!-- According to, "Kılavuz, Ulvi Murat. "İbn Hazm'da Nübüvvet Tasavvuru." Review of the Faculty of Theology of Uludag University 24.1 (2015).", Ibn Hazm does not belong to any particular school, representing Sunni theology generally. Kılavuz' work is dedicated to Ibn Hazm's theology and so his view is preferred over the passing remark of Halverson that he follows the Hanbalite/Athari tradition.

Other sources state that he repudiated the Ash'aris although sources such as, "Friedlaender, Israel. "The Heterodoxies of the Shiites in the Presentation of Ibn Hazm." Journal of the American Oriental Society 29 (1908): 1-183." state that this is based off of a misrepresentation of their theology.

Abrahamov, in "Abrahamov, Binyamin. "Necessary knowledge in Islamic theology." British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies 20.1 (1993): 20-32.", simply labels him a "Zahirite" Theologian - perhaps meaning a theologian in line with Dawud al-Zahiri's theological views (which, according to ad-Dhahabi in his Siyar, are in turn derived from Ibn Kullab.) Alternatively he intends a "literalist" theologian i.e. anthropomorphist.

But Makin, in "Makin, Al. "The Influence of Zāhirī Theory On Ibn Hazm's Theology: the Case of His Interpretation of the Anthropomorphic Text" the Hand of God"." Medieval encounters 5.1 (1999): 112-120." makes the case that he rejects such interpretations when it comes to theology.

We prefer then the view of Kilavuz as he in particular deals exclusively with Ibn Hazm and his theology, rather than given a passing remark discussing a broader subject. Thus his creed should not be added - he is neither an Athari, nor an Ash'ari etc.

Perhaps a section can be added to the article discussing all of this.-->

'''Ibn Hazm'''{{efn|Full name '''Abū Muḥammad ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad ibn Saʿīd ibn Ḥazm al-Andalusī''' ({{langx|ar|أَبُو مُحَمَّد عَلِيّ بْن أَحْمَد بْن سَعِيد بْن حَزْم ٱلْأَنْدَلُسِيّ}})}} ({{Langx|ar|ابن حزم|translit=Ibn Ḥazm}}; November 994 – 15 August 1064) was an Andalusian Muslim [[polymath]], [[historian]], [[muhaddith|traditionist]], [[faqīh|jurist]], [[philosopher]], and [[theologian]], born in the [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Córdoban Caliphate]], present-day [[Spain]].<ref name="EB2">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Fiegenbaum |first= J.W. |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ibn-Hazm |title=Ibn Ḥazm |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref> Described as one of the strictest [[hadith]] interpreters, Ibn Hazm was a leading proponent and codifier of the [[Zahiri school]] of [[Islam|Islamic]] [[fiqh|jurisprudence]],<ref name="brill" /> and produced a reported 400 works, of which only 40 still survive.<ref name="gulf">Joseph A.

==Personal life==
[[File:WarnerUBL.jpg|thumb|260px|right|The Ring of the Dove <br/>(Ms. Or. 927 in [[Leiden University Library]])]]

===Lineage===
Ibn Hazm's grandfather Sa'id and his father, Ahmad, both held high advisory positions in the court of [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph]] [[Hisham II]].<ref>The court was under the effective rule of the [[grand vizier]], [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir|al-Mansur]], and his successor and son, al-Muzaffar</ref> Scholars believe that they were Iberian Christians who converted to Islam (''[[Muwallad]]s'').<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ibn-Hazm/Encyclopaedia Britannica] "Ibn Ḥazm was born into a notable family that claimed descent from a Persian client of Yazīd, the son of Muʿāwiyah, the first of the Umayyad dynasty rulers in Syria. Muslim families of Iberian (Spanish) background commonly adopted genealogies that identified them with the Arabs; some scholars, therefore, tend to favor evidence suggesting that Ibn Ḥazm was a member of a family of Iberian Christian background from Manta Līsham (west of Sevilla)."</ref>

[[al-Dhahabi]] said:
"Ali Ibn Ahmad Ibn Saeed Ibn Hazm, known for his extensive knowledge and skills, hailed from Persian origin and later became an integral figure in Andalusia, specifically in Cordoba. His notable contributions and lineage are detailed in the respected historical text 'Siyar A'lam al-Nubala.'"<ref>Shamsuddeen al-Thahabi, ''Siyar A'lam al-Nubala,'' vol. 18, p. 184.</ref>

===Upbringing===
Having been raised in a politically and economically important family, Ibn Hazm mingled with people of power and influence all his life. He had access to levels of government by his adolescence that most people then would never know throughout their whole lives. Those experiences with government and politicians caused Ibn Hazm to develop a reluctant and even sad skepticism about human nature and the capacity of human beings to deceive and to oppress.<ref name=lois428>Lois A. Giffen, "Ibn Hazm and the Tawq al-Hamama. Taken from ''The Legacy of Muslim Spain'', p. 428, ed. [[Salma Jayyusi]]. [[Leiden]]: [[Brill Publishers]], 1994.</ref>

His reaction was to believe that there was no refuge or truth except with an infallible God and that with men resided only corruption. He was thus known for his cynicism regarding humanity and a strong respect for the principles of language and sincerity in communication.<ref name=brill/>

==Career==
Ibn Hazm lived among the circle of the ruling hierarchy of the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] government. His experiences produced an eager and observant attitude, and he gained an excellent education at Córdoba. 

After the death of the grand vizier, [[Abd al-Malik al-Muzaffar|al-Muzaffar]], in 1008, the Caliphate of Iberia became embroiled in a civil war that lasted until 1031 and resulted in the collapse of the central authority of Córdoba and the emergence of many smaller independent states, the [[taifa]]s.<ref name="EB2"/>

[[File:Majorca and Minorca by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Historic map of Majorca and Minorca by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] admiral [[Piri Reis]].]]

Ibn Hazm's father died in 1012. Ibn Hazm was frequently imprisoned as a suspected supporter of the Umayyads.<ref name=gulf/><ref name="EB2"/> By 1031, Ibn Hazm retreated to his family estate at Manta Lisham and had begun to express his activist convictions in the literary form.<ref name="EB2"/> He was a leading proponent and codifier of the [[Zahiri]] [[madhab|school of Islamic thought]],<ref name="brill" /> and he produced a reported 400 works, but only 40 still survive.<ref name=gulf/><ref name="EB2"/><ref>Camilla Adang, ''This Day I have Perfected Your Religion For You: A Zahiri Conception of Religious Authority, pg. 19. Taken from ''Speaking for Islam: Religious Authorities in Muslim Societies". Ed. [[Gudrun Krämer]] and [[Sabine Schmidtke]]. [[Leiden]]: [[Brill Publishers]], 2006.</ref> His political and religious opponents gained power after the collapse of the caliphate and so he accepted an offer of asylum from the governor of the island of [[Majorca]] in the 1040s. He continued to propagate the Zahiri School there before he returned to Andalusia.<ref name="Sharif">{{cite book|title=A History of Muslim Philosophy: With Short Accounts of Other Disciplines and the Modern Renaissance in Muslim Lands, Volume 2|last1=Sharif|first1=M.M.|year=2013|publisher=Adam|isbn=9788174352880|pages=280–284}}</ref>

Contemporaries coined the saying "the tongue of Ibn Hazm was a twin brother to the sword of [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|al-Hajjaj]]", an infamous 7th century general and governor of Iraq. Ibn Hazm became so frequently quoted that the phrase "Ibn Hazm said" became proverbial.<ref name="EB2"/>

As an [[Athari]],<ref name=Halverson>{{cite book|last=Halverson|first=Jeffry R.|title=Theology and Creed in Sunni Islam: The Muslim Brotherhood, Ash'arism, and Political Sunnism |date=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=22|isbn=9780230106581|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYzGAAAAQBAJ&q=hazm&pg=PP1|quote="Indeed, Ibn Hazm, who was an Athari scholar of the now extinct Zahirite school of law in Spain..."}}</ref> he opposed the allegorical interpretation of religious texts and preferred a [[grammatical]] and [[syntactical]] interpretation of the [[Qur'an]]. He granted cognitive legitimacy only to revelation and sensation, and he considered [[deductive reasoning]] insufficient in legal and religious matters. He rejected practices common among more orthodox schools such as [[istihsan|juristic discretion]].<ref name=shadow34>[[Bilal Orfali]], "In the Shadow of Arabic: The Centrality of Language to Arab Culture." Pg. 34. [[Brill Publishers]], 2011. Print.</ref> He was initially a follower of the [[Maliki]] school of law within [[Sunni Islam]], but he switched to the [[Shafi'i]] school at around the age of thirty. He finally settled with the Zahiri school.<ref name=lois428/><ref>Adang, "From Malikism to Shafi'ism to Zahirism: The Conversions of Ibn Hazm", p. 73-87. ''Conversions islamiques.

He studied the school's precepts and methods under Abu al-Khiyar al-Dawudi al-Zahiri of [[Santarém Municipality]] and was eventually promoted to the level of a teacher of the school himself.

Much of Ibn Hazm's substantial body of works,<ref name="hadithsunnah">{{cite web |title=USC-MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/scienceofhadith/asb2.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128185832/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/scienceofhadith/asb2.html |archive-date=28 November 2008 |access-date=12 September 2010 |publisher=Usc.edu}}</ref><ref name="Arberry">Ibn Hazm.

His surviving works, while criticised as repetitive, didactic and abrasive in style,<ref>Adang, ''Zahiri Conceptions'', p. 20.</ref> also show a fearless irreverence towards his academic critics and authorities.

Ibn Hazm wrote works on law and theology and over ten medical books. He called for science to be integrated into a standard curriculum. In ''Organization of the Sciences'', he diachronically defines educational fields as stages of progressive acquisition set over a five-year curriculum, from language and [[Tafsir|exegesis of the Qur'an]] to the life and physical sciences to a rationalistic theology.<ref>Francoise Micheau, "The scientific institutions in the medical Near East". Taken from ''Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Volume 3: Technology, Alchemy and Life Sciences'', p. 1008. Ed. Roshdi Rashed. London: Routledge, 1996. {{ISBN|0415124123}}</ref>

Apart from his rational works, Ibn Hazm's [[The Ring of the Dove]] (''Tawq al-hamamah)'' is considered a major work of Arabic literature from Al-Andalus.<ref>Stearns, Peter N. “Arabic Language and Literature.” In ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern World''. Oxford University Press, 2008.</ref> The manuscript of ''Ṭawq al-ḥamāma'' (MS Or. 927) is kept at [[Leiden University Libraries]] and is also available digitally. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1887.1/item:1567570  |title=Digital version of Ṭawq al-ḥamāma fī 'al-ulfa wa-al-ullīf - Or. 927 |publisher=[[Leiden University Libraries]] |hdl=1887.1/item:1567570 |access-date=11 April 2024}}</ref>

===''Detailed Critical Examination''===
In ''Fisal'' (''Detailed Critical Examination''), a treatise on [[Islamic science]] and [[kalam|theology]], Ibn Hazm promoted sense [[perception]] above subjectively flawed human [[reason]]. Recognizing the importance of reason, as the [[Qur'an]] itself invites [[introspection|reflection]], he argued that reflection to refer mainly to [[revelation]] and [[sense]] data since the principles of reason are themselves derived entirely from [[sense experience]]. He concludes that reason is not a faculty for independent [[research]] or [[discovery (observation)|discovery]], but that [[empirical evidence|sense perception]] should be used in its place, an idea that forms the basis of [[empiricism]].<ref>[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/hazm/ibnhazm.htm Ibn Hazm], ''Islamic Philosophy Online''.</ref>

===Jurisprudence===
Perhaps Ibn Hazm's most influential work in the Arabic, selections of which have been translated into English, is now ''The Muhalla'' (المحلى بالأثار), or ''The Adorned Treatise''. It is reported to be a summary of a much longer work, known as ''Al-Mujalla'' (المجلى). Its essential focus is on matters of jurisprudence or fiqh (فقه), but it also touches of matters of creed in its first chapter, ''Kitab al-Tawheed'' (كتاب التوحيد), whose focus is on credal matters related to monotheism and the fundamental principles of approach to divine texts. One of the main points that emerges from the masterpiece of jurisprudencial thought is that Ibn Hazm rejects analogical reasoning (qiyas قياس) in favor of direct reliance on the Quran, [[sunnah]], and [[ijma]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author-last = Abdallah | author-first = Fadel I. | title = Notes on Ibn Hazm's Rejection of Analogy (Qiyas) in Matters of Religious Law | journal = American Journal of Islam and Society | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | year = 1985 | page = 223 | url = https://www.ajis.org/index.php/ajiss/article/download/2915/2615/5366 | type = PDF }}</ref>

===Logic===
Ibn Hazm wrote the ''Scope of Logic'', which stressed on the importance of sense perception as a source of knowledge.<ref name="Iqbal">[[Muhammad Iqbal]], ''[[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]'', "The Spirit of Muslim Culture" ([[cf.]] [http://www.allamaiqbal.com/works/prose/english/reconstruction] and [http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/MI_RRTI/chapter_05.htm])</ref> He wrote that the "first sources of all human knowledge are the soundly used senses and the intuitions of [[reason]], combined with a correct understanding of a language". Ibn Hazm also criticized some of the more traditionalist theologians who were opposed to the use of [[logic]] and argued that the first generations of [[Muslims]] did not rely on logic. His response was that the early Muslims had witnessed the [[revelation]] directly, but later Muslims have been exposed to contrasting beliefs and so the use of logic is necessary to preserve the true teachings of [[Islam]].<ref name=Leaman>Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', pp. 107–109, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-05667-5}}.</ref> The work was first republished in Arabic by [[Ihsan Abbas]] in 1959 and most recently by [[Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri]] in 2007.<ref>Jose Miguel Puerta Vilchez, "Inventory of Ibn Hazm's Works". Taken from ''Ibn Hazm of Cordoba: The Life and Works of a Controversial Thinker'', pg. 743. Eds. Camilla Adang, Maribel Fierro and Sabine Schmidtke. Volume 103 of Handbook of Oriental Studies. Section 1 The Near and Middle East. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2012. {{ISBN|9789004234246}}</ref>

===Ethics===
In his book, ''In Pursuit of Virtue'', Ibn Hazm had urged his readers:
<blockquote>Do not use your energy except for a cause more noble than yourself. Such a cause cannot be found except in Almighty God Himself: to preach the truth, to defend womanhood, to repel humiliation which your creator has not imposed upon you, to help the oppressed. Anyone who uses his energy for the sake of the vanities of the world is like someone who exchanges gemstones for gravel.<ref>In Pursuit of Virtue, section under Treatment to be given to Souls, and the Reform of Vicious Characters, #9</ref></blockquote>

===Poetry===
A poem or fragment of a poem by him is preserved in [[Ibn Said al-Maghribi]]'s ''Pennants of the Champions'':<ref>{{cite book|last=Gómez|first=translated by [[Cola Franzen]] from the Spanish versions of Emilio García|title=Poems of Arab Andalusia|year=1989|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEHb0lmTvS8C&q=Poemas+ar%C3%A1bigoandaluces|isbn=978-0-87286-242-5}}</ref>
:::You came to me just before

:::The half-moon was rising
:::looking like an old man's eyebrow
:::or a delicate instep.

:::And although it was still night
:::when you came a rainbow
:::gleamed on the horizon,
:::showing as many colours
:::as a peacock's tail.

===Medicine===
Ibn Hazm's teachers in medicine included [[al-Zahrawi]] and [[Ibn al-Kattani]], and he wrote ten medical works,<ref>Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Oliver Leaman (ed.), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', Routledge, 2013, p. 945</ref> including ''Kitab fi'l-Adwiya al-mufrada'' mentioned by [[al-Dhahabi]].<ref>Camilla Adang, Maribel Fierro, Sabine Schmidtke (ed.), ''Ibn ?azm of Cordoba: The Life and Works of a Controversial Thinker'', BRILL, 2012, p. 685</ref>

==Views==
===Language===
In addition to his views on honesty in communication, Ibn Hazm also addressed the science of language to some degree. He viewed the [[Arabic language]], the [[Hebrew language]] and the [[Syriac language]] as all essentially being one language which branched out as the speakers settled in different geographic regions and developed different vocabularies and grammars from the common root.<ref name=kees175>[[Kees Versteegh]], ''The Arabic Linguistic Tradition'', pg. 175. Volume three of Landmarks in Linguistic Thought. [[London]]: [[Routledge]], 1997. {{ISBN|9780415157575}}</ref> He also differed with many Muslim theologians in that he did not view Arabic as superior to other languages since the Qur'an does not describe Arabic as such. Ibn Hazm viewed that there was no proof for claiming any language was superior to another.<ref name=kees175/>

===Literalism===
Ibn Hazm was well known for his strict literalism and is considered the champion of the literalist Zahirite school within Sunni Islām. A commonly-cited example is his interpretation of the first half of verse 23 in the Qur'anic chapter of [[Al-Isra]] prohibiting one from saying "uff" to one's parents. Ibn Hazm said that half of the verse prohibits only saying "uff", not hitting one's parents, for example.<ref>Robert Gleave, ''Islam and Literalism: Literal Meaning and Interpretation in Islamic Legal Theory'', pg. 169. [[Edinburgh]]: [[Edinburgh University Press]], 2012. {{ISBN|9780748625703}}</ref> However, he considered that hitting them is prohibited by the second half of the verse as well as verse 24 which command kind treatment of parents.<ref>Robert Gleave, ''Islam and Literalism'', pg. 170.</ref><ref>Ibn Hazm, ''al-Ihkam fi Usul al-Ahkam'', vol. 7, pg. 976. Ed. Mahmud Hamid Uthman. Cairo: Dar al-Hadith, 2005. {{ISBN|9772251191}}</ref>

===Philosophy===
Ibn Hazm's works lightly touched upon the traditions of Greek philosophy. Agreeing with both [[Epicurus]] and [[Prodicus of Ceos]], he stated that pleasure brings happiness in life and that there is nothing to fear in death. He believed that these philosophical traditions were useful but not enough to build an individual's character properly, and he stated that the Islamic faith was also necessary.<ref name="Sharif" />

The concept of absolute [[free will]] was rejected by Ibn Hazm, as he believed that all of an individual's attributes are created by [[God in Islam|God]].<ref name="Sharif" />

===Shia===
Ibn Hazm was highly critical of the Shia.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Israel Friedlaender|title=The Heterodoxies of the Shiites in the Presentation of Ibn Hazm|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1908|volume=29|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/fantastic/TheHeterodoxies.pdf|access-date=11 April 2015|publisher=American Oriental Society}}</ref> He said about the sect:<blockquote>The Persians possessed a great kingdom and an upper hand above all other nations. They magnified the danger they posed [to others nations] by calling themselves al-Ahrār (the free ones) and al-Asyād (the noble ones). As a result, they considered all other people their slaves. However, they were afflicted with the destruction of their empire at the hands of the Arabs whom they had considered a lesser danger among the other nations [to their empire]. Their affairs became exacerbated and their afflictions doubled as they plotted wars against Islam various times. However, in all of their plots, Allāh made the Truth manifest. They continued to plot more useful stunts. So, some of their people accepted Islām only to turn towards Shī'ism, with the claim of loving Ahl al-Bayt (the family of the Prophet) and abhorrence to the oppression against 'Alī. Then, they traversed upon this way until it led them away from the path of Guidance [Islām].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kitab al-Fisal fi al-milal wa-al-ahwa' wa-al-nihal|last=Ibn Hazm|first='Ali|pages=2/273}}</ref></blockquote>

===Homosexuality===
Ibn Hazm states in no uncertain terms that homosexual acts between men constitute a sin, since they are expressly condemned in the Quran and the Sunna.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Adang |first1=Camilla |title=Ibn Hazm on Homosexuality. A case of Zahiri legal methodolgy |journal=Al-Qanṭara |date=2003 |volume=24 |pages=5–31 |doi=10.3989/ALQANTARA.2003.V24.I1.172 |s2cid=170550553 }}</ref> <ref>Quran An-Naml (The Ants) 27:55</ref> However, his rejection of qiyàs prevents him from assimilating liwàt to zinâ: illicit sex between a man and a woman.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Adang |first1=Camilla |title=Ibn Hazm on Homosexuality.

==Reception==
Muslim scholars, especially those subscribing to Zahirism, have often praised Ibn Hazm for what they perceive as his knowledge and perseverance. [[Yemen]]i preacher [[Muqbil bin Hadi al-Wadi'i]] was one of Ibn Hazm's admirers in recent times, holding the view that no other Muslim scholar had embodied the [[Sunnah|prophetic tradition]] of the [[Muhammad]] and the [[Sahaba]]. On several occasions, al-Wadi'i rejected the validity of [[Qiyas]] while referencing Ibn Hazm's works. As a matter of fact, al-Wadi'i would at times advice his students to be [[Zahiri]] when approaching [[Fiqh]] altogether. <ref>Al-Waadi'i, Muqbil "Ijabat al-Sa`il fi Ahamm al-Masa`il", pg. 333</ref> Similarly, Pakistani cleric Badi' ud-Din Shah al-Rashidi taught Ibn Hazm's book Al-Muhalla to students in [[Masjid al-Haram]], while living in [[Mecca]].<ref name=meezaan>Abdullaah Nasir Rehmaani, [http://ahlulhadeeth.wordpress.com/2007/10/16/the-life-of-allaamah-sayyid-badee-ud-deen-shah-ar-raashidee-as-sindhee-by-allamaah-abdullaah-naasir-rehmaanee/ "A Biography of Shaykh Badee-ud-Deen Shah Rashidee as-Sindhee."] Trns. Abu Naasir and Abu Handhala. Prepared by al-Meezaan.com.</ref> al-Wadi'i himself taught Al-Muhalla in [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]], while in [[Medina]]. [[Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri]], the primary biographer of Ibn Hazm in the modern era, has authored a number of works on Ibn Hazm's life and career, many published through Ibn Aqil's printing press which is named after Ibn Hazm.<ref>See:<br/>*[[Maribel Fierro]], "Heresy in al-Andalus".

Modernist revival of Ibn Hazm's general critique of Islamic legal theory has seen several key moments in Arab intellectual history, including [[Ahmad Shakir]]'s re-publishing of Al-Muhalla, [[Muhammad Abu Zahra]]'s biography of Ibn Hazm, and the re-publishing of archived epistles on legal theory by [[Sa'id al-Afghani]] in 1960 and [[Ihsan Abbas]] between 1980 and 1983.<ref>Adam Sabra, "Ibn Hazm's Literalism: A Critique of Islamic Legal Theory".
