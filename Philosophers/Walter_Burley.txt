'''Walter Burley''' (or '''Burleigh'''; {{c.}} 1275 – 1344/45) was an English [[scholastic philosopher]] and [[logician]] with at least 50 works attributed to him. He studied under [[Thomas Wilton]]<ref name=Gill>Harjeet Singh Gill, ''Signification in language and culture'', Indian Institute of Advanced Study, 2002, p. 109.</ref> and received his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|Master of Arts]] degree in 1301, and was a [[fellow]] of [[Merton College]], Oxford until about 1310. He then spent sixteen years in Paris, becoming a fellow of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] by 1324, before spending 17 years as a clerical courtier in England and [[Avignon]]. Burley disagreed with [[William of Ockham]] on a number of points concerning logic and [[natural philosophy]]. He was known as the ''Doctor Planus et Perspicuus''.

==Early life==
Burley was born in 1274 or 1275, possibly in [[Burley-in-Wharfedale]], [[Yorkshire]], or in [[Burley, Leeds|Burley]] near [[Leeds]].{{r|ODNB}} Little is known of his early life. He was made rector of [[Welbury]] in Yorkshire in 1309, probably through the influence of Sir John de Lisle, a friend of [[William Greenfield]].{{sfnp|Ottman|Wood|1999|p=9}} As throughout his career, he did not act as rector, employing a substitute and using the income from the living to finance his study in Paris, where he completed his lectures on Peter Lombard's ''[[Sentences]]'', and probably encountered the work of his contemporary [[William of Ockham]]. Burley's commentary on the ''Sentences'' has not survived.{{sfnp|Ottman|Wood|1999|p=10}}

==Political career==
Burley became a courtier during the political events that followed the deposition of [[Edward II]] of England in 1327. His first assignment was to try and obtain the [[canonisation]] of [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], who had been one of the leaders of the baronial opposition to Edward II; Thomas had become venerated as a [[martyr]] within a few months of his death. Burley was sent to the [[Avignon Papacy|papal court at Avignon]] to appeal directly to [[Pope John XXII]]. By coincidence, William of Ockham was also staying at Avignon, having been summoned there in 1324 to answer charges of possibly heretical statements (by 1326 there was a list of 51 charges against him).

Burley's associates were all closely involved in these attempts at canonisation (none of which was successful). One was [[Richard de Bury]], a bibliophile and patron of the arts and sciences, who became Burley's patron and at whose request Bury translated some works of [[Aristotle]] into English.{{r|Denholm}}

==Philosophical work==
Burley was one of the first medieval logicians to recognize the priority of the [[propositional calculus]] over the [[term logic]],<ref>[[Laurent Cesalli]], "Meaning and Truth", in A. D. Conti (ed.), ''A Companion to Walter Burley'', Leiden: Brill, 2013, p. 92.</ref> despite the fact that the latter had been the main focus of logicians until then. Burley also seems to have been the only 14th-century logician to have taken the position that, in line with modern views on the [[material conditional]], the principle that "from the impossible anything follows" ("''ex impossibili sequitur quodlibet''") is both a [[necessary and sufficient condition]] for explaining the logical relationship between [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and [[consequent]].{{sfnp|Jacobi|1993|p=162}}
He was also known for his commentaries on Aristotle's [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']], which include the quodlibet ''De Primo et ultimo instanti'' (around 1320) and the longer work ''Expositio in libros octo de physico auditu''.{{r|Sylla}}
Burley wrote 39 Commentaries on Aristotle and 32 Treatises and Questions (many unedited).<ref>Marta Vittorini, ''Appendix: A Complete List of Burley's Works'', in A. D. Conti (ed.), ''A Companion to Walter Burley'', Leiden: Brill, 2013, pp.46-47.</ref>

* ''De Puritate Artis Logicae'', in two versions:
** ''Tractatus brevior'' (before 1324)
** ''Tractatus longior'' (1325–28)
This is Burley's main work, in which he covers such topics as the truth conditions for complex sentences, both [[truth-functional]] and [[Modal logic|modal]], as well as providing rules of inferences for different types of inferences. This book is known to have been written after Ockham's ''[[Summa Logicae]]'' (c. 1323), possibly partly in response to it.{{sfnp|Böhner|1952|p=44}}
