== Early life ==
{{Vaishnavism}}
Ramanuja was born into a [[Tamil Brahmin]] community, in a village called [[Sriperumbudur]] (present-day Tamil Nadu) under the [[Chola dynasty|Chola Empire]]. His followers in the Vaishnava tradition wrote hagiographies, some of which were composed in centuries after his death, and which the tradition believes to be true.<ref name="Sydnor2012p20">{{cite book|author=Jon Paul Sydnor|title=Rāmānuja and Schleiermacher: Toward a Constructive Comparative Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae4FBAAAQBAJ|year=2012|publisher=Casemate|isbn=978-0227680247|pages=20–22 with footnote 32|access-date=5 October 2016|archive-date=16 January 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240116175559/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae4FBAAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==
Ramanuja became a priest at the [[Varadharaja Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram|Varadharāja Perumal temple]] ([[Vishnu]]) at [[Kanchipuram|Kānchipuram]], where he began to teach that [[moksha]] (liberation and release from ''[[Saṃsāra|samsara]]'') is to be achieved not with metaphysical, ''nirguna'' [[Brahman]] but with the help of personal god and ''saguna'' Vishnu. Ramanuja believed that when scriptures such as the Vedas declare god as nirguna, they should be interpreted as saying that qualities such as pain, sorrow, mortality and age are absent in god.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Sydnor2012p87">{{cite book|author=Jon Paul Sydnor|title=Rāmānuja and Schleiermacher: Toward a Constructive Comparative Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae4FBAAAQBAJ|year=2012|publisher=Casemate|isbn=978-0227680247|pages=84–87|access-date=5 October 2016|archive-date=16 January 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240116175559/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae4FBAAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> Ramanuja has long enjoyed foremost authority in the Sri Vaishnava tradition.{{Sfn|Carman|1994|p=82 with footnotes}}

===Hagiographies===
A number of traditional biographies of Ramanuja are known, some written in 12th century, but some written centuries later such as the 17th or 18th century, particularly after the split of the {{IAST|Śrīvaiṣṇava}} community into the [[Vadakalais|{{IAST|Vadakalais}}]] and [[Teṉkalais|{{IAST|Teṉkalais}}]], where each community created its own version of Ramanuja's hagiography.<ref name=kathyoungvp287>{{cite book|author=Katherine Young|editor=Steven Rosen|title=Vaiṣṇavī|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBEiXtey-9UC|year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1437-0|pages=286–288}}</ref>{{Sfn|Keith E.

Other late biographies include the ''Yatirajavaibhavam'' by Andhrapurna.<ref name=kathyoungvp287/>

== Historical background ==
Ramanuja grew up in the Tamil culture, in a stable society during the rule of the [[Chola dynasty]].{{Sfn|Carman|1994|p=80}} This period was one of pluralistic beliefs, where Vaishnava, Shaiva, Smarta traditions, Buddhism and Jainism thrived together. In Hindu monastic tradition, Advaita Vedānta had been dominant,<ref name=olivellehsarp10/> and Ramanuja's guru Yādava Prākāsha belonged to this tradition.<ref name=":0" /> Prior to Ramanuja, the [[Sri Vaishnavism|Sri Vaishnava sampradaya]] was already an established organization under Yamunāchārya, and bhakti songs and devotional ideas already a part of Tamil culture because of the twelve [[Alvars|Alvārs]].<ref name="Sydnor2012p10">{{cite book| author=Jon Paul Sydnor| title=Rāmānuja and Schleiermacher: Toward a Constructive Comparative Theology| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae4FBAAAQBAJ| year=2012| publisher=Casemate| isbn=978-0227680247| pages=10–11| access-date=5 October 2016| archive-date=16 January 2024| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240116175559/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae4FBAAAQBAJ| url-status=live}}</ref> Ramanuja's fame grew because he was considered the first thinker in centuries that disputed Shankara's theories, and offered an alternative interpretation of Upanishadic scriptures.{{Sfn|Carman|1994|p=80}}

===Early life===
When Ramanuja and his guru [[Yadava Prakaasa]] parted ways due to their differences in interpreting the [[Vedas|Vedic literature]], Ramanuja became a devotee of the [[Varadharaja Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram|Varadaraja Perumal temple]] in [[Kanchi]]. During this period, Ramanuja's discourses and fame reached far and wide. [[Yamunacharya]], the Vaishnavite acharya and the religious head of the [[Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam|Ranganathasamy temple]] at [[Srirangam]] had been closely following Ramanuja from a very young age. When it was time to pass on the legacy, the acharya decided that he would call upon Ramanuja. Accordingly, he summoned Sri Mahapurna, a disciple who was helping him out with the temple affairs and asked him to go to Kanchi and bring Ramanuja.<ref name=Latha >{{cite book|title=Sri Ramanuja Pictorial|author=Smt. Latha Balasubramanian|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math}}</ref>

When Mahapurna met Ramanuja and informed him of his guru's desire, Ramanuja was overjoyed and they both immediately left for Srirangam. But bad news awaited them at Srirangam and they both learned that Yamunacharya had died. Heart-broken, Ramanuja then left for Kanchi and refused to worship Sri Ranganatha for he held him responsible for taking away Yamunacharya from this world.<ref name=ramakrishna/> As for Mahapurna, he began to assist Tiruvaranga Araiyar, the son of Yamunacharya in managing the temple affairs. But as time passed by, Tiruvaranga Araiyar and other senior members of the Vaishnavite order felt that there was a vacuum after Yamunacharya's demise and that they lacked a person who could interpret the Vedas and Sastras like Yamunacharya. So it was finally decided that Sri Mahapurna should once again go and invite Ramanuja to Srirangam.<ref name=ramakrishna/>

Meanwhile, in Kanchi, Ramanuja met with [[Kanchipurna]], a fellow devotee, regularly and soon decided that he would become Kanchipurna's disciple. When he approached Kanchipurna about this, Kanchipurna politely refused as he did not belong to the same caste as Ramanuja and told him that he would get a more appropriate guru.<ref name=ramakrishna>{{cite book|title=The Complete Works of Swami Ramakrishnananda, Volume 2|author=Compilation|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc, 2014}}</ref> After this Kanchipurna left for [[Tirupati]] to worship Lord Venkateswara and would return only after six months. When he finally came back, it was through him that Lord Varadaraja conveyed his wish to Ramanuja. Accordingly, Kanchipurna advised Ramanuja that it was the Lord's wish that he leave for [[Srirangam]] and find solace in Sri Mahapurna.<ref name=Latha/>{{sfn|Narasimhacharya|2004|p=21}}

===Induction into Vaishnavism===

After it was decided that Mahapurna would go and invite Ramanuja to [[Srirangam]], the acharya left for Kanchi with his wife. While on his way to Kanchi, Mahapurna and his wife decided to take some rest at [[Maduranthakam]], a place that is located 40&nbsp;km from present day [[Chennai]]. As fate would have it Ramanuja, who was on his way to Srirangam, arrived at the same place and to his joy found Mahapurna. They soon embraced each other and Ramanuja requested that he waste no time in initiating him into the Vaishnavite order. Mahapurna immediately obliged and Ramanuja received the Panchasamskaras (the five sacraments).{{sfn|Narasimhacharya|2004|p=21}}

===Persecution===
Some hagiographies, composed centuries after Ramanuja died, state that a Chola king, [[Kulothunga Chola II|Kulothunga II]],<ref name=kvraman15/> had immense hatred towards Sri Vaishnavism. He was called Krimikanta Chola or worm-necked Chola, so called as the king is said to have suffered from the cancer of the neck or throat.<ref>{{cite book|title=Impact of Śrī Rāmānujāçārya on Temple Worship|author=Sarojini Jagannathan|publisher=Nag Publishers, 1994|page=114}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=History of People and Their Environs: Essays in Honour of Prof. B.S.

Sri Rāmānujā then moved to Hoysala kingdom for 14 years, wherein he converted a Jain king, Bitti Deva to Hinduism after miraculously healing his daughter. Bitti Deva changed his name to [[Vishnuvardhana]]. King Vishnuvardhana assisted Sri Rāmānujā to build a temple of Lord Thirunarayanaswamy at [[Melukote]], which is now a temple town in [[Mandya]] district of [[Karnataka]].

===Reformation===
The Sri Vaishnavite order prior to Ramanuja was not averse to people from other castes as both Kanchipurna and Mahapurna were non-Brahmins.<ref name=ramakrishna/> So when Ramanuja revolted against the discrimination that had crept within the caste system, he was simply following the same lines as the [[Alwars]] and helped the people who were considered to be untouchables (dasa, dasulu, dasu), to get absorbed into the Sri Vaishnava Bhakti Movement, encouraging them to attain Spiritual enlightenment by teaching them Sri Alwar Divyaprabandham. He called these downtrodden classes as ''Tirukulattar'', meaning "of noble descent" in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and was instrumental in admitting them into the temple in [[Melukote]].{{sfn|Narasimhacharya|2004|p=11}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Reservation and Affirmative Action: Models of Social Integration in India and the United States|author=Arvind Sharma|publisher=SAGE, 2005|page=139}}</ref> Ramanuja's liberal views also led to the reorganization of rituals in Srirangam and the involvement of non-Brahmin people in the Vaishnava worship. This policy change contributed to the enhancement of social status for artisanal and other non-Brahmin caste groups, especially the weavers ([[Kaikolar|SenguntharKaikola Mudaliyar]]) who were one of the chief beneficiaries.

== Attempts on Ramanuja's life ==

There were multiple attempts on Ramanuja's life. When he was a student under Yadava Prakasa, the latter grew jealous of Ramanuja's rise to fame. So Yadava Prakasa tried to get rid of Ramanuja during a tour to the Ganges in northern India. Govinda, Ramanuja's cousin (son of his mother's sister),<ref name=relatives/> learned of this plot and warned Ramanuja who then left the group and escaped to Kanchi with the help of an elderly hunter couple. Later Yadava Prakasa realised his folly and became a disciple under Ramanuja.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Vedanta Kesari, Volume 76|author=Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math., 1989|page=90}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FM9ACgAAQBAJ&q=ramanuja|title=Sri Ramanuja: His Life Religion and Philosophy|author=Swami Tapasyananda|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc, 2013|isbn=9781304729071|date=19 December 2013}}</ref>

Later another attempt was made on Ramanuja's life while he was about to take charge of the temple affairs in [[Srirangam]]. The head priest of the [[Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam]] did not like Ramanuja and decided to kill him. Accordingly, he invited Ramanuja to his house for having food and planned to kill him by poisoning his food. However, when Ramanuja arrived, the priest's wife saw the divine glow of Ramanuja and immediately confessed her husband's plan. This did not deter the priest who then made another attempt when Ramanuja visited the temple. He poisoned the temple ''Theertham''(holy water) and served it to Ramanuja. However instead of dying Ramanuja began to dance with joy. The priest taken aback at once realised his mistake and fell at the feet of Ramanuja.<ref>{{cite book|title=Saints of India: Sri Ramanuja|author=Shiri Ram Bakshi, Sangh Mittra|publisher=Criterion, 2002|pages=201–202}}</ref>

== Writings ==
The Sri Vaisnava tradition attributes nine Sanskrit texts to Ramanuja – ''[[Vedarthasamgraha]]'' (literally, "Summary of the Vedas's meaning"), ''[[Sri Bhasya|Sri Bhashya]]'' (a review and commentary on the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]''), ''[[Gita Bhashya|Bhagavad Gita Bhashya]]'' (a review and commentary on the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''), and the minor works titled ''Vedantadipa'', ''Vedantasara'', ''Gadya Trayam'' (which is a compilation of three texts called the ''[[Saranagati Gadyam|Sharanagati Gadyam]]'', ''[[Sriranga Gadyam]],'' and the ''[[Vaikunta Gadyam|Vaikuntha Gadyam]]''), and the ''Nitya Grantham''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lipner |first=Julius J. |title=The Face of Truth: A Study of Meaning and Metaphysics in the Vedantic Theology of Ramanuja |date=1986-03-30 |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-88706-039-7 |location=Albany, N.

[[File:Shri Ramanujar pics 2.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The figure of Ramanuja in Upadesa Mudra inside the [[Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam]]. It is believed to be his preserved mortal remains.]]
Ramanuja's philosophical foundation was qualified [[monism]], and is called ''Vishishtadvaita'' in the Hindu tradition.<ref name=brucesullivan239/><ref name=joeschultz81/> His ideas are one of three subschools in [[Vedanta|Vedānta]], the other two are known as Ādi Shankara's Advaita (absolute monism) and Madhvāchārya's Dvaita (dualism).<ref name=brucesullivan239/>

=== Rāmānuja’s Epistemology ===
Rāmānuja's epistemology is [[Hyperreality|hyperrealistic]] or similar to [[naïve empiricism]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ramanuja {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/hinduism-biographies/ramanuja|access-date=2021-11-15|website=www.encyclopedia.com|archive-date=15 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211115082514/https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/hinduism-biographies/ramanuja|url-status=live}}</ref> The first two sources of knowledge are perception and inference, and they are trustworthy notwithstanding general human subjection to "beginningless ignorance." Knowledge is always of the real, even in dreams, and error is a disordered perception or faulty inference concerning what is really there. The third source of knowledge is the testimony of scripture, or more strictly, ''[[Shabda|śabda]]'' ("eternal sound"), which helps to establish much that is uncertain on the basis of sense perception and inference, notably the existence and nature of the ultimate reality (''[[brahman]]''). Though unlike some proponents of naïve empiricism, Rāmānuja does not think that it suffices to intermittently have an acquaintance with objects of knowledge. Knowledge (''jñāna'') only occurs when there is direct perception of an object. Unlike proper empiricists, Rāmānuja does not restrict knowledge to that which can be gathered from the senses.<ref>{{Cite news|last=T.c.a.ramanujam|date=2016-11-24|title=His philosophy was based on Vedic texts|language=en-IN|work=The Hindu|url=https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/His-philosophy-was-based-on-Vedic-texts/article16694213.ece|access-date=2021-11-15|issn=0971-751X|archive-date=15 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211115082516/https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/His-philosophy-was-based-on-Vedic-texts/article16694213.ece|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ramanuja {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=https://iep.utm.edu/ramanuja/|access-date=2021-11-15|language=en-US|archive-date=17 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717055536/http://www.iep.utm.edu/ramanuja/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> Rāmānuja asserts that knowledge about God comes exclusively from the Vedic scriptures, particularly the Upanisads, rather than from sensory perception or logical inference.{{Sfn|Bartley|2011|p=172}}

Rāmānuja was unique in his view that ''[[bhakti]]'' or devotion is itself an [[epistemic]] state. He says that when ''bhakti'' takes firm root in an individual, it turns into ''parabhakti'', which is the highest form of ''bhakti'' and that ''bhakti'' is the direct awareness of Brahman's nature and thus is a kind of knowledge (''[[Jnana|jñāna]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ramanuja {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=https://iep.utm.edu/ramanuja/|access-date=2021-11-21|language=en-US|archive-date=17 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717055536/http://www.iep.utm.edu/ramanuja/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Sri Ramanuja">{{Cite book|last=Sri Ramanuja|url=https://archive.org/details/SriBhashyaMelkote|title=Sri Bhashya Of Ramanuja Melkote Edition}}</ref>

=== Ramanuja’s Ontology ===
Being a realist, Rāmānuja firmly opposed the notion of ''[[Maya (religion)|māyā]]'' (illusion). In his understanding, three distinct realities exist: a vast expanse of material objects, countless conscious souls within material bodies, and the transcendent Brahman. Each of these categories possesses a different degree of awareness, from the non-aware material world to the fully-aware Brahman, but they are all equally real. In Rāmānuja's interpretation of advaita (non-dualism), it is not a form of advaita as proposed by [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]. Rāmānuja's conception of bhakti maintains that there must always be a separation between the lover (the soul) and the beloved (Vishnu), for true love cannot exist without distinct identities. His stance suggests a [[Vishishtadvaita|qualified non-dualism]], where both the souls and the material world, though deeply interconnected with Brahman, eternally remain different from Brahman.<ref name="staffordbetty215" />

In Rāmānuja's philosophy, the foundational concept of the soul-body model revolves around the idea that the entire universe, including both souls (''jivas'') and matter (''prakrti''), serves as the body (''sarira'') of God, referred to as "''sarira-sariri-bhava''", where "''sarira''" means body and "''sariri''" means the indwelling soul or consciousness. This concept is rooted in ''sruti'' passages like ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' 3.7.3-23:{{Sfn|Bartley|2011|p=178}}<blockquote>"This soul of yours who is present within but is different from all beings, whom all beings do not know. whose body is all beings, and who controls all beings from within - he is the Inner Controller, the immortal one" - ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' 3.7.14</blockquote>

=== Rāmānuja’s Soteriology ===
According to Rāmānuja, the highest good lies in realizing our true nature and of understanding the true essence of Brahman. ''[[Moksha]]'', or spiritual liberation, is seen as the joy of contemplating [[Brahman]] (rather than release from the life-death-rebirth cycle),<ref name=":0" /> and that joy is the result of devotion, praise, worship and contemplation of divine perfection. Knowledge of ''Brahman'' consists in liberation, for Rāmānuja, mainly because of the character of ''Brahman''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What is Vishishtadvaita? - Definition from Yogapedia|url=http://www.yogapedia.com/definition/10537/vishishtadvaita|access-date=2021-11-20|website=Yogapedia.com|language=en|archive-date=20 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211120134638/https://www.yogapedia.com/definition/10537/vishishtadvaita|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Ramanuja, Brahman encompasses everything but is not uniform in nature. It includes elements of plurality, allowing it to manifest in a diverse world. Ramanuja views Brahman as a personal god who rules over a real world filled with his spirit. He believes Brahman to have the attributes of “omnipotence, omniscience and infinite love”.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Sivanada |first=Sri Swami |title=All About Hinduism |publisher=The Divine Life Society |year=1997 |isbn=81-7052-047-9 |edition=6 |location=India |pages=137 |language=English}}</ref> He writes:<blockquote>"Entities other than ''Brahman'' can be objects of such cognitions of the nature of joy only to a finite extent and for limited duration. But ''Brahman'' is such that cognizing of him is an infinite and abiding joy. It is for this reason that the ''śruti'' [scripture] says, `''Brahman'' is bliss’ (''[[Taittiriya Upanishad|Taittirīya Upaniṣad]]'' II.6.) Since the form of cognition as joy is determined by its object, ''Brahman'' itself is joy."<ref name="iep.utm.edu">{{Cite web|title=Ramanuja {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=https://iep.utm.edu/ramanuja/|access-date=2021-11-20|language=en-US|archive-date=17 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717055536/http://www.iep.utm.edu/ramanuja/|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>Rāmānuja clarifies that mere theoretical knowledge of ''Brahman''‘s nature is insufficient for attaining m''oksha''.<ref name="Sri Ramanuja"/> According to Rāmānuja, [[Bhakti yoga|''bhakti'' yoga]], the discipline of devotion or worship, is the effective means for liberation.<ref name="iep.utm.edu"/> In his interpretation, ''moksha'' is not a negative separation from transmigration, or a series of rebirths, but rather the joy of the contemplating the divine perfection. This joy is attained by a life of exclusive devotion (''[[bhakti]]'') to Brahman, singing his praise, performing adulatory acts in temple and private worship, and constantly dwelling on his perfections. In return, Brahman will offer his grace, which will assist the devotee in gaining release.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Vishishtadvaita {{!}} Hindu philosophy {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vishishtadvaita|access-date=2021-11-20|website=www.britannica.com|language=en|archive-date=20 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211120134633/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vishishtadvaita|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Sukthankar|first=Vasudev Anant|url=https://rarebooksocietyofindia.org/book_archive/196174216674_10152156872361675.pdf|title=The Teachings of Vedanta according to Ramanuja|pages=20–25|access-date=20 November 2021|archive-date=20 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211120134638/https://rarebooksocietyofindia.org/book_archive/196174216674_10152156872361675.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

=== Ramanuja's Ethics ===
Ramanuja's ethical framework asserts that morality has both intrinsic and instrumental value. Intrinsically, morality mirrors the divine nature of God, who is morally perfect and needs no external reasons to be moral. Instrumentally, morality serves as a means to alleviate the karmic burdens of past wrongdoings and to appease the divine, thus facilitating spiritual liberation. Ramanuja emphasizes that while detachment through ''jnana yoga'' is possible in theory, it is impractical for most. Instead, he advocates ''karma yoga'', which involves fulfilling duties based on individual capabilities and nature, making morality accessible and suited to individual lives.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ramanuja {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=https://iep.utm.edu/ramanuja/ |access-date=2024-05-12 |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Criticism of Sankara ===
Ramanuja argued that [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s interpretation of the [[Upanishads]] had serious errors.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ramanuja {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/hinduism-biographies/ramanuja|access-date=2021-11-21|website=www.encyclopedia.com|archive-date=15 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211115082514/https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/hinduism-biographies/ramanuja|url-status=live}}</ref> He had four major objections:

# Brahman was differentiated consciousness and not undifferentiated consciousness.
# Shankara's concept of [[Nirguna Brahman]] was wrong and untenable.
# Beginningless ''[[karma]],'' and not superimposition, was the cause of ''avidya''.
# Sankara's doctrine of [[Avidyā (Hinduism)|Avidya]] (Ignorance) and [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] (Illusion) has seven major flaws and inconsistencies.{{sfn|Grimes|1990}}

=== Hermeneutic Criticism ===

==== Vedas as Doctrinally Unified Corpus ====
Ramanuja accepted that the Vedas are a reliable source of knowledge, then critiqued other schools of Hindu philosophy, including Advaita Vedānta, as having failed in interpreting all of the Vedic texts.<ref name=shyamriep/> He asserted, in his ''Sri Bhāshya'', that ''purvapaksin'' (previous schools) selectively interpret those Upanishadic passages that support their monistic interpretation, and ignore those passages that support the pluralism interpretation.<ref name=shyamriep/> There is no reason, stated Ramanuja, to prefer one part of a scripture and not other, the whole of the scripture must be considered on par.<ref name=shyamriep/>{{Sfn|Carman|1994|p=86}} One cannot, according to Ramanuja, attempt to give interpretations of isolated portions of any scripture. Rather, the scripture must be considered one integrated corpus, expressing a consistent doctrine.<ref name=shyamriep/> The Vedic literature, asserted Ramanuja, mention both plurality and oneness, therefore the truth must incorporate pluralism and monism, or qualified monism.<ref name=shyamriep>Shyam Ranganathan (2011), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/Rāmānujā/ Ramanuja (c. 1017 - c. 1137)]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, IEP, York University</ref>

This method of scripture interpretation distinguishes Ramanuja from Ādi Shankara.{{Sfn|Carman|1994|p=86}} Shankara's exegetical approach ''Samanvayat Tatparya Linga'' with ''Anvaya-Vyatireka'',{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–53}} states that for proper understanding, all texts must be examined in their entirety, and then their intent established by six characteristics. These include studying what the author states as his goal, what he repeats in his explanation, what he states as his conclusion, and whether it can be [[epistemology|epistemically]] verified.<ref>Mayeda & Tanizawa (1991), Studies on Indian Philosophy in Japan, 1963–1987, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 41, No. 4, pages 529–535</ref><ref>Michael Comans (1996), Śankara and the Prasankhyanavada, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 24, No. 1, pages 49–71</ref> Not everything in any text, states Shankara, has equal weight and some ideas are the essence of any expert's textual testimony.{{Sfn|Carman|1994|p=86}} This philosophical difference in scriptural studies helped Shankara conclude that the [[Principal Upanishads]] primarily teach monism with teachings such as ''Tat tvam asi'', while helping Ramanuja conclude that qualified monism is at the foundation of Hindu spirituality.<ref name=shyamriep/>{{Sfn|Carman|1994|pp=86-88}}<ref>[[Julius Lipner]] (1986), The Face of Truth: A Study of Meaning and Metaphysics in the Vedantic Theology of Rāmānujā, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887060397}}, pages 120-123</ref>

=== Comparison with other Vedānta schools ===
Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita shares the theistic devotionalism ideas with [[Madhvacharya|Madhvāchārya]]'s Dvaita.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=11-17, 372}} Both schools assert that Jīva (souls) and Brahman (as Vishnu) are different, a difference that is never transcended.<ref name=staffordbetty215>Stafford Betty (2010), Dvaita, Advaita, and Viśiṣṭādvaita: Contrasting Views of Mokṣa, Asian Philosophy: An International Journal of the Philosophical Traditions of the East, Volume 20, Issue 2, pages 215-224</ref><ref>Edward Craig (2000), Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415223645}}, pages 517-518</ref> God Vishnu alone is independent, all other gods and beings are dependent on Him, according to both Madhvāchārya and Ramanuja.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=373}} However, in contrast to Madhvāchārya's views, Ramanuja asserts "qualified non-dualism",{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}} that souls share the same essential nature of Brahman,{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}} and that there is a universal sameness in the quality and degree of bliss possible for human souls, and every soul can reach the bliss state of God Himself.<ref name=staffordbetty215/>{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|pp=373-374}} While the 13th- to 14th-century Madhavāchārya asserted both "qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls", Ramanuja asserted "qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism of souls", states Sharma.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=374}}

Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita school and [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s Advaita school are both [[Nonduality (spirituality)|nondualistic]] Vedānta schools,<ref name=":0" /><ref name=cetternonplu/> both are premised on the assumption that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvāchārya believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|pp=374-375}}{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=361-362}} Shankara's theory posits that only Brahman and causes are metaphysical unchanging reality, while the empirical world ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]) and observed effects are changing, illusive and of relative existence.<ref name="Sydnor2012p87"/><ref name=joeschultz81/> Spiritual liberation to Shankara is the full comprehension and realization of oneness of one's unchanging Ātman (soul) as the same as Ātman in everyone else as well as being identical to the ''nirguna'' Brahman.<ref name=williamindichcav1/><ref name=cetternonplu>{{Cite book|author=Christopher Etter|title=A Study of Qualitative Non-Pluralism| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jW2pcWpXY8wC| year=2006| publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-39312-1|pages=57–60, 63–65}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Roy W.
