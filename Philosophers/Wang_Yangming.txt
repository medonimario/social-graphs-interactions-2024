'''Wang Shouren''' ({{Zh|c=王守仁}}, 26 October 1472 &ndash; 9 January 1529), [[courtesy name]] '''Bo'an''' ({{Zh|c=伯安}}), [[art name]] '''Yangmingzi''' ({{Zh|s=阳明子|t=陽明子|first=t}}), usually referred to as '''Wang Yangming''' ({{Zh|s=王阳明|t=王陽明|first=t}}), was a Chinese [[philosopher]],  general, politician, writer, and [[calligrapher]] during the [[Ming dynasty]]. After [[Zhu Xi]], he is commonly regarded as the most important [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] thinker,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://iep.utm.edu/wangyang/#:~:text=Wang%27s%20legacy%20in%20Neo%2DConfucian,to%20what%20one%20could%20be. | title=Wang Yangming (Wang Shou-Jen) &#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy }}</ref> for his interpretations of [[Confucianism]] that denied the rationalist [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] of the orthodox philosophy of Zhu Xi. Wang and [[Lu Xiangshan]] are regarded as the founders as the [[Lu–Wang school]], or the School of the Mind.

In China, Japan, and Western countries, he is known by his honorific name rather than his private name.<ref>Chan, Wing-tsit. ''Sourcebook in Chinese Philosophy''.

==Life and times==
[[File:Grand hall of Wang Shouren's Residence.JPG|left|thumb|Grand Hall, Wang Yangming's former residence]]
Wang was born in [[Yuyao]], [[Zhejiang Province]], to a scholarly family with a tradition of bureaucratic service. His father, Wang Hua, was first (''Zhuangyuan'', 狀元) in the [[Imperial Examination]] of 1481, and rose to become the vice-minister of the [[Ministry of Rites]], but was later demoted and subsequently expelled from government service for having offended [[Liu Jin]], a eunuch.

Wang earned the [[Imperial examination|''juren'']] degree in 1492 and the [[Jinshi (imperial examination)|''jinshi'']] degree in 1499. He later served as an executive assistant in various government departments until banishment for offending a eunuch in 1506.<ref name="Chan654">Chan 1963: 654.</ref> However, his professional career resumed when he became the Governor of [[Jiangxi]].<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 372">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 372.</ref>

===Military exploits===
Wang became a successful general and was known for the strict discipline he imposed on his troops. In 1517 and 1518, he was dispatched in response to petitions to suppress peasant revolts in [[Jiangxi]], [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]]. Concerned with the destruction that came with war, he petitioned the court to allow [[amnesty]], and successfully destroyed rebel military forces.

====Suppressing the Prince of Ning rebellion====
{{main|Prince of Ning rebellion}}
[[File:Tomb of Wang Yangming.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Tomb of Wang Yangming at Shaoxing]]
In 1519 AD, while he was governor of Jiangxi province and on his way to suppress the revolts in [[Fujian]], Wang was suddenly faced with the [[Prince of Ning rebellion]], led by [[Zhu Chenhao]] the fourth Prince of Ning. Given that the prince's base in [[Nanchang]] allowed him to sail down the [[Yangtze River]] and capture the southern capital of [[Nanjing]], Wang actively prepared for battle to prevent that possibility, while engaging in deception to convince the prince that armies were moving to surround him. The prince, deceived by this, hesitated and gave time for Nanjing to be reinforced. Eventually, forced to engage governmental forces, the Prince of Ning was defeated and captured.

In this campaign, Wang also made one of the earliest references to using the ''fo-lang-ji'' in battle, a [[breech-loading weapon|breech loading]] [[culverin]] [[cannon]] imported from the newly arrived [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] venturers to China.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 372"/> As governor of Jiangxi he also built schools, rehabilitated the rebels, and reconstructed what was lost by the enemy during the revolt. Though he was made an earl, he was ostracized for opposing [[Zhu Xi]].<ref name="Chan654" />

Thirty-eight years after his death, he was given the titles [[Marquis]] and Completion of Culture. In 1584 he was offered sacrifice in the [[Confucian Temple]], the highest honour for a scholar.<ref name="Chan654" />

==Philosophy==
[[File:Wang Shoujen.jpg|thumb|Wang Yangming]]
{{see also|Yangmingism}}
Wang was the leading figure in the Neo-Confucian [[Yangmingism|School of heart]], founded by [[Lu Jiuyuan]] (陸九淵, or Lu Xiangshan) of the [[Southern Song]]. This school championed an interpretation of [[Mencius]], a Classical Confucian who became the focus of later interpretation, that unified knowledge with action. Their rival school, the [[Cheng-Zhu school|School of Principle]] (''Li'') treated gaining knowledge as a kind of preparation or cultivation that, when completed, could guide action.

===Innate knowing===
Out of Cheng-Zhu's [[Neo-Confucianism]] that was mainstream at the time, Wang Yangming developed the idea of ''innate knowing'', arguing that every person knows from birth the difference between good and evil. Wang claimed that such knowledge is intuitive and not rational.  These revolutionizing ideas of Wang Yangming would later inspire prominent Japanese thinkers like [[Motoori Norinaga]], who argued that because of the [[Shinto]] deities, Japanese people alone had the intuitive ability to distinguish good and evil without complex rationalization.  His school of thought (''Ōyōmei-gaku'' in Japanese, ''Ō'' stands for the surname "Wang", ''yōmei'' stands for "Yangming", ''gaku'' stands for "school of learning") also greatly influenced the Japanese [[samurai]] ethic.

===Integration of Knowledge and Action===
{{Main|Unity of knowledge and action}}
Wang's rejection of the pure investigation of knowledge comes from the then traditional view of Chinese belief that once one gained knowledge, one had a duty to put that knowledge into action. This presupposed two possibilities:
That one can have knowledge without/prior to corresponding action or that one can know what is the proper action, but still fail to act.

Wang rejected both of these which allowed him to develop his [[philosophy]] of action. Wang believed that 
only through spontaneous action could one gain knowledge and denied all other ways of gaining it. To him, there was no way to use knowledge after gaining it because he believed that knowledge and action were unified as one. Any knowledge that had been gained ''then put'' into action was considered delusion or false.

===Mind and the world===
He held that objects do not exist entirely apart from the [[mind]] because the mind shapes them. He believed that it is not the world that shapes the mind, but the mind that gives [[reason]] to the world. Therefore, the mind alone is the source of all reason. He understood this to be an inner light, an innate moral goodness and understanding of what is good.

In order to eliminate selfish desires that cloud the mind's understanding of goodness, one can practice his type of meditation often called "tranquil repose" or "sitting still" (靜坐 ''[[jingzuo]]''). This is similar to the practice of Chan ([[Zen]]) meditation in [[Buddhism]].

== Influence ==
Wang Yangming is regarded one of the greatest masters of [[Confucianism]] in history along with [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]] and [[Zhu Xi]] ({{lang-zh|t=[[:zh:孔孟朱王|孔孟朱王]]|labels=no}}).
He founded "[[Yangmingism|Yaojiang School]]" ({{lang-zh|t=[[:zh:姚江學派|姚江學派]]|labels=no}}) or "Yangming School of Mind" ({{lang-zh|t=[[:zh:心學|陽明心學]]|labels=no}}), which became one of the dominant Confucian schools in the mid-late Ming period and [[Qing]] period China. The typical figures came from this school after Wang were Wang Ji ({{lang-zh|t=[[:zh:王龍溪|王龍溪]]|labels=no}}), Qian Dehong ({{lang-zh|t=[[:zh:錢德洪|錢德洪]]|labels=no}}), [[Wang Gen]], [[Huang Zongxi]], [[Li Zhi (philosopher)|Li Zhuowu]] and Liu Zongzhou ({{lang-zh|t=[[:zh:劉宗周|劉宗周]]|labels=no}}). Wang Gen formed ''Taizhou School'' ({{lang-zh|t=[[:zh:泰州學派|泰州學派]]|labels=no}}), which went left of Wang Yangming's thought. During the late Ming period, Wang Yangming's thought became notably popular and influential in China.
Wang's interpretation of Confucianism has been influential in China into modern times.  The twentieth-century Chinese warlord [[Yan Xishan]] attempted to revive Confucianism in [[Shanxi]] largely on the model of Wang's philosophy.<ref>Gillin 60</ref>
The teachings of Wang Yangming were credited with inspiring many Japanese reformers and revolutionaries during the nineteenth century.  This led to a great increase in interest in his thought in Japan at the end of the [[Meiji period]], when many Chinese activists such as [[Liang Qichao]] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] were staying in Japan.  Some Chinese and Korean thinkers believed that Wang Yangming's teachings strongly influenced the development of modern [[bushido]] (the "way of the warrior") in Japan, and promoted both ethics in their countries to strengthen the spirit of their respective peoples.<ref>Benesch, 2009.</ref>

The Japanese Admiral of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], [[Tōgō Heihachirō]], was influenced by Wang, and made a stamp which read, "One's whole life followed the example of Yangming" ({{langx|ja|一生低首拜陽明}}). In Japan, many scholars and politicians (this group of people is known in Japanese as "Yōmeigakusha" ({{langx|ja|[[:ja:Category:陽明学者|陽明学者]]|link=no}}) came from Wang Yangming's school (''Ōyōmei-gaku'') in history, including [[Kumazawa Banzan]], [[Saigō Takamori]], [[Takasugi Shinsaku]] and [[Toju Nakae|Nakae Tōju]]. Toju Nakae is regarded as the founder of Japanese ''Ōyōmei-gaku''.

==Memorials==
[[File:陽明公園王陽明先生造像 20240807.jpg|thumb|Statue of Wang Yangming at [[Yangmingshan]], [[Taipei]].]]
[[Chiang Kai-shek]] named a national attraction in [[Taiwan]], [[Yangmingshan]], after Wang; and a road in [[Nanchang]] is also named ''Yangming Road'' after Wang by Chiang-influenced local officials. Additionally, [[National Yang-Ming University]] in Taiwan is also named after the philosopher.
People in [[Guiyang]], provincial capital of [[Guizhou]] Province, dedicated a statue to Wang Yangming as well as a museum and theme park; a robot version of Wang Yangming is in the city.<ref>{{cite news|author=Johnson, Ian|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/world/asia/china-guiyang-wang-yangming-confucian.html?ribbon-ad-idx=4&rref=world/asia&module=Ribbon&version=context&region=Header&action=click&contentCollection=Asia%20Pacific&pgtype=article|title=Forget Marx and Mao.

The city government in Wang's hometown, [[Yuyao]], [[Zhejiang]] Province, named a middle school after his honorific name.
