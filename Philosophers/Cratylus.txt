'''Cratylus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|æ|t|ɪ|l|ə|s}} {{respell|KRAT|il|əs}}; {{langx|grc|Κρατύλος}}, ''Kratylos'') was an [[History of Athens|ancient Athenian]] [[philosopher]] from the mid-late 5th century BC, known mostly through his portrayal in [[Plato]]'s [[Dialogues of Plato|dialogue]] ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]''. He was a radical proponent of [[Heraclitean]] philosophy and influenced the young Plato.

==Life==
Little is known of Cratylus beyond his status as a disciple of [[Heraclitus]] of [[Ephesus]], [[Asia Minor]]. Modern biographers have not reached consensus on his approximate date of birth, arguing alternately for an age comparable either to [[Plato]] or [[Socrates]].<ref name=nails>[[Debra Nails]]. ''The People of Plato: A prosopography of Plato and other Socratics''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002, p. 105</ref> Cratylus is mentioned in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' in a passage which seems to imply that he was an established and active philosopher in Athens during the mid-late 5th century,<ref name=nails /> and that Plato was briefly interested in his teachings prior to aligning with Socrates.

==Philosophy==
In Cratylus' eponymous Platonic dialogue, the character of Socrates states Heraclitus' claim that one cannot step twice into the same stream.<ref>Plato, ''Cratylus'', 402a</ref>  According to Aristotle, Cratylus went a step beyond his master's doctrine and proclaimed that it cannot even be done once.<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', 4.5 1010a10-15</ref>

==Influence==
The contemporary philosophy [[Cratylism]] is based on a reconstructed version of Cratylus' theories of flux and language as they appear in Plato's dialogue. It has been influential to Eastern thinkers, including [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[semiotics|semioticians]].<ref>[[Fabio Rambelli]]. ''A Buddhist Theory of Semiotics''. London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2013, p. 179</ref> The Australian poet, academic, and literary critic [[A. D. Hope|Professor A. D. Hope]] published in 1979 a book of essays on poetry titled ''The New Cratylus.''.<ref>''The New Cratylus: Notes on the Craft of Poetry'', Melbourne, Oxford University Press, 1979</ref>

Cratylus is mentioned twice in [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s 1961 book, ''[[Totality and Infinity|Totality And Infinity]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Levinas|first=Emmanuel|title=Totality And Infinity|publisher=Duquesne University Press|year=1969|isbn=978-0-8207-0245-2|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|pages=60, 92|translator-last=Lingis}}</ref>
