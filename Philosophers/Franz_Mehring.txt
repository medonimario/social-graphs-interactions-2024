== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Mehring was born 27 February 1846 in [[Slawno|Schlawe]], [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]], the son of a retired military officer and senior tax official.<ref name="Broue">{{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Broué |author-link=Pierre Broué |title=The German Revolution, 1917–1923 |orig-date=1971 |translator-first=John |translator-last=Archer |date=2006 |location=Chicago |publisher=[[Haymarket Books]] |page=977}}</ref> He studied classical philology at the [[Leipzig University|University of Leipzig]] and received his doctorate in 1882 with the dissertation: "The German social democracy, their history and their teaching".<ref>{{Citation |last=Höhle |first=Barbara |editor-first1=Barbara |editor-last1=Höhle |title=10 Spracherwerbstheorie: Wie kommt die Sprache zum Kind? |language=de |trans-title=10 Theory of language acquisition: How does language come to the child? |date=2012-09-19 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1524/9783050060149.141 |work=Psycholinguistik |pages=141–156 |place=Munich |publisher=[[De Gruyter]] |doi=10.1524/9783050060149.141 |isbn=9783050060149 |access-date=2021-12-14}}</ref>

=== Political career ===
Mehring worked for various daily and weekly newspapers and over many years wrote lead articles for the weekly magazine {{lang|de|[[Die Neue Zeit]]}}.

He was initially a supporter of [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] ideals and allied himself with the [[National liberalism|national-liberal]] camp, however after being acquainted with working-class leaders such as [[August Bebel]] and [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] Mehring gradually moved towards socialism.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=McDougall |first=Glen R. |date=1983 |title=Franz Mehring and the Problems of Liberal Social Reform in Bismarckian Germany 1884-90: The Origins of Radical Marxism |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4545988 |journal=Central European History |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=225–255 |doi=10.1017/S0008938900013947 |jstor=4545988 |s2cid=143623541 |issn=0008-9389}}</ref> 

In 1868, Mehring moved to Berlin to study and worked in the editorial office of the {{lang|de|Die Zukunft}} newspaper.

From 1871 to 1874, Mehring worked for the Correspondence Office in [[Oldenburg (city)|Oldenburg]], writing reports on sessions of the ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' and the local parliament. He became a well-known parliamentary reporter, working for the {{lang|de|[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]}} newspaper and {{lang|de|Die Waage}}, a newspaper published by [[Leopold Sonnemann]].

From time to time Mehring spoke in support of the labor movement, his views were initially close to [[Ferdinand Lassalle]]. In 1880, Mehring began to study the works of [[Karl Marx]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mayer |first=Gustav |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29648889 |title=Erinnerungen: vom Journalisten zum Historiker der deutschen Arbeiterbewegung |language=de |trans-title=Memories: from journalist to historian of the German labor movement |date=1993 |publisher=G. Olms |others=Gottfried Niedhart |isbn=3-487-09688-9 |location=Hildesheim |oclc=29648889}}</ref>

Mehring left {{lang|de|Die Waage}} after an argument with Sonnemann and in 1884 became chief editor of the {{lang|de|Berliner Volks-Zeitung}} newspaper. He spoke out against [[Otto von Bismarck]]’s [[Anti-Socialist Laws]], although he still was at the time himself close to liberal parties. In 1891, Mehring joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD).<ref name=":0" />

In 1893, Mehring was the recipient of a letter from [[Friedrich Engels]], in which the latter first wrote the phrase [[False consciousness]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Engels |first1=Friedrich |author1-link=Friedrich Engels |title=Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Selected Works in Two Volumes, Volume II |date=1949 |publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House |location=Moscow |page=451 |chapter=Letter to F. Mehring |quote=Ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process.}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=April 2021|reason=The letter can't be used to support the claim that this was the first use of the phrase.}}

Between 1902 and 1907, Mehring was the chief editor of the Social Democratic {{lang|de|[[Leipziger Volkszeitung]]}} newspaper.<ref name="Broue"/>

From 1906 to 1911, Mehring taught at the SPD's party school and was a member of the [[Prussian parliament]] from 1917 to 1918.

During [[World War I]], Mehring began to distance himself from the SPD, along with other members who believed the party was abandoning its Socialist Agenda by passing a bill to send more troops to war. In 1916, the left-wing [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Spartacus League]] was founded and Mehring was one of its main leaders alongside [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]].<ref name="Broue"/>

Mehring was sympathetic to the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] organization in Russia and to the cause of the [[October Revolution]].<ref name="Broue"/>

Mehring wrote a Marxist analysis of the actions of King [[Gustavus Adolphus]] of Sweden which rejected the official explanation of the [[Thirty Years' War]] as having been rooted in religion, arguing instead that the economic and social interests of various classes were the actual spurs to action. After "long and irritating delays owing to the military censorship" (according to the English translator Edward Fitzgerald, 1935 U.S. edition), Mehring's ''[[Karl Marx: The Story of His Life]]'' was published in 1918.<ref name="McLellan"/> The classical biography of Marx,<ref name="McLellan">{{cite book |last=McLellan |first=David |title=Karl Marx: A Biography |publisher=Papermac |location=London |year=1995 |page=444 |isbn=0-333-63947-2}}</ref> it was dedicated to fellow Spartacist [[Clara Zetkin]]. The book was later translated into many languages, including Russian (1920), Swedish (1921–1922), Danish (1922), Hungarian (1925), Japanese (1930), Spanish (1932), and English (1935).<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3AMarx+au%3AFranz+Mehring&fq=yr%3A1918..1940+%3E&qt=advanced&dblist=638 "WorldCat search"]. August 19, 2010.</ref>

=== Death and legacy ===
Already in ill health, Mehring was deeply affected by the death of his comrades [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]] in January 1919.<ref name="Broue" /> He died just under two weeks later on 28 January 1919 in [[Berlin]] at the age of 73. His grave now forms part of the ''Memorial to the Socialists'' ({{langx|de|Gedenkstätte der Sozialisten}}) in the [[Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde|Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery]], [[Berlin]].
