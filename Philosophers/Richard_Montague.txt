'''Richard Merritt Montague''' (September 20, 1930 – March 7, 1971) was an [[Americans|American]] [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] who made contributions to [[mathematical logic]] and the [[philosophy of language]]. He is known for proposing [[Montague grammar]] to formalize the semantics of [[natural language]]. As a student of [[Alfred Tarski]], he also contributed early developments to [[Set theory|axiomatic set theory]] ([[ZFC]]). For the latter half of his life, he was a professor at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] until his early death, believed to be a [[homicide]], at age 40.

==Career==
At the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Montague earned a BA in philosophy in 1950, an MA in mathematics in 1953, and a [[PhD]] in Philosophy in 1957, the latter under the direction of the mathematician and logician [[Alfred Tarski]]. Montague spent his entire career teaching in the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy]], where he supervised the dissertations of [[Nino Cocchiarella]] and [[Hans Kamp]].

Montague wrote on the foundations of [[logic]] and [[set theory]], as would befit a student of Tarski. His PhD dissertation, titled ''Contributions to the Axiomatic Foundations of Set Theory'',<ref>{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Montague |first=Richard Merritt |date=June 1957 |title=Contributions to the axiomatic foundations of set theory |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url=http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b13106911~S1}}</ref> contained the first proof that all possible axiomatizations of the standard [[Set theory|axiomatic set theory]] [[ZFC]] must contain infinitely many axioms. In other words, ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.

He pioneered a logical approach to natural language [[semantics]] that became known as [[Montague grammar]]. This approach to language has been especially influential among certain [[computational linguist]]s—perhaps more so than among more traditional [[Philosophy of Language|philosophers of language]]. In particular, Montague's influence lives on in grammar approaches like [[categorial grammar]] (such as Unification Categorial Grammar, Left-Associative Grammar, or [[Combinatory categorial grammar|Combinatory Categorial Grammar]]), which attempt a derivation of syntactic and semantic representation in tandem and the semantics of quantifiers, scope and discourse ([[Hans Kamp]], a student of Montague's, co-developed [[Discourse Representation Theory]]).

Montague was an accomplished organist and a successful real estate investor. He died violently in his own home; the crime is unsolved to this day. [[Anita Feferman]] and [[Solomon Feferman]] argue that he usually went to bars "cruising" and bringing people home with him.<ref name="Feferman04">Feferman and Feferman 2004: 332-3</ref> On the day that he was murdered, he brought home several people "for some kind of soirée", but they strangled him.<ref name="Feferman04"/>

==In popular culture==
Three novels have been inspired by the life and death of Richard M. Montague:

*''[[The Mad Man]]'' by American science fiction author [[Samuel R. Delany]] (1994)
* ''Less Than Meets the Eye'' by American philosopher [[David Berlinski]] (1994)
* ''The Semantics of Murder'' by Irish writer [[Aifric Campbell]] (2008)
