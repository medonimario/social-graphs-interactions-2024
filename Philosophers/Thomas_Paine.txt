Common practice was to use a dash or a slash to separate the old-style year from the new-style year. In the old calendar, the new year began on March 25, not January 1. Paine's birth date, therefore, would have been before New Year, 1737. In the new style, his birth date advances by eleven days and his year increases by one to February 9, 1737.

Paine was born in [[Thetford]], Norfolk, and immigrated to the [[Thirteen Colonies|British American colonies]] in 1774 with the help of [[Benjamin Franklin]], arriving just in time to participate in the American Revolution. Virtually every American Patriot read his 47-page pamphlet ''Common Sense'',<ref name=Hitchens /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine and the Promise of America|author=Kaye, Harvey J.|author-link=Harvey J.

The equivalent sales today would be fifteen million, making it, proportionally, the nation's greatest best-seller ever."}}</ref> which catalyzed the call for independence from Great Britain. ''The American Crisis'' was a pro-independence pamphlet series. Paine lived in France for most of the 1790s, becoming deeply involved in the [[French Revolution]]. While in England, he wrote ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791), in part a defense of the French Revolution against its critics, particularly the Anglo-Irish conservative writer [[Edmund Burke]]. His authorship of the tract led to [[Trial of Thomas Paine|a trial and conviction]] ''in absentia'' in England in 1792 for the crime of [[seditious libel]].

The British government of [[William Pitt the Younger]] was worried by the possibility that the French Revolution might spread to Britain and had begun suppressing works that espoused radical philosophies. Paine's work advocated the right of the people to overthrow their government and was therefore targeted with a writ for his arrest issued in early 1792. Paine fled to France in September, despite not being able to speak French, but he was quickly elected to the French [[National Convention]]. The [[Girondins]] regarded him as an ally; consequently, the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]] regarded him as an enemy, especially [[Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier]], the powerful president of the [[Committee of General Security]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Lessay |first=Jean |title=L' Américain de la convention: Thomas Paine, professeur de révolutions, député du Pas-de-Calais |date=1987 |publisher=Libr.

He completed the first part of ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' just before he was arrested. Mark Philp notes that "In prison Paine managed to produce (and to convey to Daniel Isaac Eaton, the radical London publisher) a dedication for ''The Age of Reason'' and a new edition of the ''Rights of Man'' with a new preface." [[James Monroe]] used his diplomatic connections to get Paine released in November 1794.<ref>https://www.oxforddnb.com/display/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-21133</ref>

Paine became notorious because of his pamphlets and attacks on his former allies, who he felt had betrayed him. In ''The Age of Reason'' and other writings, he advocated [[Deism]], promoted reason and [[freethought]], and argued against religion in general and Christian doctrine in particular.<ref name="Paine 2014">{{cite book |last=Paine |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Paine |year=2014 |chapter=Of the Religion of Deism Compared with the Christian Religion, and the Superiority of the Former over the Latter (1804) |chapter-url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/paine-deism.asp |editor1-last=Calvert |editor1-first=Jane E. |editor2-last=Shapiro |editor2-first=Ian |title=Selected Writings of Thomas Paine |location=[[New Haven]] |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |series=Rethinking the Western Tradition |doi=10.12987/9780300210699-018 |pages=568–574 |isbn=978-0300167450 |s2cid=246141428 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827161516/https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/paine-deism.asp |archive-date=27 August 2016 |access-date=7 August 2021}}</ref><ref name="Fischer 2010">{{cite journal |last=Fischer |first=Kirsten |date=2010 |title='Religion Governed by Terror': A Deist Critique of Fearful Christianity in the Early American Republic |editor1-last=Manning |editor1-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Stefani |editor2-first=Anne |journal=Revue Française d'Études Américaines |location=[[Paris]] |publisher=Belin |volume=125 |issue=3 |pages=13–26 |doi=10.3917/rfea.125.0013 |doi-access=free |eissn=1776-3061 |issn=0397-7870 |lccn=80640131 |via=[[Cairn.info]]}}</ref><ref name="Gelpi 2007">{{cite book |last=Gelpi |first=Donald L. |year=2007 |orig-year=2000 |chapter=Part 1: Enlightenment Religion – Chapter 3: Militant Deism |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hB1KAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA47 |title=Varieties of Transcendental Experience: A Study in Constructive Postmodernism |location=[[Eugene, Oregon]] |publisher=[[Wipf and Stock]] |pages=47–48 |isbn=9781725220294 |access-date=January 22, 2023 |archive-date=January 22, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230122122123/https://books.google.com/books?id=hB1KAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA47 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Claeys 1989">{{cite book |last=Claeys |first=Gregory |year=1989 |title=Thomas Paine: Social and Political Thought |chapter=Revolution in heaven: The Age of Reason (1794–95) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9X9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA177 |location=[[New York City|New York]] and [[London]] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |edition=1st |pages=177–195 |isbn=978-0044450900 |access-date=December 23, 2021 |archive-date=December 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230042958/https://books.google.com/books?id=W9X9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA177#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1796, he published a bitter open letter to [[George Washington]], whom he denounced as an incompetent general and a hypocrite.

On September 27, 1759, Paine married Mary Lambert. His business collapsed soon after. Mary became pregnant; and, after they moved to [[Margate]], she went into early labour, in which she and their child died.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/paine.html|title=Thomas Paine, 1737–1809|website=historyguide.org|access-date=March 28, 2019|archive-date=March 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190317031239/http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/paine.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In July 1761, Paine returned to Thetford to work as a [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] officer. In December 1762, he became an [[HM Customs and Excise|Excise Officer]] in [[Grantham]], Lincolnshire; in August 1764, he was transferred to [[Alford, Lincolnshire|Alford]], also in Lincolnshire, at a salary of £50 per annum. On August 27, 1765, he was dismissed as an Excise Officer for "claiming to have inspected goods he did not inspect". On July 31, 1766, he requested his reinstatement from the Board of Excise, which they granted the next day, upon vacancy. While awaiting that, he worked as a staymaker.<ref>{{Cite web

Paine first became involved in civic matters when he was based in Lewes. He appears in the Town Book as a member of the Court Leet, the governing body for the town. He was also a member of the [[parish]] [[vestry]], an influential local Anglican church group whose responsibilities for parish business would include collecting taxes and tithes to distribute among the poor. On March 26, 1771, at age 34, Paine married Elizabeth Ollive, the daughter of his recently deceased landlord, whose business as a grocer and tobacconist he then entered into.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMm_JGPkmLkC&q=Elizabeth%20Ollive%20married%20Thomas%20Paine%20on%20March%2026%201771&pg=PA12|title=The Life of Thomas Paine, Author of "Common Sense," "Rights of Man," "Age of Reason," "Letters to the Addresser[!]," &c., &c|last=Rickman|first=Thomas Clio|author-link=Thomas 'Clio' Rickman|date=1899| oclc=424874|publisher=B.D.

From 1772 to 1773, Paine joined excise officers asking Parliament for better pay and working conditions, publishing, in summer of 1772, ''The Case of the Officers of Excise'', a 12-page article, and his first political work, spending the London winter distributing the 4,000 copies printed to the Parliament and others. In spring 1774, he was again dismissed from the excise service for being absent from his post without permission. The tobacco shop failed. On April 14, to avoid [[debtors' prison]], he sold his household possessions to pay debts. He formally separated from his wife Elizabeth on June 4, 1774, and moved to London. In September, mathematician, Fellow of the Royal Society, and Commissioner of the Excise [[George Lewis Scott]] introduced him to [[Benjamin Franklin]],<ref>"Letter to the Honorable Henry Laurens" in Philip S. Foner's ''The Complete Writings of Thomas Paine'' (New York: Citadel Press, 1945), 2:1160–1165.</ref> who was there as a voice for colonial opposition to British colonial rule, especially as it related to the [[Stamp Act (1765)|Stamp Act]], and the [[Townshend Acts]]. He was publisher and editor of the largest American newspaper, ''[[The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' and suggested emigration to Philadelphia. He handed out a letter of recommendation to Paine, who emigrated in October to the American colonies, arriving in [[Philadelphia]] on November 30, 1774.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Paine|title=Thomas Paine {{!}} British-American author|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=September 15, 2017|date=|archive-date=September 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915162723/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Paine|url-status=live}}</ref>

Paine barely survived the transatlantic voyage. The ship's water supplies were bad and [[typhoid fever]] killed five passengers. On arriving at Philadelphia, he was too sick to disembark. Benjamin Franklin's physician, there to welcome Paine to America, had him carried off ship; Paine took six weeks to recover. He became a citizen of Pennsylvania "by taking the oath of allegiance at a very early period".<ref>Conway, Moncure Daniel, 1892. ''The Life of Thomas Paine'' vol. 1, p. 209.</ref> In March 1775, he became editor of the ''Pennsylvania Magazine'', a position he conducted with considerable ability.<ref name="larkin3140">{{cite book |last1=Larkin |first1=Edward |title=Thomas Paine and the Literature of Revolution |date=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=31–40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u5z2iRUemxMC |access-date=December 1, 2018 |isbn=978-1139445986 |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204235328/https://books.google.com/books?id=u5z2iRUemxMC |url-status=live }}</ref>

Before Paine's arrival in America, sixteen magazines had been founded in the colonies and ultimately failed, each featuring substantial content and reprints from England. In late 1774, Philadelphia printer [[Robert Aitken (publisher)|Robert Aitken]] announced his plan to create what he called an "American Magazine" with content derived from the colonies.<ref name="larkin3140" /> Paine contributed two pieces to the magazine's inaugural issue dated January 1775, and Aitken hired Paine as the Magazine's editor one month later. Under Paine's leadership, the magazine's readership rapidly expanded, achieving a greater circulation in the colonies than any American magazine up until that point.<ref name="larkin3140" /> While Aitken had conceived of the magazine as nonpolitical, Paine brought a strong political perspective to its content, writing in its first issue that "every heart and hand seem to be engaged in the interesting struggle for ''American Liberty.''"<ref name="larkin3140" />

Paine wrote in the ''Pennsylvania Magazine'' that such a publication should become a "nursery of genius" for a nation that had "now outgrown the state of infancy," exercising and educating American minds, and shaping American morality.<ref name="larkin3140" /> On March 8, 1775, the ''Pennsylvania Magazine'' published an unsigned abolitionist essay titled ''African Slavery in America''.<ref name="LoA" /> The essay is often attributed to Paine on the basis of a letter by [[Benjamin Rush]], recalling Paine's claim of authorship to the essay.<ref name="LoA">{{cite book |title=American Antislavery Writings: Colonial Beginnings to Emancipation |date=2012 |publisher=Library of America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JuG3IKMYdIYC |access-date=December 1, 2018 |isbn=978-1598532142 |archive-date=August 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819133421/https://books.google.com/books?id=JuG3IKMYdIYC |url-status=live }}</ref> The essay attacked slavery as an "execrable commerce" and "outrage against Humanity and Justice."<ref name="LoA" />

Consciously appealing to a broader and more working-class audience, Paine also used the magazine to discuss worker rights to production. This shift in the conceptualization of politics has been described as a part of "the 'modernization' of political consciousness," and the mobilization of ever greater sections of society into political life.<ref name="larkin3140" /><ref name="jpgreen">{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Jack |title=Paine, America, and the "Modernization" of Political Consciousness |journal=Political Science Quarterly |date=1978 |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=73–92 |doi=10.2307/2149051 |jstor=2149051  |issn = 0032-3195}}</ref>

It was published in [[Philadelphia]] on January 10, 1776, and signed anonymously "by an Englishman". It was an immediate success, with Paine estimating it sold 100,000 copies in three months to the two million residents of the 13 colonies. During the course of the American Revolution, one biographer estimated a total of about 500,000 copies were sold, including unauthorized editions.<ref name=Hitchens>{{Cite book

It was passed around and often read aloud in taverns, contributing significantly to spreading the idea of republicanism, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Britain, and encouraging recruitment for the [[Continental Army]]. Paine provided a new and convincing argument for independence by advocating a complete break with history. ''Common Sense'' is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice.

Paine's attack on monarchy in ''Common Sense'' is essentially an attack on [[George III]]. Whereas colonial resentments were originally directed primarily against the king's ministers and Parliament, Paine laid the responsibility firmly at the king's door. ''Common Sense'' was the most widely read pamphlet of the American Revolution. It was a clarion call for unity against the corrupt British court, so as to realize America's providential role in providing an asylum for liberty. Written in a direct and lively style, it denounced the decaying despotisms of Europe and pilloried hereditary monarchy as an absurdity. At a time when many still hoped for reconciliation with Britain, ''Common Sense'' demonstrated to many the inevitability of separation.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Thomas Paine|author=Philp, Mark|author-link=Mark Philp|editor=Edward N.

Paine was not on the whole expressing original ideas in ''Common Sense'', but rather employing rhetoric as a means to arouse resentment of the Crown. To achieve these ends, he pioneered a style of political writing suited to the democratic society he envisioned, with ''Common Sense'' serving as a primary example. Part of Paine's work was to render complex ideas intelligible to average readers of the day, with clear, concise writing unlike the formal, learned style favored by many of Paine's contemporaries.<ref>Merrill Jensen, ''The Founding of a Nation: A History of the American Revolution, 1763–1776'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1968), 668.</ref> Scholars have put forward various explanations to account for its success, including the historic moment, Paine's easy-to-understand style, his democratic ethos, and his use of psychology and ideology.<ref>David C. Hoffman, "Paine and Prejudice: Rhetorical Leadership through Perceptual Framing in Common Sense." ''Rhetoric and Public Affairs'', Fall 2006, Vol. 9, Issue 3, pp. 373–410.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

''Common Sense'' was immensely popular in disseminating to a very wide audience ideas that were already in common use among the elite who comprised Congress and the leadership cadre of the emerging nation, who rarely cited Paine's arguments in their public calls for independence.<ref>Pauline Maier, ''American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence'' (New York: Knopf, 1997), 90–91.</ref> The pamphlet probably had little direct influence on the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress']] decision to issue a [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], since that body was more concerned with how declaring independence would affect the war effort.<ref>Jack N. Rakove, ''The Beginnings of National Politics: An Interpretive History of the Continental Congress'' (New York: Knopf, 1979), 89.</ref> One distinctive idea in ''Common Sense'' is Paine's beliefs regarding the peaceful nature of republics; his views were an early and strong conception of what scholars would come to call the [[democratic peace theory]].<ref>Jack S. Levy, William R. Thompson, ''Causes of War'' (John Wiley & Sons, 2011).</ref>

[[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] vigorously attacked ''Common Sense''; one attack, titled ''Plain Truth'' (1776), by Marylander [[James Chalmers (loyalist)|James Chalmers]], said Paine was a political quack<ref>{{Cite web

Adams disagreed with the type of radical democracy promoted by Paine (that men who did not own property should still be allowed to vote and hold public office) and published ''[[Thoughts on Government]]'' in 1776 to advocate a more conservative approach to republicanism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.masshist.org/publications/adams-papers/index.php/view/PJA04dg2|title=Adams Papers Digital Edition – Massachusetts Historical Society|website=www.masshist.org|access-date=December 5, 2018|archive-date=December 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205150155/http://www.masshist.org/publications/adams-papers/index.php/view/PJA04dg2|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Sophia Rosenfeld]] argues that Paine was highly innovative in his use of the commonplace notion of "common sense". He synthesized various philosophical and political uses of the term in a way that permanently impacted American political thought. He used two ideas from [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]]: that ordinary people can indeed make sound judgments on major political issues, and that there exists a body of popular wisdom that is readily apparent to anyone. Paine also used a notion of "common sense" favored by [[philosophe]]s in the Continental Enlightenment. They held that common sense could refute the claims of traditional institutions. Thus, Paine used "common sense" as a weapon to de-legitimize the monarchy and overturn prevailing conventional wisdom. Rosenfeld concludes that the phenomenal appeal of his pamphlet resulted from his synthesis of popular and elite elements in the independence movement.<ref>{{cite journal|author1-link=Sophia Rosenfeld|jstor=40212021|title=Tom Paine's Common Sense and Ours|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|volume=65|issue=4|pages=633–668|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Sophia|year=2008}}</ref>

According to historian [[Robert Middlekauff]], ''Common Sense'' became immensely popular mainly because Paine appealed to widespread convictions. Monarchy, he said, was preposterous and it had a heathenish origin. It was an institution of the devil. Paine pointed to the [[Old Testament]], where almost all kings had seduced the Israelites to worship idols instead of God. Paine also denounced aristocracy, which together with monarchy were "two ancient tyrannies." They violated the laws of nature, human reason, and the "universal order of things," which began with God. That was, Middlekauff says, exactly what most Americans wanted to hear. He calls the Revolutionary generation "the children of the twice-born".<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005).

=== Possible involvement in drafting the Declaration of Independence ===
[[File:Roger Sherman Copy of the Declaration of Independence.jpg|thumb|The [[Committee of Five]] working draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], dated June 24, 1776, copied from the original draft by [[John Adams]] for [[Roger Sherman]]'s review and approval]]
[[File:Sherman copy inscription referencing Thomas Paine.jpg|thumb|Inscription on reverse of Sherman Copy of the Declaration of Independence referencing "T.P." during the drafting process]]While there is no historical record of Paine's involvement in drafting the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], some scholars of Early American History have suspected his involvement. As noted by the Thomas Paine National Historical Association, multiple authors have hypothesized and written on the subject, including Moody (1872), Van der Weyde (1911), Lewis (1947), and more recently, Smith & Rickards (2007).<ref name=":1" />

In 2018, the Thomas Paine National Historical Association introduced an early draft of the Declaration that contained evidence of Paine's involvement based on an inscription of "T.P." on the back of the document. During the early deliberations of the [[Committee of Five]] members chosen by Congress to draft the Declaration of Independence, [[John Adams]] made a hastily written manuscript copy of the original draft of the Declaration of Independence on June 24, 1776, known as the Sherman Copy. Adams made this copy shortly before preparing another neater, fair copy that is held in the Adams Family Papers collection at the Massachusetts Historical Society. The Sherman copy of the Declaration of Independence is one of several working drafts of the Declaration, made for [[Roger Sherman]]'s review and approval before the Committee of Five submitted a finalized draft to Congress. The Sherman Copy of the Declaration of Independence contains an inscription on the back of the document that states: "A beginning perhaps-Original with Jefferson-Copied from Original with T.P.'s permission." According to the Thomas Paine National Historical Association, the individual referenced as "T.P." in the inscription appears to be Thomas Paine.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Thomas Paine National Historical Association |url=https://thomaspaine.org/pages/resources/sherman-copy-di.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210403151531/http://www.thomaspaine.org/aboutpaine/sherman-copy-di.html |archive-date=April 3, 2021 |access-date=2021-03-17 |website=www.thomaspaine.org}}</ref>

The degree to which Paine was involved in formulating the text of the Declaration is unclear, as the original draft referenced in the Sherman Copy inscription is presumed lost or destroyed. However, John Adams' request for permission of "T.P." to copy the original draft may suggest that Paine had a role either assisting Jefferson with organizing ideas within the Declaration, or contributing to the text of the original draft itself.<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373951532_Uncovering_the_Trail_of_Communication_of_the_Committee_of_Five_Roger_Sherman's_Draft_Copy_of_the_Declaration_of_Independence</ref>

===''The American Crisis'' (1776)===
In late 1776, Paine published ''[[The American Crisis]]'' pamphlet series to inspire the Americans in their battles against the British army. He juxtaposed the conflict between the good American devoted to civic virtue and the selfish provincial man.<ref>Martin Roth, "Tom Paine and American Loneliness." ''Early American Literature,'' September 1987, Vol. 22, Issue 2, pp. 175–182.</ref> To inspire his soldiers, General [[George Washington]] had ''The American Crisis'', first ''Crisis'' pamphlet, read aloud to them.<ref>{{Cite web

What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.}}

===Foreign affairs===
In 1777, Paine became secretary of the Congressional Committee on Foreign Affairs. The following year, he alluded to secret negotiation underway with France in his pamphlets. His enemies denounced his indiscretions. There was scandal; together with Paine's conflict with [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] and [[Silas Deane]], it led to Paine's expulsion from the Committee in 1779.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine: Enlightenment, Revolution, and the Birth of Modern Nations|last=Nelson|first=Craig|year=2007|publisher=Penguin|pages=174–175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRFql6S6jKgC&pg=PT174|isbn=978-1101201787|access-date=July 1, 2015|archive-date=September 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904024401/https://books.google.com/books?id=xRFql6S6jKgC&pg=PT174|url-status=live}}</ref>

However, in 1781, he accompanied [[John Laurens]] on his mission to France. Eventually, after much pleading from Paine, New York State recognized his political services by presenting him with an estate at [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], New York and Paine received money from Pennsylvania and from Congress at Washington's suggestion. During the Revolutionary War, Paine served as an aide-de-camp to the important general, [[Nathanael Greene]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crisis in representation: Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Helen Maria Williams, and the rewriting of the French Revolution|last=Blakemore|first=Steve|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year=1997}}</ref>

====Silas Deane Affair====

In what may have been an error, and perhaps even contributed to his resignation as the secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Paine was openly critical of Silas Deane, an American diplomat who had been appointed in March 1776 by the Congress to travel to France in secret. Deane's goal was to influence the French government to finance the colonists in their fight for independence. Paine largely saw Deane as a war profiteer who had little respect for principle, having been under the employ of Robert Morris, one of the primary financiers of the American Revolution and working with [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], a French royal agent sent to the colonies by King Louis to investigate the Anglo-American conflict. Paine uncovered the financial connection between Morris, who was Superintendent for Finance of the Continental Congress, and Deane.<ref name="Harlow Giles Unger 2019 p. 89">[[Harlow Giles Unger]], "Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence," (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), p. 89</ref>

Wealthy men, such as Robert Morris, [[John Jay]] and powerful [[merchant bank]]ers, were leaders of the Continental Congress and defended holding public positions while at the same time profiting off their own personal financial dealings with governments.<ref name="Harlow Giles Unger 2019 p. 89"/> Amongst Paine's criticisms, he had written in the ''[[Pennsylvania Packet]]'' that France had "''prefaced [their] alliance by an early and generous friendship''," referring to aid that had been provided to American colonies prior to the recognition of the Franco-American treaties. This was alleged to be effectively an embarrassment to France, which potentially could have jeopardized the alliance. John Jay, the President of the Congress, who had been a fervent supporter of Deane, immediately spoke out against Paine's comments. The controversy eventually became public, and Paine was then denounced as unpatriotic for criticizing an American revolutionary. He was even physically assaulted twice in the street by Deane supporters. This much-added stress took a large toll on Paine, who was generally of a sensitive character and he resigned as secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs in 1779.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine|author=Craig Nelson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/thomaspaineenlig0000nels/page/134 134–138]|isbn=978-0670037889|year=2006|url=https://archive.org/details/thomaspaineenlig0000nels/page/134|publisher=New York : Viking}}</ref> Paine left the Committee without even having enough money to buy food for himself.<ref>Harlow Giles Unger, "Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence," (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), p. 93</ref>

Much later, when Paine returned from his mission to France, Deane's corruption had become more widely acknowledged. Many, including Robert Morris, apologized to Paine, and Paine's reputation in Philadelphia was restored.<ref>Harlow Giles Unger, "Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence," (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), pp. 102–103</ref>

==="Public Good"===

In 1780, Paine published a pamphlet entitled "Public Good," in which he made the case that territories west of the 13 colonies that had been part of the British Empire belonged after the Declaration of Independence to the American government, and did not belong to any of the 13 states or to any individual [[land speculation|speculators]]. A [[royal charter]] of 1609 had granted to the [[Virginia Company]] land stretching to the Pacific Ocean. A small group of wealthy Virginia land speculators, including the Washington, Lee, and Randolph families, had taken advantage of this royal charter to survey and to claim title to huge swaths of land, including much land west of the 13 colonies. In "Public Good," Paine argued that these lands belonged to the American government as represented by the Continental Congress. This angered many of Paine's wealthy Virginia friends, including [[Richard Henry Lee]] of the powerful Lee family, who had been Paine's closest ally in Congress, [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], all of whom had claims to huge wild tracts that Paine was advocating should be government owned. The view that Paine had advocated eventually prevailed when the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 was passed.

The animosity Paine felt as a result of the publication of "Public Good" fueled his decision to embark with [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John Laurens]] on a mission to travel to Paris to obtain funding for the American war effort.<ref>Harlow Giles Unger, "Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence," (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), pp. 100–101</ref>

===Funding the Revolution===
Paine accompanied Col. John Laurens to France and is credited with initiating the mission.<ref>Daniel Wheeler's ''Life and Writings of Thomas Paine'' Vol. 1 (1908) pp. 26–27.</ref> It landed in France in March 1781 and returned to America in August with 2.5 million [[French livre|livres]] in silver, as part of a "present" of 6 million and a loan of 10&nbsp;million. The meetings with the French king were most likely conducted in the company and under the influence of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Upon returning to the United States with this highly welcomed cargo, Paine and probably Col. Laurens, "positively objected" that General Washington should propose that Congress remunerate him for his services, for fear of setting "a bad precedent and an improper mode". Paine made influential acquaintances in Paris and helped organize the [[Bank of North America]] to raise money to supply the army.<ref>Daniel Wheeler, ''Life and Writings of Thomas Paine'' Vol. 1 (1908), p. 314.</ref> In 1785, he was given $3,000 by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in recognition of his service to the nation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Common Sense and Other Writings|author=Paine, Thomas|year=2005|publisher=Barnes & Noble Classics|page=[https://archive.org/details/commonsenseother0000pain/page/ xiii]|isbn=978-0672600043|url=https://archive.org/details/commonsenseother0000pain/page/}}</ref>

[[Henry Laurens]] (father of Col. [[John Laurens]]) had been the ambassador to the [[Netherlands]], but he was captured by the British on his return trip there. When he was later exchanged for the prisoner [[Lord Cornwallis]] in late 1781, Paine proceeded to the Netherlands to continue the loan negotiations. There remains some question as to the relationship of Henry Laurens and Paine to Robert Morris as the Superintendent of Finance and his business associate, Thomas Willing, who became the first president of the Bank of North America in January 1782. They had accused Morris of profiteering in 1779 and Willing had voted against the Declaration of Independence. Although Morris did much to restore his reputation in 1780 and 1781, the credit for obtaining these critical loans to "organize" the Bank of North America for approval by Congress in December 1781 should go to Henry or John Laurens and Paine more than to Morris.<ref name="Paine1824"/>

Paine bought his only house in 1783 on the corner of Farnsworth Avenue and Church Streets in [[Bordentown, New Jersey|Bordentown City]], New Jersey and he lived in it periodically until his death in 1809.

In 1787, Paine proposed a iron bridge design for crossing the [[Schuylkill River]] at Philadelphia. Having little success in acquiring funding, Paine returned to Paris, France seeking investors or other opportunities to implement his, at the time, novel iron bridge design.{{cn|date=October 2024}} Because Paine had few friends when arriving in France aside from [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] and Jefferson, he continued to correspond heavily with Benjamin Franklin, a long time friend and mentor. Franklin provided letters of introduction for Paine to use to gain associates and contacts in France.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Paine and Jefferson in the Age of Revolutions|last=Ziesche|first=Philipp|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2013|page=124}}{{ISBN?}}</ref>

Later that year, Paine returned to London from Paris. He then released a pamphlet on August 20 called ''Prospects on the Rubicon: or, an investigation into the Causes and Consequences of the Politics to be Agitated at the Meeting of Parliament''. Tensions between England and France were increasing, and this pamphlet urged the British Ministry to reconsider the consequences of war with France. Paine sought to turn the public opinion against the war to create better relations between the countries, avoid the taxes of war upon the citizens, and not engage in a war he believed would ruin both nations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Man Of Reason: The Life Of Thomas Paine|last=Aldridge|first=Alfred|publisher=J.

Back in London by 1787, Paine would become engrossed in the French Revolution that began two years later and decided to travel to France in 1790. Meanwhile, conservative intellectual [[Edmund Burke]] launched a counterrevolutionary blast against the French Revolution, entitled ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), which strongly appealed to the landed class, and sold 30,000 copies. Paine set out to refute it in his ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791). He wrote it not as a quick pamphlet, but as a long, abstract political tract of 90,000 words which tore apart monarchies and traditional social institutions. On January 31, 1791, he gave the manuscript to publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]]. A visit by government agents dissuaded Johnson, so Paine gave the book to publisher J. S. Jordan, then went to Paris, on [[William Blake]]'s advice. He charged three good friends, [[William Godwin]], [[Thomas Brand Hollis]], and [[Thomas Holcroft]], with handling publication details. The book appeared on March 13, 1791, and sold nearly a million copies. It was "eagerly read by reformers, Protestant dissenters, democrats, London craftsmen, and the skilled factory-hands of the new industrial north".<ref>George Rudé, ''Revolutionary Europe: 1783–1815'' (1964), p. 183.{{ISBN?}}</ref>

Undeterred by the government campaign to discredit him, Paine issued his ''Rights of Man, Part the Second, Combining Principle and Practice'' in February 1792. Detailing a representative government with enumerated social programs to remedy the numbing poverty of commoners through [[progressive tax]] measures, Paine went much farther than such contemporaries as [[James Burgh]], Robert Potter, John Scott, John Sinclair or [[Adam Smith]].<ref>Chiu, Frances A. ''The Routledge Guidebook to Paine's Rights of Man''. Routledge, 2020, pp. 203–247.</ref> Radically reduced in price to ensure unprecedented circulation, it was sensational in its impact and gave birth to reform societies. An indictment for [[seditious libel]] followed, for both publisher and author, while government agents followed Paine and instigated mobs, hate meetings, and burnings in effigy. A fierce pamphlet war also resulted, in which Paine was defended and assailed in dozens of works.<ref>Many of these are reprinted in ''Political Writings of the 1790s'', ed. G. Claeys (8 vols, London: Pickering and Chatto, 1995).{{ISBN?}}</ref> The authorities aimed, with ultimate success, to force Paine out of Great Britain. He was then [[Trial in absentia|tried ''in absentia'']] and found guilty, but he was beyond the reach of British law. The French translation of ''Rights of Man, Part II'' was published in April 1792. The translator, François Lanthenas, eliminated the dedication to Lafayette, as he believed Paine thought too highly of Lafayette, who was seen as a royalist sympathizer at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cosmopolitan Patriots: Americans in Paris in the Age of Revolution|last=Ziesche|first=Phillipp|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2010|page=63}}</ref>

In summer of 1792, he answered the sedition and libel charges thus: "If, to expose the fraud and imposition of monarchy ... to promote universal peace, civilization, and commerce, and to break the chains of political superstition, and raise degraded man to his proper rank; if these things be libellous ... let the name of libeller be engraved on my tomb."<ref>Thomas Paine, Letter Addressed To The Addressers On The Late Proclamation, in Michael Foot, Isaac Kramnick (ed.), The Thomas Paine Reader, p. 374 {{ISBN?}}</ref>

Paine was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution and was granted honorary French [[citizenship]] alongside prominent contemporaries such as [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[George Washington]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and others. Paine's honorary citizenship was in recognition of the publishing of his ''Rights of Man, Part II'' and the sensation it created within France.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cosmopolitan Patriots: Americans in Paris in the Age of Revolution|last=Ziesche|first=Philipp|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2010|page=62}}</ref> Despite his inability to speak French, he was elected to the [[National Convention]], representing the district of [[Pas-de-Calais]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Political Philosophy of Thomas Paine|last=Fruchtman|first=Jack|year=2009|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801892844/page/192 192]|isbn=978-0801892844|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801892844/page/192}}</ref>

Several weeks after his election to the National Convention, Paine was selected as one of nine deputies to be part of the convention's Constitutional Committee, charged to draft a suitable constitution for the [[French Republican Calendar|French Republic]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Paine and Jefferson in the Age of Revolutions|last=Munck|first=Thomas|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2013|page=165}}</ref> He subsequently participated in the Constitutional Committee in drafting the [[Girondin constitutional project]]. He voted for the French Republic, but argued against the execution of [[trial of Louis XVI|Louis XVI]], referred to as Louis Capet following his deposition, saying the monarch should instead be [[exile]]d to the United States: firstly, because of the way royalist France had come to the aid of the American Revolution; and secondly, because of a moral objection to capital punishment in general and to revenge killings in particular.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Vincent|first=Bernard|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60158208|title=The transatlantic republican : Thomas Paine and the age of revolutions|date=2005|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=1417591021|location=Amsterdam|oclc=60158208|access-date=February 21, 2021|archive-date=May 27, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210527174925/https://www.worldcat.org/title/transatlantic-republican-thomas-paine-and-the-age-of-revolutions/oclc/60158208|url-status=live}}</ref> Paine's speech in defense of Louis XVI was interrupted by [[Jean-Paul Marat]], who claimed that, as a Quaker, Paine's religious beliefs ran counter to inflicting capital punishment and thus he should be ineligible to vote.

Paine wrote the second part of ''[[Rights of Man]]'' on a desk in [[Thomas 'Clio' Rickman]]'s house, with whom he was staying in 1792 before he fled to France. This desk is currently on display in the [[People's History Museum]] in [[Manchester]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Collection highlights, Tom Paine's Desk|publisher=People's History Museum|url=http://www.phm.org.uk/our-collection/tom-paines-desk|access-date=January 13, 2015|archive-date=January 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113172217/http://www.phm.org.uk/our-collection/tom-paines-desk/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Regarded as an ally of the [[Girondist|Girondins]], he was seen with increasing disfavor by the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]], who were now in power. Paine was under scrutiny by the authorities also because he was a personal adversary of [[Gouverneur Morris]], who was the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to France|American ambassador in France]] and a friend of [[George Washington]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last=Sagnac |first=Philippe |date=1900 |title=Moncure Daniel Conway, Thomas Paine (1737-1809) et la Révolution dans les deux mondes, Paris, 1900 (in French) |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/rhmc_0996-2743_1900_num_2_4_4185_t1_0429_0000_1 |journal=Revue d'Histoire Moderne & Contemporaine |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=429–436 |access-date=October 4, 2023 |archive-date=October 23, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221023133547/https://www.persee.fr/doc/rhmc_0996-2743_1900_num_2_4_4185_t1_0429_0000_1 |url-status=live }}</ref> The revolutionary government, both the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and the [[Committee of General Security]], sought to gain the favor of the American ambassador, not wanting to risk the alliance with the [[United States]]; therefore, they were more inclined to focus on Paine.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" />

Paine narrowly escaped execution. A chalk mark was supposed to be left by the jailer on the door of a cell to denote that the prisoner inside was due to be removed for execution. In Paine's case, the mark had accidentally been made on the inside of his door rather than the outside, because the door of Paine's cell had been left open when the jailer was making his rounds that day, since Paine had been receiving official visitors. But for this quirk of fate, Paine would have been executed the following morning. He kept his head and survived the few vital days needed to be spared by the fall of Robespierre on [[Thermidorian Reaction|9 Thermidor]] (July 27, 1794).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life and Writings of Thomas Paine: Containing a Biography|last1=Paine|first1=Thomas|last2=Rickman|first2=Thomas Clio|publisher=Vincent Parke & Co.|year=1908|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lifeandwritings07goog/page/n301 261]–262|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeandwritings07goog|quote=thomas paine jailer door.|access-date=February 21, 2008}}</ref>

Paine was released in November 1794 largely because of the work of the new American ambassador to France, [[James Monroe]],<ref>Foot, Michael, and Kramnick, Isaac. 1987. ''The Thomas Paine Reader'', p. 16</ref> who successfully argued the case for Paine's U.S. citizenship.<ref>Eric Foner, 1976. ''Tom Paine and Revolutionary America'', p. 244.</ref> In July 1795, he was re-admitted into the convention, as were other surviving Girondins. Paine was one of only three ''députés'' to oppose the adoption of the new [[Constitution of the Year III|1795 constitution]], because it eliminated [[universal suffrage]], which had been proclaimed, at least for men, by the [[French Constitution of 1793|Montagnard Constitution of 1793]].<ref>[[François Victor Alphonse Aulard|Aulard, Alphonse]]. 1901. ''Histoire politique de la Révolution française'', p. 555.</ref>

In addition to receiving a British patent for a single-span iron bridge, Paine developed a smokeless candle<ref>See [http://www.ushistory.org/Paine/index.htm Thomas Paine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929122148/http://www.ushistory.org/paine/index.htm|date=September 29, 2006}}, Independence Hall Association; accessed online November 4, 2006.</ref> and worked with inventor [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]] in developing steam engines.

In 1797, Paine lived in Paris with [[Nicholas Bonneville]] and his wife, [[Marguerite Brazier]]. As well as Bonneville's other controversial guests, Paine aroused the suspicions of authorities. Bonneville hid the [[Royalist]] [[Antoine Joseph Barruel-Beauvert]] at his home. Beauvert had been outlawed following the [[coup of 18 Fructidor]] on September 4, 1797. Paine believed that the United States under President [[John Adams]] had betrayed revolutionary France.<ref name="ODNB">{{Cite ODNB

In 1800, still under police surveillance, Bonneville took refuge with his father in [[Evreux]]. Paine stayed on with him, helping Bonneville with the burden of translating the "Covenant Sea". The same year, Paine purportedly had a meeting with [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Napoleon claimed he slept with a copy of ''Rights of Man'' (''Les Droits de l'Homme'' in French) under his pillow and went so far as to say to Paine that "a statue of gold should be erected to you in every city in the universe".<ref name="oneill">{{Cite news|title=Who was Thomas Paine?|last=O'Neill|first=Brendan|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8089115.stm|date=June 8, 2009|access-date=June 10, 2018|archive-date=June 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612144109/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8089115.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://ordinaryphilosophy.com/2015/09/06/seventh-day-in-paris-following-thomas-paine-mary-wollstonecraft-and-thomas-jefferson-aug-21st-2015/ | title=Seventh Day in Paris Following Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Thomas Jefferson | date=September 6, 2015 }}</ref> Paine discussed with Napoleon how best to invade England.

===Criticism of George Washington===
Upset that President Washington, a friend since the Revolutionary War, did nothing during Paine's imprisonment in France, Paine believed Washington had betrayed him and conspired with Robespierre. While staying with Monroe, Paine planned to send Washington a letter of grievance on the president's birthday. Monroe stopped the letter from being sent, and after Paine's criticism of the [[Jay Treaty]], which was supported by Washington, Monroe suggested that Paine live elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine|author=Craig Nelson|page=[https://archive.org/details/thomaspaineenlig0000nels/page/291 291]|isbn=978-0670037889|year=2006|url=https://archive.org/details/thomaspaineenlig0000nels/page/291|publisher=New York: Viking}}</ref>

Paine then sent a stinging letter to Washington, in which he described him as an incompetent commander and a vain and ungrateful person. Having received no response, Paine contacted his longtime publisher [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Bache]], the [[Jeffersonian democrat]], to publish his ''Letter to George Washington'' of 1796 in which he derided Washington's reputation by describing him as a treacherous man who was unworthy of his fame as a military and political hero. Paine wrote that "the world will be puzzled to decide whether you are an apostate or an impostor; whether you have abandoned good principles or whether you ever had any".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Founders Online: To George Washington from Thomas Paine, 30 July 1796 |url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-20-02-0329 |access-date=2024-02-25 |website=founders.archives.gov |language=en}}</ref> He declared that without France's aid Washington could not have succeeded in the American Revolution and had "but little share in the glory of the final event".

==Later years==
[[File:Thomas Paine A16220.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[John Wesley Jarvis]], {{circa}} 1806–1807]]
Paine remained in France until 1802, returning to the United States only at President Jefferson's invitation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-33-02-0302|title=Founders Online: From Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Paine, 18 March 1801|website=founders.archives.gov|language=en|access-date=August 20, 2019|archive-date=August 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820150705/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-33-02-0302|url-status=live}}</ref> Paine also paid for the passage for Bonneville's wife [[Marguerite Brazier]] and the couple's three sons, [[Benjamin Bonneville|Benjamin]], Louis, and Thomas Bonneville, to whom Paine was godfather. Paine returned to the U.S. in the early stages of the [[Second Great Awakening]] and a time of great political partisanship. The ''Age of Reason'' gave ample excuse for the religiously devout to dislike him, while the Federalists attacked him for his ideas of government stated in ''Common Sense,'' for his association with the French Revolution, and for his friendship with President Jefferson. Also, still fresh in the minds of the public was his ''Letter to Washington,'' published six years before his return. This was compounded when his right to vote was denied in [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] on the grounds that Gouverneur Morris did not recognize him as an American and Washington had not aided him.<ref>Claeys, Gregory, 1989. ''Thomas Paine, Social and Political Thought''.{{ISBN?}}{{page needed|date=September 2021}}</ref>

Brazier took care of Paine at the end of his life and buried him after his death. In his will, Paine left the bulk of his estate to her, including 100 acres (40.5 ha) of his farm so she could maintain and educate Benjamin and his brother Thomas.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Paine | first1=T. | last2=Wheeler | first2=D.E. | last3=Rickman | first3=T.C. | title=The Life and Writings of Thomas Paine: Containing a Biography | publisher=Vincent Parke | issue=v. 10 | year=1908 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFE2D3F_aNAC | access-date=2022-04-21 | chapter=The Will of Thomas Paine | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFE2D3F_aNAC&pg=PA365 | page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tFE2D3F_aNAC&pg=PA368 368] | archive-date=December 30, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230044610/https://books.google.com/books?id=tFE2D3F_aNAC | url-status=live }}</ref>

One Penny-Worth of Truth, from Thomas Bull to His Brother John (London: Stockdale, 1791)</ref> dug up his bones and transported them back to England with the intention to give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but this never came to pass. The bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died over fifteen years later but were later lost. There is no confirmed story about what happened to them after that, although various people have claimed throughout the years to own parts of Paine's remains, such as his skull and right hand.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Paine Monument at Last Finds a Home|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1905/10/15/archives/the-paine-monument-at-last-finds-a-home-accepted-by-new-rochelle.html|date=October 15, 1905|access-date=February 23, 2008|archive-date=February 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226192603/https://www.nytimes.com/1905/10/15/archives/the-paine-monument-at-last-finds-a-home-accepted-by-new-rochelle.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Rehabilitating Thomas Paine, Bit by Bony Bit|last=Chen|first=David W.|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://www.mindspring.com/~phila1/nyt330.htm|access-date=February 23, 2008|archive-date=May 16, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516140408/http://www.mindspring.com/~phila1/nyt330.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[[Edwin G.

At the time of his death, most American newspapers reprinted the obituary notice from the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'' that was in turn quoting from ''The American Citizen'',<ref>{{Cite news|title=Paine's Obituary (click the "1809" link; it is 1/3 way down the 4th column)|newspaper=New York Evening Post|url=http://www.classicapologetics.com/special/painerelief.html|date=June 10, 1809|access-date=November 22, 2013|archive-date=October 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019010228/http://www.classicapologetics.com/special/painerelief.html|url-status=live}}</ref> which read in part: "He had lived long, did some good, and much harm". Only six mourners came to his funeral, two of whom were black, most likely [[Freedman|freedmen]]. Months later appeared a hostile biography by James Cheetham, who had admired him since the latter's days as a young radical in Manchester, and who had been friends with Paine for a short time before the two fell out. Many years later the writer and orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] wrote:

{{blockquote|Thomas Paine had passed the legendary limit of life. One by one most of his old friends and acquaintances had deserted him. Maligned on every side, execrated, shunned and abhorred – his virtues denounced as vices – his services forgotten – his character blackened, he preserved the poise and balance of his soul. He was a victim of the people, but his convictions remained unshaken. He was still a soldier in the army of freedom, and still tried to enlighten and civilize those who were impatiently waiting for his death. Even those who loved their enemies hated him, their friend — the friend of the whole world – with all their hearts. On the 8th of June 1809, death came – Death, almost his only friend. At his funeral no pomp, no pageantry, no civic procession, no military display. In a carriage, a woman and her son who had lived on the bounty of the dead – on horseback, a Quaker, the humanity of whose heart dominated the creed of his head – and, following on foot, two negroes filled with gratitude — constituted the funeral cortege of Thomas Paine.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine (1892)|author=Robert G.

==Ideas and views==
{{republicanism sidebar}}
Biographer [[Eric Foner]] identifies a utopian thread in Paine's thought, writing: "Through this new language he communicated a new vision{{snd}}a utopian image of an egalitarian, republican society".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tom Paine and Revolutionary America|author=Eric Foner|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=2nd|pages=xxxii, 16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OyFF1M8_VDAC|isbn=978-0195174861|access-date=July 1, 2015|archive-date=October 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016044059/https://books.google.com/books?id=OyFF1M8_VDAC|url-status=live}}</ref>

Paine's utopianism combined [[republicanism in the United States|civic republicanism]], belief in the inevitability of scientific and social progress and commitment to free markets and liberty generally. The multiple sources of Paine's political theory all pointed to a society based on the common good and individualism. Paine expressed a redemptive futurism or political messianism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jendrysik | first1 = Mark | year = 2007 | title = Tom Paine: Utopian? | journal = Utopian Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 139–157 | doi = 10.5325/utopianstudies.18.2.0139 | s2cid = 149860226 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Writing that his generation "would appear to the future as the Adam of a new world", Paine exemplified British utopianism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature|editor=Gregory Claeys|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=11–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFCuoqykV9QC&pg=PA11|isbn=978-1139828420|access-date=July 1, 2015|archive-date=October 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016044059/https://books.google.com/books?id=sFCuoqykV9QC&pg=PA11|url-status=live}}</ref>

Later, his encounters with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] made a deep impression. The ability of the [[Iroquois]] to live in harmony with nature while achieving a democratic decision-making process helped him refine his thinking on how to organize society.<ref name="Weatherford 2010 p.

===Slavery===

Paine was critical of slavery and declared himself to be an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]].<ref name="hitch2829">Hitchens (2007), pp. 28–29</ref> As secretary to the [[Pennsylvania]] legislature, he helped draft legislation to outlaw Patriot involvement in the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]].<ref>Hitchens (2007), pp. 43–44</ref> Paine's statement, "Man has no property in man", although used by him in ''[[Rights of Man]]'' to deny the right of any generation to bind future ones, has also been interpreted as an argument against slavery.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hitchens |first1=Christopher |title=Arguably |date=2012 |publisher=Hachette |isbn=978-1-4555-0278-3 |page=162}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Kaye |first1=Harvey J. |title=Thomas Paine and the Promise of America: A History & Biography |date=2007 |page=147 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0374707064 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6iz3tX-qKIC&dq=%22Man+has+no+property+in+man%22+slavery+paine&pg=PA147 |access-date=August 14, 2022 |archive-date=December 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230044614/https://books.google.com/books?id=s6iz3tX-qKIC&dq=%22Man+has+no+property+in+man%22+slavery+paine&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q=%22Man%20has%20no%20property%20in%20man%22%20slavery%20paine&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> In the book, Paine also describes his mission, among other things, as to "break the chains of slavery and oppression".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Paine |first1=Thomas |title=Rights of Man, Common Sense, and Other Political Writings |date=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199538003 |page=324 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slgVDAAAQBAJ&q=rights+of+man+%22break+the+&pg=PA324 |access-date=September 9, 2022 |archive-date=December 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230045612/https://books.google.com/books?id=slgVDAAAQBAJ&q=rights+of+man+%22break+the+&pg=PA324#v=snippet&q=rights%20of%20man%20%22break%20the&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

On March 8, 1775, one month after Paine became the editor of ''The Pennsylvania Magazine'', the magazine published an anonymous article titled "African Slavery in America," the first prominent piece in the colonies proposing the [[emancipation]] of African-American slaves and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of slavery.<ref name=Rodriguez>{{Cite book|title=Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia|last=Rodriguez|first=Junius P.|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X44KbDBl9gC&pg=PA279|isbn=978-1851095445|access-date=July 1, 2015|archive-date=September 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904024401/https://books.google.com/books?id=4X44KbDBl9gC&pg=PA279|url-status=live}}</ref> Paine is often credited with writing the piece,<ref name=Rodriguez /> on the basis of later testimony by Benjamin Rush, cosigner of the Declaration of Independence.<ref name="LoA" />

During the American Revolutionary War, the British implemented several policies that allowed [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]] fleeing from American enslavers to find refuge within British lines. Writing in response to these policies, Paine wrote in ''Common Sense'' that Britain "hath stirred up the Indians and the Negroes to destroy us".<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRBkDwAAQBAJ&dq=Thousands,+and+tens+of+thousands,+who+would+think+it+glorious+to+expel+from+the+continent+that+barbarous+hellish+power&pg=PT23 | isbn=978-8027241521 | title=Common Sense & the Rights of Man: Words of a Visionary That Sparked the Revolution and Remained the Core of American Democratic Principles | year=2018 | publisher=E-artnow | access-date=March 19, 2023 | archive-date=April 8, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408025539/https://books.google.com/books?id=lRBkDwAAQBAJ&dq=Thousands,+and+tens+of+thousands,+who+would+think+it+glorious+to+expel+from+the+continent+that+barbarous+hellish+power&pg=PT23 | url-status=live }}</ref> Paine, together with [[Joel Barlow]], unsuccessfully tried to convince President Jefferson not to import the [[Slavery in the United States|institution of slavery]] to the [[Louisiana Territory|territory]] acquired in the [[Louisiana Purchase]], suggesting he rather settle it with free Black families and [[German Americans|German immigrants]].<ref>Hitchens (2007), p. 139.</ref>

===State funded social programs===
In his ''Rights of Man, Part Second'', Paine advocated a comprehensive program of state support for the population to ensure the welfare of society, including state subsidy for poor people, state-financed universal public education, and state-sponsored [[prenatal care]] and [[postnatal care]], including state subsidies to families at childbirth. Recognizing that a person's "labor ought to be over" before old age, Paine also called for a state [[pension]] to all workers starting at age 50, which would be doubled at age 60.<ref>[[Harlow Giles Unger]], "Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence" (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), p. 154</ref>

===''Agrarian Justice''===
His last pamphlet, ''[[Agrarian Justice]]'', published in the winter of 1795, opposed agrarian law and agrarian monopoly and further developed his ideas in the ''Rights of Man'' about how land ownership separated the majority of people from their rightful, natural inheritance and means of independent survival. The U.S. [[Social Security Administration]] recognizes ''Agrarian Justice'' as the first American proposal for an [[Pension|old-age pension]] and [[basic income]] or [[citizen's dividend]]. Per ''Agrarian Justice'':

<blockquote>In advocating the case of the persons thus dispossessed, it is a right, and not a charity ... [Government must] create a national fund, out of which there shall be paid to every person, when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the sum of fifteen pounds sterling, as a compensation in part, for the loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property. And also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every person now living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they shall arrive at that age.</blockquote>

In this pamphlet he argued "All accumulation of personal property, beyond what a man's own hands produce, is derived to him by living in society; and he owes on every principle of justice, of gratitude, and of civilization, a part of that accumulation back again to society from whence the whole came".<ref>{{cite book |title=Thomas Paine: Collected Writings |date=1995 |publisher=Library of America |page=408}}</ref>

Lamb argues that Paine's analysis of property rights marks a distinct contribution to political theory. His theory of property defends a libertarian concern with private ownership that shows an egalitarian commitment. Paine's new justification of property sets him apart from previous theorists such as [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] and [[John Locke]]. Lamb says it demonstrates Paine's commitment to foundational liberal values of individual freedom and moral equality.<ref>Lamb, Robert. "Liberty, Equality, and the Boundaries of Ownership: Thomas Paine's Theory of Property Rights." ''Review of Politics'' (2010), 72#3, pp. 483–511.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> In response to Paine's "Agrarian Justice", [[Thomas Spence]] wrote "''The Rights of Infants''" wherein he argued that Paine's plan was not beneficial to impoverished people because landlords would just keep raising land prices, further enriching themselves rather than giving the commonwealth an equal chance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marangos|first=John|date=2008-04-11|title=Thomas Paine (1737–1809) and Thomas Spence (1750–1814) on land ownership, land taxes and the provision of citizens' dividend|url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/03068290810861576/full/html|journal=International Journal of Social Economics|language=en|volume=35|issue=5|pages=313–325|doi=10.1108/03068290810861576|issn=0306-8293|access-date=March 11, 2021|archive-date=May 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508082911/https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/03068290810861576/full/html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Fiat currency===
Paine was strongly opposed to [[fiat money]], which he viewed as counterfeiting by the state. He said "The punishment of a member [of a legislature] who should move for such a law ought to be death".<ref>Griffin, G. Edward ''The Creature from Jekyll Island'' (1994)</ref> As part of his essay ''Dissertations on Government, etc.'', published in February, 1786, Paine included a scathing condemnation of paper money emphasizing “The pretense for paper money has been, that there was not a sufficiency of gold and silver. This, so far from being a reason for paper emissions, is a reason against them.”<ref name=":9">Smith, George Ford [https://mises.org/mises-wire/thomas-paine-paper-money-and-morality "Thomas Paine on Paper Money and Morality"] Mises.org</ref>

==Religious views==
Before his arrest and imprisonment in France, knowing that he would probably be arrested and executed, following in the tradition of [[Deism#The rise of British deism (1690–1740)|early 18th-century English Deism]] Paine wrote the first part of ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' (1793–1794). Paine's religious views as expressed in ''The Age of Reason'' caused quite a stir in religious society, effectively splitting the religious groups into two major factions: those who wanted [[disestablishment|church disestablishment]], and the Christians who wanted Christianity to continue having a strong social influence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Noll|first=Mark A.|title=Religion in the Early Republic: A Second Tom Paine Effect|date=November 2017|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1479244316000287/type/journal_article|journal=Modern Intellectual History|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=883–898|doi=10.1017/S1479244316000287|s2cid=152274951|issn=1479-2443|access-date=March 11, 2021|archive-date=May 27, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210527174919/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-intellectual-history/article/abs/religion-in-the-early-republic-a-second-tom-paine-effect/9585DC928BFF49BB1911EDA2500D763D|url-status=live}}</ref>

About his own religious beliefs, Paine wrote in ''The Age of Reason'':

{{blockquote|I believe in [[one God]], and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.}}

{{blockquote|I do not believe in the creed professed by the [[Judaism|Jewish church]], by the [[Catholicism|Roman church]], by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek church]], by the [[Islam|Turkish church]], by the [[Protestantism|Protestant church]], nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church. All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.}}

{{blockquote|Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Theological Works of Thomas Paine|author=Thomas Paine|year=1824|publisher=R.

Historian [[Jack P. Greene]] stated:

{{blockquote|In a fundamental sense, we are today all Paine's children.

Harvey J. Kaye wrote that through Paine, through his pamphlets and catchphrases such as "The sun never shined on a cause of greater worth," "We have it in our power to begin the world over again," and "These are the times that try men's souls" did more than move Americans to declare their independence:

John Stevenson argues that in the early 1790s, numerous radical political societies were formed throughout England and Wales in which Paine's writings provided "a boost to the self-confidence of those seeking to participate in politics for the first time."<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stevenson | first1 = John | year = 1989 | title = 'Paineites to a Man'?

The quote "Lead, follow, or get out of the way" is widely but incorrectly attributed to Paine. It can be found nowhere in his published works.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gray |first1=Rosie |title=Mitt Romney Misquoted Thomas Paine In Victory Speech |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosiegray/mitt-romney-misquoted-thomas-paine-in-victory-spee |website=[[BuzzFeed News]] |access-date=April 26, 2019 |language=en |date=February 1, 2012 |archive-date=April 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426020538/https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosiegray/mitt-romney-misquoted-thomas-paine-in-victory-spee |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Abraham Lincoln===
In 1835, when he was 26 years old, [[Abraham Lincoln]] wrote a defense of Paine's deism.<ref>Robert Havlik, "Some Influences of Thomas Paine's Age of Reason Upon
Abraham Lincoln," ''Lincoln Herald,'' 104 (Summer 2002): 61–70.</ref> A political associate, Samuel Hill, burned the manuscript to save Lincoln's political career.<ref>Michael Burlingame, ''Abraham Lincoln: a Life'' (2008), vol. 2, p. 83.</ref> Historian [[Roy Basler]], the editor of Lincoln's papers, said Paine had a strong influence on Lincoln's style:

<blockquote>No other writer of the eighteenth century, with the exception of Jefferson, parallels more closely the temper or gist of Lincoln's later thought. In style, Paine above all others affords the variety of eloquence which, chastened and adapted to Lincoln's own mood, is revealed in Lincoln's formal writings.<ref>Roy P. Basler (ed.), ''Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writings'' (1946), p. 6.</ref></blockquote>

===Thomas Edison===
The inventor [[Thomas Edison]] said:

<blockquote>I have always regarded Paine as one of the greatest of all Americans. Never have we had a sounder intelligence in this republic.... It was my good fortune to encounter Thomas Paine's works in my boyhood... it was, indeed, a revelation to me to read that great thinker's views on political and theological subjects. Paine educated me, then, about many matters of which I had never before thought. I remember, very vividly, the flash of enlightenment that shone from Paine's writings, and I recall thinking, at that time, 'What a pity these works are not today the schoolbooks for all children!' My interest in Paine was not satisfied by my first reading of his works. I went back to them time and again, just as I have done since my boyhood days.<ref>Thomas Edison, Introduction to ''The Life and Works of Thomas Paine'', New York: Citadel Press, 1945, Vol. I, pp. vii–ix. [http://www.thomaspaine.org/ Reproduced online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041110005749/http://www.thomaspaine.org/ |date=November 10, 2004 }} on thomaspaine.org, accessed November 4, 2006.</ref></blockquote>

===South America===
In 1811, Venezuelan translator Manuel Garcia de Sena published a book in Philadelphia that consisted mostly of Spanish translations of several of Paine's most important works.<ref name="street">John Street, ''Artigas and the Emancipation of Uruguay'' (London: Cambridge University Press, 1959), 178–186.</ref> The book also included translations of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the U.S. Constitution and the constitutions of five U.S. states.<ref name="street"/>

It subsequently circulated widely in South America and through it [[Uruguayan]] national hero [[José Gervasio Artigas]] became familiar with and embraced Paine's ideas. In turn, many of Artigas's writings drew directly from Paine's, including the ''[[Instructions of 1813]]'', which Uruguayans consider to be one of their country's most important constitutional documents, and was one of the earliest writings to articulate a principled basis for an identity independent of Buenos Aires.<ref name="street"/>

===Memorials===
{{Main|Memorials to Thomas Paine}}
[[File:Thomas Paine Monument 2015.png|thumb|upright|The [[Thomas Paine Monument]]]]
The first and longest-standing memorial to Paine is the carved and inscribed 12-foot marble column in [[New Rochelle, New York]], organized and funded by publisher, educator and reformer Gilbert Vale (1791–1866) and raised in 1839 by the American sculptor and architect [[John Frazee (sculptor, born 1790)|John Frazee]], the [[Thomas Paine Monument]] (see image below).<ref>See Frederick S. Voss, ''John Frazee 1790–1852 Sculptor'' (Washington City and Boston: The National Portrait Gallery and The Boston Athenaeum, 1986), pp. 46–47.{{ISBN?}}</ref>

New Rochelle is also the original site of [[Thomas Paine Cottage|Thomas Paine's Cottage]], which along with a 320-acre (130 ha) farm were presented to Paine in 1784 by act of the New York State Legislature for his services in the American Revolution.<ref>See Alfred Owen Aldridge, ''Man of Reason'' (Philadelphia: J.

[[File:Statue of Thomas Paine, parc Montsouris, Paris (4).jpg | thumb|upright | Statue of Thomas Paine in Parc Montsouris, Paris, dedicated in 1948]]
In the 20th century, [[Joseph L. Lewis|Joseph Lewis]], longtime president of the Freethinkers of America and an ardent Paine admirer, was instrumental in having larger-than-life-sized statues of Paine erected in each of the three countries with which the revolutionary writer was associated. The first, created by [[Mount Rushmore]] sculptor [[Gutzon Borglum]], was erected in the [[Parc Montsouris]], [[Paris]], just before [[World War II]] began but not formally dedicated until 1948. It depicts Paine standing before the French [[National Convention]] to plead for the life of [[King Louis XVI]]. The second, sculpted in 1950 by [[Georg J. Lober]], was erected near Paine's one-time home in [[Morristown, New Jersey]]. It shows a seated Paine using a drumhead as a makeshift table. The third, sculpted by Sir [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]], President of the Royal Academy, was erected in 1964 in Paine's birthplace, [[Thetford]], England. With a quill pen in his right hand and an inverted copy of ''The Rights of Man'' in his left, it occupies a prominent location on King Street. Thomas Paine was ranked No. 34 in the ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]'' 2002 extensive Nationwide poll conducted by the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite news

}} A complete edition of Paine's writings, on the model of Eric Foner's edition for the Library of America, is badly needed. Until then Philip Foner's two-volume edition is a serviceable substitute. Volume I contains the major works, and volume II contains shorter writings, both published essays and a selection of letters, but confusingly organized; in addition, Foner's attributions of writings to Paine have come in for some criticism in that Foner may have included writings that Paine edited but did not write and omitted some writings that later scholars have attributed to Paine.
