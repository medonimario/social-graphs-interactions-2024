'''Abraham Tucker''' (2 September 1705 – 20 November 1774) was an [[England|English]] country gentleman, who devoted himself to the study of [[philosophy]]. He wrote ''The Light of Nature Pursued'' (1768–1777) under the name of '''Edward Search'''.

==Biography==
Tucker was born in [[London]] of a [[Somerset]] family, the son of a wealthy city merchant. His parents died during his infancy, and he was brought up by his uncle, Sir Isaac Tillard. In 1721, he entered [[Merton College]], [[Oxford]], as a [[gentleman commoner]], and studied philosophy, mathematics, [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[music]]. He afterwards studied laws at the [[Inner Temple]], but was never called to the bar.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Tucker, Abraham|volume=27|page=361}} This work in turn cites:

In 1727 he bought [[Betchworth Castle]], near [[Dorking]], where he passed the remainder of his life.<ref name="EB1911"/> In 1736 Tucker married Dorothy Barker, daughter of Edward Barker of [[East Betchworth]], [[cursitor baron of the exchequer]]. They had two daughters, Judith (died 1794), and Dorothea Maria, who married in 1763 [[Sir Henry St John, 2nd Baronet]] of [[Dogmersfield Park]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=27786|first=B. W.|last=Young|title=Tucker, Abraham}}</ref> On his wife's death in 1754, Tucker occupied himself in collecting together all the letters that had passed between them, which, we are told, he transcribed twice over under the title of "The Picture of Artless Love."

He then concentrated on his major work, ''The Light of Nature Pursued'', of which in 1763 he published a specimen under the title of ''Free Will, Foreknowledge, and Fate'', by "Edward Search". The strictures of a critic in the ''Monthly Review'' of July 1763 drew from him a pamphlet called ''Man in Quest of Himself'', by "Cuthbert Comment" (reprinted in [[Samuel Parr]]'s ''Metaphysical Tracts'', 1837), "a defence of the individuality of the human mind or self." In 1768 the first two volumes of his work were published. The remaining volume appeared posthumously. His eyesight failed him completely in 1771, but he contrived an apparatus which enabled him to write legibly enough that the result could be transcribed by his daughter. The final volume was ready for publication when he died.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Tucker took no part in politics, and wrote a pamphlet, ''The Country Gentleman's Advice to his Son on the Subject of Party Clubs'' (1755), cautioning young men against its snares.<ref name="EB1911"/>

==Work==
Tucker's magnum opus is ''The Light of Nature Pursued'', originally published in three volumes:

* Volume 1: Human Nature (1768)
* Volume 2: Theology (1768)
* Volume 3: Lights of Nature and Gospel Blended (1777)

The author's intention is to draw up "a scheme of nature and the fundamentals of [[natural religion]], founded upon the basis of experience and observations resulting therefrom".<ref>Tucker, Abraham. ''The Light of Nature Pursued''. Volume 3, Chapter 1, Section 2.</ref> His work contains many psychological and more strictly metaphysical discussions, but it is chiefly in connexion with [[ethics]] that Tucker's speculations are best remembered. In important points he anticipated the [[utilitarianism]] of [[William Paley]], who expressed obligations to his predecessor. "Every man's own satisfaction" Tucker held to be the ultimate end of action; and satisfaction or pleasure is one and the same in kind, however much it may vary in degree. This universal motive is further connected, as by Paley, through the will of God, with the "general good, the root where out all our rules of conduct and sentiments of honour are to branch."<ref name="EB1911"/>

''The Light of Nature Pursued'' was republished with a biographical sketch by Tucker's grandson [[Sir Henry St John-Mildmay, 3rd Baronet]] (1805, other editions 1831, 1834, &c.), and an abridged edition by [[William Hazlitt]] appeared in 1807.<ref name="EB1911"/>
