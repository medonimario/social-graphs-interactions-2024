== Early life and education ==
[[File:TIMEMagazine24Nov1924.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cover, 24 November 1924]]
He was born on 6 June 1860 in [[Crayke]], [[Yorkshire]], England. His father, [[William Inge (priest, born 1829)|Rev. William Inge]] was the local [[curate]], and would later go on to become Provost of [[Worcester College, Oxford]]. His mother was Susanna Inge ({{nee}} Churton), daughter of [[Edward Churton]], rector of Crayke and the [[Archdeacon of Cleveland]]. Inge had a "staunchly [[high-church]] upbringing".{{sfn|Grimley|2004}}

Inge was educated at [[Eton College]], where he was a King's Scholar and won the [[Newcastle Scholarship]] in 1879. In 1879, he went on to [[King's College, Cambridge]], where he won a number of prizes including the [[Chancellor's Gold Medal|Chancellor's Medal]], as well as taking firsts in both parts of the [[Classical Tripos]].<ref name=venn/>

== Career ==

===Positions held===
Inge was an assistant master at Eton from 1884 to 1888, and a Fellow of King's College from 1886 to 1888.<ref name=venn/>

In the [[Church of England]], he was ordained deacon in 1888, and priest in 1892.<ref name=venn/>

He was a Fellow and Tutor at [[Hertford College, Oxford]] from 1889 to 1904.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Hertford College Magazine|date=May 1954|issue=42|title=Obituary|pages=420–422|url=https://www.hertford.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1954-No.-42-The-Hertford-College-Magazine.pdf|access-date=23 September 2023}}</ref>

His only parochial position was as [[vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] of [[All Saints, Knightsbridge]], London, from 1905 to 1907.<ref name=venn>{{acad|id=IN879WR|name=Inge, William Ralph}}</ref>

In 1907, he moved to [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], on being appointed [[Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity]].

In 1911, he became [[Dean of St Paul's]] Cathedral in [[London]]. He served as president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] at Cambridge from 1920 to 1921.

He retired from full-time church ministry in 1934.

Inge was also a trustee of London's [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] from 1921 until 1951.

===Writing===
Inge was a prolific author. In addition to scores of articles, lectures and sermons, he also wrote over 35 books.{{sfn|Austen|n.d.}} Inge was a columnist for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' for many years, finishing in 1946.

He is best known for his works on [[Plotinus]]{{sfn|Austen|n.d.}} and [[neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] philosophy, and on [[Christian mysticism]], but also wrote on general topics of life and current politics.

He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] three times.<ref name="Nomination Database"/>

=== Views ===

Inge was a strong proponent of the spiritual type of religion—"that autonomous faith which rests upon experience and individual inspiration"—as opposed to one of coercive authority. He was therefore outspoken in his criticisms of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. His thought, on the whole, represents a blending of traditional Christian theology with elements of Platonic philosophy. He shares this in common with one of his favourite writers, [[Benjamin Whichcote]], the first of the [[Cambridge Platonists]].

He was nicknamed 'The Gloomy Dean' because of his [[pessimism|pessimistic]] views in his [[Romanes Lecture]] of 1920, "The Idea of Progress"{{sfn|Inge|1920}} and in his ''Evening Standard'' articles. In his Romanes Lecture he said that although mankind's accumulated experience and wonderful discoveries had great value, they did not constitute real progress in human nature itself.

He disapproved of [[democracy]], which he called "an absurdity" and compared it to "the famous occasion when the voice of the people cried, Crucify Him!"<ref>{{cite news | title = A Cause Lost—and Forgotten | work = University Bookman | date = March 2015 | access-date = 6 April 2017 | url=https://herandrews.com/2015/03/01/women-against-suffrage/ }}</ref> He wrote "Human beings are born unequal, and the only persons who have a right to govern their neighbours are those who are competent to do so."{{sfn|Inge|1932|p=122}} He advanced various arguments why women [[Anti-suffragism|should have fewer voting rights]] than men, if any.{{sfn|Inge|1932|pp=121-127}}{{Primary source inline|date=April 2023}}

He was also a [[eugenicist]]{{sfn|Austen|n.d.}} and wrote considerably on the subject. In his book ''Outspoken Essays'', he devotes an entire chapter to this subject. His views included that the state should decide which couples be allowed to have children.{{sfn|Austen|n.d.}}

Inge opposed [[Welfare|social welfare]] "on the grounds that it penalized the successful while subsidizing the weak and feckless".{{sfn|Austen|n.d.}}

He was also known for his support for [[nudism]].{{sfn|Shaw|1937|p=24}} He supported the publishing of [[Maurice Parmelee]]'s<ref name="Parmelee1927">{{cite book|last=Parmelee|first=Maurice |title=The new gymnosophy: the philosophy of nudity as applied in modern life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9yBAAAAMAAJ|year=1927|publisher=F. H. Hitchcock}}</ref> book, ''The New Gymnosophy: Nudity and the Modern Life'',{{sfn|Hirning|2013|p=276}} and was critical of town councillors who were insisting that bathers wear full bathing costumes.<ref name="brit_Dean">{{Cite news | title = Dean Inge and The Nudists | work = Gloucestershire Echo|page=1 col E| date = 17 November 1932 | access-date = 2 May 2016 | url = http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000320/19321117/016/0001 | via= [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

=== Recognition ===
He was made a [[Royal Victorian Order|Commander of the Victorian Order (CVO)]] in 1918 and promoted to [[Knight Commander]] (KCVO) in 1930.<ref name=venn/> He received Honorary Doctorates of Divinity from both Oxford and Aberdeen Universities, Honorary Doctorates of Literature from both Durham and Sheffield, and Honorary Doctorates of Laws from both Edinburgh and St Andrews. He was also an honorary fellow of both King's and Jesus Colleges at Cambridge, and of Hertford College at Oxford. In 1921, he was elected as a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.<ref>{{cite web |title=Very Revd William Ralph Inge FBA |url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/fellows/william-ralph-inge-FBA/ |website=thebritishacademy.ac.uk |publisher=The British Academy |access-date=13 November 2024}}</ref>

[[File:Brightwell Manor House - geograph.org.uk - 921263.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Brightwell Manor]] in 2008]]

On 3 May 1905, Inge married Mary Catharine "Kitty" Spooner, daughter of [[Henry Spooner (priest)|Henry Maxwell Spooner]], the Archdeacon of Maidstone.<ref>{{NPG name | id= 64560 | name= Mary Catharine Inge (née Spooner) }}</ref> They had five children:

The onset of her diabetes was late in 1921. Because the British were operating about a year behind the North Americans, Paula Inge died before good insulin was available. her father consoled himself with the thought that God had given the parents a whole year's grace before taking their daughter.}}</ref>
* Richard Wycliffe Spooner Inge (1915–1941), priest, killed on an RAF training flight<ref>{{CWGC|id=2436265|name=Inge, Richard Wycliffe Spooner|access-date=21 September 2023}}</ref>
