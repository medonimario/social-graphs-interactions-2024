Though he was an accomplished orator and successful lawyer, Cicero believed his political career was his most important achievement. It was during his consulship that the [[Catiline conspiracy]] attempted to overthrow the government through an attack on the city by outside forces, and Cicero (by his own account) suppressed the revolt by summarily and controversially executing five conspirators without trial, an act which would later lead to his exile. During the chaotic middle period of the first century BC, marked by [[List of Roman civil wars and revolts|civil wars]] and the dictatorship of [[Julius Caesar]], Cicero was a supporter of the [[Optimates and populares|Optimates]] faction. Following Caesar's death, Cicero became an enemy of [[Mark Antony]] in the ensuing power struggle, attacking him in a [[Philippicae|series of speeches]]. He was [[proscribed]] as an enemy of the state by the [[Second Triumvirate]] and consequently executed by soldiers operating on their behalf in 43&nbsp;BC, having been intercepted during an attempted flight from the Italian peninsula. His severed hands and head (taken by order of Antony and displayed representing the repercussions of his anti-Antonian actions as a writer and as an orator, respectively) were then displayed on the [[Rostra]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Severed Heads and Hands |url=https://sights.seindal.dk/lexicon/roman-culture/severed-heads-and-hands/ |access-date=9 December 2022 |website=Photo Archive |date=6 August 2003 |language=en-GB |archive-date=9 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221209222952/https://sights.seindal.dk/lexicon/roman-culture/severed-heads-and-hands/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Marcus Tullius Cicero was born on 3 January 106&nbsp;BC in [[Arpinum]], a hill town {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} southeast of Rome.<ref>{{cite book |contributor-last=Shackleton Bailey |contributor-first=D.

However, being a semi-invalid, he could not enter public life and studied extensively to compensate. Little is known about Cicero's mother Helvia, but Cicero's brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus]] wrote in a letter that she was a thrifty housewife.<ref>Rawson, E.: ''Cicero, a portrait'' (1975) pp. 5–6; Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Fam.+16.26.2 16.26.2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511161442/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Fam.+16.26.2 |date=11 May 2008 }} (Quintus to Cicero)</ref>

Cicero's [[cognomen]], a hereditary nickname, comes from the Latin for [[chickpea]], {{lang|la|cicer}}. [[Plutarch]] explains that the name was originally given to one of Cicero's ancestors who had a cleft in the tip of his nose resembling a chickpea.{{sfn|Tempest|2011|p=19, citing {{harvnb|Plut. ''Cic.''|loc=1.3–5}} }} The famous family names of [[Fabia gens|Fabius]], [[Lentulus (disambiguation)|Lentulus]], and [[Calpurnia gens#Calpurnii Pisones|Piso]] come from the Latin names of beans, lentils, and peas, respectively. Plutarch writes that Cicero was urged to change this deprecatory name when he entered politics, but refused, saying that he would make ''Cicero'' more glorious than ''[[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Scaurus]]'' ("Swollen-ankled") and ''[[Catulus]]'' ("Puppy").{{sfn|Plut. ''Cic.''|loc=1.3–5}}

At the age of 15, in 90&nbsp;BC, Cicero started serving under [[Pompey Strabo]] and later [[Sulla]] in the [[Social War (91–87 BC)|Social war]] between Rome and its Italian allies.{{sfn|Tempest|2011|p=27}} When in Rome during the turbulent [[plebeian tribunate]] of [[Publius Sulpicius Rufus]] in 88&nbsp;BC which saw a short bout of fighting between the Sulpicius and Sulla, who had been elected consul for that year, Cicero found himself greatly impressed by Sulpicius' oratory even if he disagreed with his politics.{{sfn|Tempest|2011|pp=27–28}} He continued his studies at Rome, writing a pamphlet titled ''On Invention'' relating to rhetorical argumentation and studying philosophy with Greek academics who had fled the ongoing [[First Mithridatic War]].{{sfn|Tempest|2011|pp=xi, 28}}

=== Education ===
During this period in Roman history, Greek language and cultural studies were highly valued by the elite classes. Cicero was therefore educated in the teachings of the [[ancient Greek philosophers]], [[Ancient Greek literature|poets]] and [[Hellenic historiography|historians]]; as he obtained much of his understanding of the theory and practice of [[rhetoric]] from the Greek poet [[Aulus Licinius Archias|Archias]].{{sfn|Everitt|2001|p=34}} Cicero used his knowledge of Greek to translate many of the theoretical concepts of Greek philosophy into Latin, thus translating Greek philosophical works for a larger audience. It was precisely his broad education that tied him to the traditional Roman elite.{{sfn|Everitt|2001|p=35}}

Cicero's interest in philosophy figured heavily in his later career and led to him providing a comprehensive account of Greek philosophy for a Roman audience,<ref>De Officiis, book 1, n. 1</ref> including creating a philosophical vocabulary in Latin.{{sfn|Everitt|2001|pp=253–55}} In 87 BC, [[Philo of Larissa]], the head of the [[Platonic Academy]] that had been founded by [[Plato]] in Athens about 300 years earlier, arrived in Rome. Cicero, "inspired by an extraordinary zeal for philosophy",<ref>Rawson: "Cicero, a portrait" (1975) p. 18</ref> sat enthusiastically at his feet and absorbed [[Carneades]]' [[Academic skepticism|Academic Skeptic]] philosophy.<ref>J.P.F. Wynne, "Cicero's Skepticism" in ''Skepticism: From Antiquity to the Present'' Bloomsbury Academic 2018 p. 93</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Krebs |first=Christopher B |date=2009 |title=A Seemingly Artless Conversation: Cicero's ''De Legibus'' (1.1–5) |url=https://www.academia.edu/2434123 |journal=Classical Philology |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=90–106 |doi=10.1086/603575 |s2cid=163218114 |issn=0009-837X |access-date=20 October 2022 |archive-date=20 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231220142217/https://www.academia.edu/2434123 |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to Plutarch, Cicero was an extremely talented student, whose learning attracted attention from all over Rome,{{sfn|Plut. ''Cic.''|loc=2.2}} affording him the opportunity to study Roman law under [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur|Quintus Mucius Scaevola]].{{sfn|Plut. ''Cic.''|loc=3.2}} Cicero's fellow students were Gaius Marius Minor, [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]] (who became a famous lawyer, one of the few whom Cicero considered superior to himself in legal matters), and [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Titus Pomponius]]. The latter two became Cicero's friends for life, and Pomponius (who later received the nickname "Atticus", and whose sister married Cicero's brother) would become, in Cicero's own words, "as a second brother", with both maintaining a lifelong correspondence.{{sfn|Everitt|2001|p=35}}

In 79 BC, Cicero left for Greece, [[Asia Minor]] and [[Rhodes]]. This was perhaps to avoid the potential wrath of [[Sulla]], as Plutarch claims,<ref>Haskell, H.J.: "This was Cicero" (1940) p. 83</ref>{{sfn|Plut. ''Cic.''|loc=3.2}} though Cicero himself says it was to hone his skills and improve his physical fitness.{{sfn|Cic. ''Brut.''|loc=313–314}} In [[Athens]] he studied philosophy with [[Antiochus of Ascalon]], the 'Old Academic' and initiator of [[Middle Platonism]].{{sfn|Cic. ''Brut.''|loc=315}} In Asia Minor, he met the leading orators of the region and continued to study with them. Cicero then journeyed to Rhodes to meet his former teacher, Apollonius Molon, who had taught him in Rome. Molon helped Cicero hone the excesses in his style, as well as train his body and lungs for the demands of public speaking.{{sfn|Cic. ''Brut.''|loc=316}} Charting a middle path between the competing [[Atticism|Attic]] and [[Asiatic style]]s, Cicero would ultimately become considered second only to [[Demosthenes]] among history's orators.<ref>Gesine Manuwald, Cicero: Philippics 3–9, vol. 2, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2007, pp. 129ff</ref>

== Early career ==
{{Main|Political career of Cicero}}

===Early legal activity===

While Cicero had feared that the law courts would be closed forever, they were reopened in the aftermath of [[Sulla's civil war]] and the purging of Sulla's political opponents in the [[Sulla's proscription|proscriptions]]. Many of the orators whom Cicero had admired in his youth were now dead from age or political violence. His first major appearance in the courts was in 81&nbsp;BC at the age of 26 when he delivered ''[[Pro Quinctio]]'', a speech defending certain commercial transactions which Cicero had recorded and disseminated.<ref>{{harvnb|Tempest|2011|p=32}}. See also {{cite book |last=Cicero |title=Pro Quinctio |year=1930 |translator-last=Freese |translator-first=J J |url=http://attalus.org/cicero/quinctius.html |access-date=10 April 2023 |archive-date=10 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230410150714/http://attalus.org/cicero/quinctius.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

His more famous speech defending [[Sextus Roscius]] of [[Amelia, Umbria|Ameria]] – {{lang|la|[[Pro Roscio Amerino]]}} – on charges of [[parricide]] in 80&nbsp;BC was his first appearance in criminal court. In this high-profile case, Cicero accused a freedman of the dictator Sulla, [[Lucius Cornelius Chrysogonus|Chrysogonus]], of fabricating Roscius' father's proscription to obtain Roscius' family's property. Successful in his defence, Cicero tactfully avoided incriminating Sulla of any wrongdoing and developed a positive oratorical reputation for himself.{{sfn|Tempest|2011|p=37}}

While Plutarch claims that Cicero left Rome shortly thereafter out of fear of Sulla's response,{{sfn|Plut. ''Cic.''|loc=3.2}} according to Kathryn Tempest, "most scholars now dismiss this suggestion" because Cicero left Rome after Sulla resigned his dictatorship.{{sfn|Tempest|2011|p=37}} Cicero, for his part, later claimed that he left Rome, headed for Asia, to develop his physique and develop his oratory.{{sfn|Cic. ''Brut.''|loc=315–316}} After marrying his wife, [[Terentia]], in 80&nbsp;BC, he eventually left for Asia Minor with his brother [[Quintus Cicero|Quintus]], his friend [[Titus Atticus]], and others on a long trip spanning most of 79 through 77&nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Tempest|2011|pp=37–38}} Returning to Rome in 77&nbsp;BC, Cicero again busied himself with legal defence.<ref>{{harvnb|Tempest|2011|p=39}}. {{harvnb|Plut. ''Cic.''|loc=5.1–2}} claims that Cicero was unpopular and received a warning against oratory from the oracle at Delphi; this is unlikely and contradicted by Cicero's own claims.</ref>

===Early political career===
In 76&nbsp;BC, at the quaestorian elections, Cicero was elected at the minimum age required – 30 years – in the first returns from the ''[[comitia tributa]]'', to the post of [[quaestor]]. Ex officio, he also became a member of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. In the quaestorian lot, he was assigned to [[Sicily]] for 75&nbsp;BC. The post, which was largely one related to financial administration in support of the state or provincial governors, proved for Cicero an important place where he could gain clients in the provinces. His time in Sicily saw him balance his duties – largely in terms of sending more grain back to Rome – with his support for the provincials, Roman businessmen in the area, and local potentates. Adeptly balancing those responsibilities, he won their gratitude.{{sfn|Tempest|2011|pp=41–42}} He was also appreciated by local Syracusans for the rediscovery of the lost tomb of [[Archimedes]], which he personally financed.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Italian Academy |url=https://www.theitalianacademy.com/portfolio-posts/curious-case-tomb-archimedes/#:~:text=Cicero%20found%20it%20and%20accused%20the%20Syracusans%20of%20negligence. |website=The Curious Case of the Tomb of Archimedes |access-date=2 February 2024 |archive-date=2 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240202084909/https://www.theitalianacademy.com/portfolio-posts/curious-case-tomb-archimedes/#:~:text=Cicero%20found%20it%20and%20accused%20the%20Syracusans%20of%20negligence. |url-status=live }}</ref>

Promising to lend the Sicilians his oratorical voice, he was called on a few years after his quaestorship to prosecute the Roman province's governor [[Gaius Verres]],<ref>Verres was governor of Sicily for three years, 73–71&nbsp;BC. 
{{harvnb|Broughton|1952|pp=112, 119, 124}}. Prior to Verres, Sextus Peducaeus and Gaius Licinius Sacerdos had served as Sicilian ''propraetores'' (75 and 74&nbsp;BC, respectively). {{harvnb|Broughton|1952|pp=98, 104}}.</ref> for abuse of power and corruption.{{sfn|Tempest|2011|pp=42–45}} In 70&nbsp;BC, at the age of 36, Cicero launched his first high-profile prosecution against Verres, an emblem of the corrupt Sullan supporters who had risen in the chaos of the civil war.{{sfn|Tempest|2011|p=46}}

The prosecution of Gaius Verres was a great forensic success<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> for Cicero. While Verres hired the prominent lawyer, [[Quintus Hortensius]], after a lengthy period in Sicily collecting testimonials and evidence and persuading witnesses to come forward, Cicero returned to Rome and won the case in a series of dramatic court battles. His unique style of oratory set him apart from the flamboyant Hortensius. On the conclusion of this case, Cicero came to be considered the greatest orator in Rome. The view that Cicero may have taken the case for reasons of his own is viable. Hortensius was, at this point, known as the best lawyer in Rome; to beat him would guarantee much success and the prestige that Cicero needed to start his career. Cicero's oratorical ability is shown in his [[character assassination]] of Verres and various other techniques of persuasion used on the jury. One such example is found in the speech ''[[In Verrem]]'', where he states "with you on this bench, gentlemen, with [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 67 BC)|Marcus Acilius Glabrio]] as your president, I do not understand what Verres can hope to achieve".<ref>Trans.

London: Penguin Books. 1960.</ref> Oratory was considered a great art in ancient Rome and an important tool for disseminating knowledge and promoting oneself in elections, in part because there were no regular newspapers or mass media. Cicero was neither a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] nor a plebeian [[nobiles|noble]]; his rise to political office despite his relatively humble origins has traditionally been attributed to his brilliance as an orator.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bartleby.com/268/2/11.html |title=III.

Cicero grew up in a time of civil unrest and war. Sulla's victory in the first of a series of civil wars led to a new constitutional framework that undermined {{lang|la|[[libertas]]}} (liberty), the fundamental value of the Roman Republic. Nonetheless, Sulla's reforms strengthened the position of the equestrian class, contributing to that class's growing political power. Cicero was both an Italian {{lang|la|eques}} and a {{lang|la|[[novus homo]]}}, but more importantly he was a [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman constitutionalist]]. His social class and loyalty to the Republic ensured that he would "command the support and confidence of the people as well as the Italian middle classes". The [[optimates]] faction never truly accepted Cicero, and this undermined his efforts to reform the Republic while preserving the constitution. Nevertheless, he successfully ascended the cursus honorum, holding each magistracy at or near the youngest possible age: quaestor in 75 BC (age 30), [[aedile]] in 69 BC (age 36), and [[praetor]] in 66 BC (age 39), when he served as president of the "Reclamation" (or extortion) Court. He was then elected consul at age 42.<!-- WP:CALC -->

He began his consular year by opposing a land bill proposed by a plebeian tribune which would have appointed commissioners with semi-permanent authority over land reform.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=43}}<ref name="JLP106" /> Cicero was also active in the courts, defending [[Gaius Rabirius (senator)|Gaius Rabirius]] from accusations of participating in the unlawful killing of plebeian tribune [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]] in 100 BC.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=44}} The prosecution occurred before the {{lang|la|comita centuriata}} and threatened to reopen conflict between the Marian and Sullan factions at Rome.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=44}} Cicero defended the use of force as being authorised by a {{lang|la|senatus consultum ultimum}}, which would prove similar to his own use of force under such conditions.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=44}}

=== Catilinarian Conspiracy ===
{{Rhetoric}}
{{Main|Catilinarian conspiracy}}

Most famously{{snd}}in part because of his own publicity{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=42}}{{snd}}he thwarted a conspiracy led by [[Lucius Sergius Catilina]] to overthrow the [[Roman Republic]] with the help of foreign armed forces. Cicero procured a ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' (a recommendation from the senate attempting to legitimise the use of force){{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=42}} and drove Catiline from the city with four vehement speeches (the [[Catilinarian orations]]), which remain outstanding examples of his rhetorical style.{{Sfn|Krebs|2020}}  The Orations listed Catiline and his followers' debaucheries, and denounced Catiline's senatorial sympathizers as roguish and dissolute debtors clinging to Catiline as a final and desperate hope. Cicero demanded that Catiline and his followers leave the city. At the conclusion of Cicero's first speech (which was made in the [[Temple of Jupiter Stator (3rd century BC)|Temple of Jupiter Stator]]), Catiline hurriedly left the Senate. In his following speeches, Cicero did not directly address Catiline. He delivered <!--maybe; some scholars think not all the Catilinarians were actually delivered, but were rather published-->the second and third orations before the people, and the last one again before the Senate. By these speeches, Cicero wanted to prepare the Senate for the worst possible case; he also delivered more evidence, against Catiline.<ref>Cicero, Marcus Tullius, ''Selected Works'', Penguin Books Ltd, Great Britain, 1971.</ref>

Catiline fled and left behind his followers to start the revolution from within while he himself assaulted the city with an army of "moral and financial bankrupts, or of honest fanatics and adventurers".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Abbott |first1=Frank Frost |title=A History and Description of Roman Political Institutions |date=1901 |publisher=Ginn |location=United States |page=110}}</ref> It is alleged that Catiline had attempted to involve the [[Allobroges]], a tribe of [[Transalpine Gaul]], in their plot, but Cicero, working with the Gauls, was able to seize letters that incriminated the five conspirators and forced them to confess in front of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cic. ''Cat.''|loc=3.2.4–4.9}}; {{harvnb|Sall. ''Cat.''|loc=40–45}}; {{harvnb|Plut. ''Cic.''|loc=18.4}}.</ref> The senate then deliberated upon the conspirators' punishment. As it was the dominant advisory body to the various [[legislative]] assemblies rather than a [[judicial]] body, there were limits to its power; however, martial law was in effect, and it was feared that simple house arrest or exile&nbsp;– the standard options&nbsp;– would not remove the threat to the state. At first [[Decimus Junius Silanus (consul)|Decimus Junius Silanus]] spoke for the "extreme penalty"; but during the debate many were swayed by Julius Caesar, who decried the precedent it would set and argued in favor of life imprisonment in various Italian towns. [[Cato the Younger]] then rose in defense of the death penalty and the Senate finally agreed on the matter, and came down in support of the death penalty. Cicero had the conspirators taken to the [[Tullianum]], the notorious Roman prison, where they were strangled. Cicero himself accompanied the former consul [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura]], one of the conspirators, to the Tullianum.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Susan O. |title=O Tempora! O Mores!

Cicero received the honorific "''[[pater patriae]]''" for his efforts to suppress the conspiracy,{{sfn|Everitt|2001|p=112}} but lived thereafter in fear of trial or exile for having put Roman citizens to death without trial.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stockton |first=David |title=Cicero: A Political Biography |year=1971 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= |pages=174–175}}</ref> While the ''senatus consultum ultimum'' gave some legitimacy to the use of force against the conspirators,{{Efn|Wiedemann describes the senatus consultum ultimum by the late republic as "little more than a fig-leaf by those who could muster a majority in the senate ... to legitimate the use of force".{{sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=44}} }} Cicero also argued that Catiline's conspiracy, by virtue of its treason, made the conspirators enemies of the state and forfeited the protections intrinsically possessed by Roman citizens.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=44}} The consuls moved decisively. Antonius Hybrida was dispatched to defeat Catiline in battle that year, preventing [[Crassus]] or Pompey from exploiting the situation for their own political aims.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=46}}

==Exile and return==
In 60 BC, Julius Caesar invited Cicero to be the fourth member of his existing partnership with Pompey and Marcus Licinius Crassus, an assembly that would eventually be called the [[First Triumvirate]]. Cicero refused the invitation because he suspected it would undermine the Republic,<ref>Rawson, E.: ''Cicero'', 1984 106</ref> and because he was strongly opposed to anything unconstitutional that limited the powers of the consuls and replaced them with non-elected officials.

During Caesar's consulship of 59 BC, the triumvirate had achieved many of their goals of land reform, publicani debt forgiveness, ratification of Pompeian conquests, etc. With Caesar leaving for his provinces, they wished to maintain their hold on politics. They engineered the adoption of patrician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] into a plebeian family and had him elected as one of the ten [[tribunes of the plebs]] for 58 BC.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=51}} Clodius used the triumvirate's backing to push through legislation that benefited them. He introduced several laws (the ''[[leges Clodiae]]'') that made him popular with the people, strengthening his power base, then he turned on Cicero. Clodius passed a law which made it illegal to offer "fire and water" (i.e. shelter or food) to anyone who executed a Roman citizen without a trial.  
Cicero, having executed members of the Catiline conspiracy four years previously without formal trial, was clearly the intended target.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=50}} Furthermore, many believed that Clodius acted in concert with the triumvirate who feared that Cicero would seek to abolish many of Caesar's accomplishments while consul the year before. Cicero argued that the ''senatus consultum ultimum'' indemnified him from punishment, and he attempted to gain the support of the senators and consuls, especially of Pompey.<ref>Tom Holland, ''Rubicon'', pp. 237–239.</ref>

Cicero grew out his hair, dressed in mourning and toured the streets. Clodius' gangs dogged him, hurling abuse, stones and even excrement. Hortensius, trying to rally to his old rival's support, was almost lynched. The Senate and the consuls were cowed. Caesar, who was still encamped near Rome, was apologetic but said he could do nothing when Cicero brought himself to grovel in the proconsul's tent. Everyone seemed to have abandoned Cicero.<ref>Tom Holland, ''Rubicon'', pp. 238–239.</ref>

After Clodius passed a law to deny to Cicero fire and water (i.e. shelter) within four hundred miles of Rome, Cicero went into exile.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=50}} He arrived at [[Thessalonica]], on 23 May 58&nbsp;BC.<ref>Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', (1964) p. 200</ref><ref>Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', (1964) p. 201</ref><ref>Plutarch.

Cicero's exile caused him to fall into depression. He wrote to Atticus: "Your pleas have prevented me from committing suicide. But what is there to live for? Don't blame me for complaining. My afflictions surpass any you ever heard of earlier".<ref>Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'' (1964) p. 201</ref> After the intervention of recently elected tribune [[Titus Annius Milo]], acting on the behalf of Pompey who wanted Cicero as a [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client]],{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=50}} the Senate voted in favor of recalling Cicero from exile. Clodius cast the single vote against the decree. Cicero returned to Italy on 5 August 57&nbsp;BC, landing at [[Brundisium]].<ref>Cicero, ''Samtliga brev/Collected letters'' (in a Swedish translation)</ref> He was greeted by a cheering crowd, and, to his delight, his beloved daughter Tullia.<ref>Haskell. H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', p. 204</ref> In his ''Oratio De Domo Sua Ad Pontifices'', Cicero convinced the [[College of Pontiffs]] to rule that the consecration of his land was invalid, thereby allowing him to regain his property and rebuild his house on the Palatine.{{sfn|Everitt|2001|p=[https://archive.org/details/cicerolifetimeso00ever/page/165 165]}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cicero |url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0020:text%3DDom.:chapter%3D1 |title=De Domo Sua |publisher=perseus.tufts.edu |access-date=20 February 2021 |archive-date=17 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117035405/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0020%3Atext%3DDom.%3Achapter%3D1 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Cicero tried to re-enter politics as an independent operator,{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=50}} but his attempts to attack portions of Caesar's legislation were unsuccessful{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=51}} and encouraged Caesar to re-solidify his political alliance with Pompey and Crassus.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=52}} The [[Lucca Conference|conference at Luca]] in 56&nbsp;BC left the three-man alliance in domination of the republic's politics; this forced Cicero to recant and support the triumvirate out of fear from being entirely excluded from public life.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=53}} After the conference, Cicero lavishly praised Caesar's achievements, got the Senate to vote a thanksgiving for Caesar's victories, and grant money to pay his troops.{{sfn|Everitt|2001|p=281–283}} He also delivered a speech 'On the consular provinces' ({{Langx|la|de provinciis consularibus|lit=}}){{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=53}} which checked an attempt by Caesar's enemies to strip him of his provinces in Gaul.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p. 144.</ref> After this, a cowed Cicero concentrated on his literary works. It is uncertain whether he was directly involved in politics for the following few years.<ref>Grant, M: ''Cicero: Selected Works'', p. 67</ref> His legal work largely consisted of defending allies of the ruling {{Lang|la|triumvirs|italic=no}} and his own personal friends and allies; [[Pro Caelio|he defended]] his former pupil [[Marcus Caelius Rufus]] against a charge of murder in 56.{{Refn|{{cite book| last=Englert| first=Walter| year=2010| chapter=Cicero| editor-last=Gagarin| editor-first=Michael| title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome| publisher=Oxford University Press| place=Oxford| isbn=9780195388398| chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780195170726.001.0001/acref-9780195170726-e-253?rskey=R67z5t&result=6| access-date=2024-07-23| via=Oxford Reference| chapter-url-access=subscription}} On Caelius's case, see {{cite book| last=Berry| first=Dominic H.| year=2020| title=Cicero's Catilinarians| publisher=Oxford University Press| place=Oxford| isbn=9780195326468|page=xx}}.}} Under the influence of the triumvirs, he had also defended his former enemies [[Publius Vatinius]] (in August 54&nbsp;BCE), [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]] (between July and September) and Gnaeus Plancius (with the {{Lang|la|[[Pro Plancio]]}}) in September, which weakened his prestige and sparked attacks on his integrity: Luca Grillo has suggested these cases as the source of the poet [[Catullus]]'s double-edged comment that Cicero was "the best defender of anybody".{{Refn|{{cite journal| last=Grillo| first=Luca| year=2014| title=A Double ''Sermocinatio'' and a Resolved Dilemma in Cicero's ''Pro Plancio''| journal=The Classical Quarterly| volume=64| issue=1| eissn=1471-6844| page=215| doi=10.1017/S0009838813000669| jstor=26546296}}, quoting Catullus 49.7.}}

==Governorship of Cilicia==
[[File:M. Tullius Cicero, Apamea Cibotus, AR cistophorus, 51-50 BC, Metcalf 470.jpg|thumb|[[Cistophorus]] minted by Cicero in [[Apamea (Phrygia)|Apamea Cibotus]] in 51–50 BC, while serving as proconsul of Cilicia.{{Sfn|Stumpf|1991|p=54}}]]
In 51 BC he reluctantly accepted a [[promagistracy]] (as proconsul) in [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Cilicia]] for the year; there were few other former consuls eligible as a result of a legislative requirement enacted by Pompey in 52&nbsp;BC specifying an interval of five years between a consulship or praetorship and a [[Roman province|provincial command]].{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=59}}{{sfn|Everitt|2001|pp=186–88}} He served as proconsul of Cilicia from May 51 BC, arriving in the provinces three months later around August.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=59}}

In 53 BC Marcus Licinius Crassus had been defeated by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. This opened the Roman East for a Parthian invasion, causing unrest in Syria and Cilicia. Cicero restored calm by his mild system of government. He discovered that a great amount of public property had been embezzled by corrupt previous governors and members of their staff, and did his utmost to restore it. Thus he greatly improved the condition of the cities.<ref>[[Alfred John Church]], ''Roman Life in the Days of Cicero'', (Kindle edition), ch. XIII., loc. 1834</ref> He retained the civil rights of, and exempted from penalties, the men who gave the property back.<ref>Church, loc. 1871</ref> Besides this, he was extremely frugal in his outlays for staff and private expenses during his governorship, and this made him highly popular among the natives.<ref>Church, loc. 1834</ref>

Besides his activity in ameliorating the hard pecuniary situation of the province, Cicero was also creditably active in the military sphere. Early in his governorship he received information that prince [[Pacorus I|Pacorus]], son of [[Orodes II]] the king of the Parthians, had crossed the [[Euphrates]], and was ravaging the Syrian countryside and had even besieged [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] (the interim Roman commander in Syria) in [[Antioch]].<ref>Church, loc. 1845; Gareth C. Sampson, ''The defeat of Rome, Crassus, Carrhae & the invasion of the East'', pp. 155–158; Cicero, ''Letters to friends'', 15.3.1.</ref> Cicero eventually marched with two understrength legions and a large contingent of auxiliary cavalry to Cassius's relief. Pacorus and his army had already given up on besieging Antioch and were heading south through Syria, ravaging the countryside again. Cassius and his legions followed them, harrying them wherever they went, eventually ambushing and defeating them near Antigonea.<ref>Gareth C. Sampson, ''The defeat of Rome, Crassus, Carrhae & the invasion of the East'', p. 159; Cicero, ''Letters to friends'', 2.10.2.</ref>

Another large troop of Parthian horsemen was defeated by Cicero's cavalry who happened to run into them while scouting ahead of the main army. Cicero next defeated some robbers who were based on [[Mount Amanus]] and was hailed as [[imperator]] by his troops. Afterwards he led his army against the independent Cilician mountain tribes, besieging their fortress of [[Pindenissum]]. It took him 47 days to reduce the place, which fell in December.<ref>Church, loc. 1855</ref> On 30 July 50 BC Cicero left the province{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=62}} to his brother [[Quintus Cicero|Quintus]], who had accompanied him on his governorship as his [[Legatus|legate]].<ref>Church, ibid</ref> On his way back to Rome he stopped in Rhodes and then went to Athens, where he caught up with his old friend Titus Pomponius Atticus and met men of great learning.<ref>Plutarch, The Life of Cicero, 36.</ref>

==Julius Caesar's civil war==
Cicero arrived in Rome on 4 January 49 BC.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=62}} He stayed outside the [[pomerium]], to retain his promagisterial powers: either in expectation of a triumph or to retain his independent command authority in the coming civil war.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=62}} The struggle between Pompey and Julius Caesar grew more intense in 50 BC. Cicero favored Pompey, seeing him as a defender of the senate and Republican tradition, but at that time avoided openly alienating Caesar.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/caesar*.html |title=Life of Caesar |last=Plutarch |website=University of Chicago |page=575 |quote=It was Cicero who proposed the first honours for [Caesar] in the senate, and their magnitude was, after all, not too great for a man; but others added excessive honours and vied with one another in proposing them, thus rendering Caesar odious and obnoxious even to the mildest citizens because of the pretension and extravagance of what was decreed for him. |access-date=19 February 2021 |archive-date=13 February 2018 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20180213130122/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/caesar%2A.html |url-status=live }}</ref> When Caesar invaded Italy in 49 BC, Cicero fled Rome.

Eventually, he provoked the hostility of his fellow senator Cato, who told him that he would have been of more use to the cause of the ''optimates'' if he had stayed in Rome. After Caesar's victory at the Battle of Pharsalus on 9 August, Cicero refused to take command of the Pompeian forces and continue the war.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=63}} He returned to Rome, still as a promagistrate with his [[lictor]]s, in 47 BC, and dismissed them upon his crossing the pomerium and renouncing his command.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=63}}

In a letter to [[Varro]] on {{Circa|20 April 46 BC}}, Cicero outlined his strategy under Caesar's dictatorship. Cicero, however, was taken by surprise when the ''Liberatores'' assassinated Caesar on the [[ides of March]], 44 BC. Cicero was not included in the conspiracy, even though the conspirators were sure of his sympathy.

In April 43 BC, "diehard republicans" may have revived the ancient position of ''[[princeps senatus]]'' (leader of the senate) for Cicero. This position had been very prestigious until the [[constitutional reforms of Sulla]] in 82–80 BC, which removed most of its importance.<ref>Ryan, ''Rank and Participation'', pp. 200–203.</ref>

On the other side, Antony was consul and leader of the Caesarian faction, and unofficial executor of Caesar's public will. Relations between the two were never friendly and worsened after Cicero claimed that Antony was taking liberties in interpreting Caesar's wishes and intentions. Octavian was Caesar's adopted son and heir. After he returned to Italy, Cicero began to play him against Antony. He praised Octavian, declaring he would not make the same mistakes as his father. He attacked Antony in a series of speeches he called the [[Philippicae|''Philippics'']],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/whic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?zid=5f8cc5dc35ef36395a3da25a000441ad&action=2&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CCX2878000037&userGroupName=ein_remote&jsid=c02d33644f4e1beaed19877135f2bf8c |title=World History in Context |website=ic.galegroup.com |language=en |access-date=3 January 2018 |archive-date=19 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240619065545/https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=WHIC&u=ein_remote&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CCX2878000037&asid=1718856000000~331bb947 |url-status=live }}</ref> named after Demosthenes's denunciations of [[Philip II of Macedon]].

Cicero supported [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]] as governor of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (''Gallia Cisalpina'') and urged the Senate to name Antony an enemy of the state. The speech of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Piso]], Caesar's father-in-law, delayed proceedings against Antony. Antony was later declared an [[enemy of the state]] when he refused to lift the siege of [[Mutina]], which was in the hands of Decimus Brutus. Cicero's plan to drive out Antony failed. Antony and Octavian reconciled and allied with [[Lepidus]] to form the Second Triumvirate after the successive battles of [[Battle of Forum Gallorum|Forum Gallorum]] and [[Battle of Mutina|Mutina]].  The alliance came into official existence with the ''[[lex Titia]]'', passed on 27 November 43 BC, which gave each triumvir a consular ''[[imperium]]'' for five years. The Triumvirate immediately began a proscription of their enemies, modeled after [[Sulla's proscription|that of Sulla]] in 82 BC. Cicero and all of his contacts and supporters were numbered among the enemies of the state, even though Octavian argued for two days against Cicero being added to the list.<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#46.3 46.3–5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240131100133/https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero%2A.html#46.3 |date=31 January 2024 }}</ref>
[[File:Assassinat de Cicéron.jpg|thumb|Cicero's death (France, 15th century)]]
Cicero was one of the most viciously and doggedly hunted among the proscribed. He was viewed with sympathy by a large segment of the public and many people refused to report that they had seen him. He was caught on 7 December 43&nbsp;BC leaving his villa in [[Formiae]] in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] heading to the seaside, where he hoped to embark on a ship destined for Macedonia.<ref name="Haskell_1964_293">Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'' (1964) p. 293</ref> When his killers – Herennius (a Centurion) and Popilius (a Tribune) – arrived, Cicero's own slaves said they had not seen him, but he was given away by Philologus, a [[freedman]] of his brother Quintus Cicero.<ref name="Haskell_1964_293" />

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|Cicero about age&nbsp;60, from a marble bust]]

As reported by [[Seneca the Elder]], according to the historian [[Aufidius Bassus]], Cicero's last words are said to have been:
{{Blockquote
|text={{lang|la|Ego vero consisto. Accede, veterane, et, si hoc saltim potes recte facere, incide cervicem.}}<br />I go no further: approach, veteran soldier, and, if you can at least do so much properly, sever this neck.<ref>Seneca, ''Suasoria'' 6:18 (http://www.attalus.org/translate/suasoria6.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240116063553/http://www.attalus.org/translate/suasoria6.html |date=16 January 2024 }})</ref>
}}
He bowed to his captors, leaning his head out of the litter in a gladiatorial gesture to ease the task. By baring his neck and throat to the soldiers, he was indicating that he would not resist. According to Plutarch, Herennius first slew him, then cut off his head. On Antony's instructions his hands, which had penned the Philippics against Antony, were cut off as well; these were nailed along with his head on the [[Rostra]] in the Forum Romanum according to the tradition of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] and Sulla, both of whom had displayed the heads of their enemies in the Forum. Cicero was the only victim of the proscriptions who was displayed in that manner. According to [[Cassius Dio]], in a story often mistakenly attributed to Plutarch,<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/47*.html#8.4 47.8.4] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210327022845/https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/47%2A.html#8.4 |date=27 March 2021 }}</ref> Antony's wife [[Fulvia]] took Cicero's head, pulled out his tongue, and jabbed it repeatedly with her hairpin in final revenge against Cicero's power of speech.<ref>{{harvnb|Everitt|2001}}.{{page needed |date=November 2023}}</ref>

Cicero's son, Marcus Tullius Cicero Minor, during his year as a consul in 30 BC, avenged his father's death, to a certain extent, when he announced to the Senate Mark Antony's naval defeat at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]] in 31 BC by Octavian.{{sfn|Everitt|2001|p=302–304}}

Octavian is reported to have praised Cicero as a patriot and a scholar of meaning in later times, within the circle of his family.{{sfn|Plut. ''Cic.''|loc=49.5}} However, it was Octavian's acquiescence that had allowed Cicero to be killed, as Cicero was condemned by the new triumvirate.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Baños|first=José|date=26 February 2019|title=The brutal beheading of Cicero, last defender of the Roman Republic|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/2019/02/brutal-beheading-cicero-last-defender-roman-republic|url-status=live|access-date=15 March 2021|website=National Geographic|language=en-gb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210319000211/https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/2019/02/brutal-beheading-cicero-last-defender-roman-republic |archive-date=19 March 2021 }}</ref>

Cicero's career as a statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes in the political climate. His indecision may be attributed to his sensitive and impressionable personality; he was prone to overreaction in the face of political and private change.{{sfn|Rawson|1975|p=203–205}} "Would that he had been able to endure prosperity with greater self-control, and adversity with more fortitude!" wrote [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|C.

== Personal life and family ==
{{further|Personal life of Cicero}}

Cicero married [[Terentia]] probably at the age of 27, in 79 BC. According to the [[upper-class]] [[wikt:mores#English|mores]] of the day it was a marriage of convenience but lasted harmoniously for nearly 30 years. Terentia's family was wealthy, probably the [[plebeian]] noble house of Terenti Varrones, thus meeting the needs of Cicero's political ambitions in both economic and social terms. She had a half-sister named Fabia, who as a child had become a [[Vestal Virgin]], a great honour. Terentia was a strong-willed woman and (citing Plutarch) "took more interest in her husband's political career than she allowed him to take in household affairs".{{sfn|Rawson|1975|p=25}}

In the 50s BC, Cicero's letters to Terentia became shorter and colder. He complained to his friends that Terentia had betrayed him but did not specify in which sense. Perhaps the marriage could not outlast the strain of the political upheaval in Rome, Cicero's involvement in it, and various other disputes between the two. The divorce appears to have taken place in 51 BC or shortly before.{{sfn|Treggiari|2007|pp=76ff}} In 46 or 45 BC,{{sfn|Treggiari|2007|p=133}} Cicero married a young girl, Publilia, who had been his [[ward (law)|ward]]. It is thought that Cicero needed her money, particularly after having to repay the [[dowry]] of Terentia, who came from a wealthy family.<ref name="Rawson_1975_225">{{harvnb|Rawson|1975|p=225}}.</ref>

Although his marriage to Terentia was one of convenience, it is commonly known that Cicero held great love for his daughter [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia]].<ref>Haskell H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', p. 95</ref> When she suddenly became ill in February 45 BC and died after having seemingly recovered from giving birth to a son in January, Cicero was stunned. "I have lost the one thing that bound me to life," he wrote to Atticus.<ref name="Haskell_1964_249">Haskell, H.J.: "This was Cicero" (1964) p. 249</ref> Atticus told him to come for a visit during the first weeks of his [[bereavement]], so that he could comfort him when his pain was at its greatest. In Atticus's large library, Cicero read everything that the [[Greek philosophers]] had written about overcoming grief, "but my sorrow defeats all consolation."<ref>Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'', 12.14. Rawson, E.: ''Cicero'' p. 225</ref> Caesar and [[Brutus]], as well as Servius Sulpicius Rufus, sent him letters of condolence.<ref>Rawson, E.: ''Cicero'' p. 226</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Samtliga brev/Collected letters''</ref>

Cicero hoped that his son [[Cicero Minor|Marcus]] would become a philosopher like him, but Marcus himself wished for a [[military career]]. He joined the army of [[Pompey]] in 49 BC, and after Pompey's defeat at [[Battle of Pharsalus|Pharsalus]] 48 BC, he was pardoned by Caesar. Cicero sent him to Athens to study as a disciple of the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosopher [[Cratippus of Pergamon|Kratippos]] in 48 BC, but he used this absence from "his father's vigilant eye" to "eat, drink, and be merry."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Haskell |first=H.J |title=This was Cicero |year=1964 |pages=103–104}}</ref> After Cicero's death, he joined the army of the ''[[Liberatores]]'' but was later pardoned by [[Augustus]]. Augustus's bad [[conscience]] for having given in to Cicero's being put on the [[proscription]] list during the [[Second Triumvirate]] led him to aid considerably Marcus Minor's career. He became an [[augur]] and was nominated [[Roman consul|consul]] in 30 BC together with Augustus. As such, he was responsible for revoking the honors of [[Mark Antony]], who was responsible for the proscription and could in this way take revenge. Later he was appointed [[proconsul]] of [[Syria]] and the province of Asia.<ref>Paavo Castren & L. Pietilä-Castren: ''Antiikin käsikirja/Encyclopedia of the Ancient World''</ref>

Cicero has been traditionally considered the master of Latin prose, with [[Quintilian]] declaring that Cicero was "not the name of a man, but of eloquence itself."<ref>Quintilian, [[Institutio Oratoria]] 10.1.112</ref> The English words ''[[wikt:Ciceronian|Ciceronian]]'' (meaning "eloquent") and ''[[wikt:cicerone|cicerone]]'' (meaning "local guide") derive from his name.<ref>{{OEtymD|Ciceronian}}</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|cicerone}}</ref> He is credited with transforming Latin from a modest utilitarian language into a versatile literary medium capable of expressing abstract and complicated thoughts with clarity.<ref>''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature'', "Ciceronian period" (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&pg=PA244 p. 244]</ref> Julius Caesar praised Cicero's achievement by saying "it is more important to have greatly extended the frontiers of the Roman spirit than the frontiers of the Roman empire".<ref>Pliny, ''Natural History'', 7.117</ref> According to [[John William Mackail]], "Cicero's unique and imperishable glory is that he created the language of the civilized world, and used that language to create a style which nineteen centuries have not replaced, and in some respects have hardly altered."<ref>Cicero, ''Seven orations'', 1912</ref>

Cicero was also an energetic writer with an interest in a wide variety of subjects, in keeping with the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophical]] and rhetorical traditions in which he was trained. The quality and ready accessibility of Ciceronian texts favored very wide distribution and inclusion in teaching curricula, as suggested by a graffito at Pompeii, admonishing: "You will like Cicero, or you will be whipped".<ref>Hasan Niyazi, ''From Pompeii to Cyberspace – Transcending barriers with Twitter'' {{Cite web |url=http://www.3pipe.net/2011/05/from-pompeii-to-cyberspace-transcending.html |title=Account Suspended |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114062841/http://www.3pipe.net/2011/05/from-pompeii-to-cyberspace-transcending.html |archive-date=14 November 2012 |access-date=7 September 2012}}</ref>

Cicero was greatly admired by influential [[Church Fathers]] such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], who credited Cicero's [[Lost literary work|lost]] ''[[Hortensius (Cicero)|Hortensius]]'' for his eventual conversion to Christianity,<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 3:4</ref> and St. [[Jerome]], who had a feverish vision in which he was accused of being "follower of Cicero and not of Christ" before the judgment seat.<ref>Jerome, ''Letter to Eustochium'', XXII:30</ref>

This influence further increased after the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Early Middle Ages]] in Europe, where more of his writings survived than any other Latin author. Medieval philosophers were influenced by Cicero's writings on [[natural law]] and innate rights.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Goodey |first=C.F. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgaiAgAAQBAJ&q=Medieval+philosophers+were+influenced+by+Cicero%27s+writings+on+natural+law+and+innate+rights.&pg=PA154 |title=A History of Intelligence and 'Intellectual Disability': The Shaping of Psychology in Early Modern Europe |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4094-8235-2 |language=en |access-date=25 October 2020 |archive-date=19 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240619065550/https://books.google.com/books?id=zgaiAgAAQBAJ&q=Medieval+philosophers+were+influenced+by+Cicero%27s+writings+on+natural+law+and+innate+rights.&pg=PA154#v=onepage&q=Medieval%20philosophers%20were%20influenced%20by%20Cicero's%20writings%20on%20natural%20law%20and%20innate%20rights.&f=false |url-status=live }}{{page needed|date=December 2020}}</ref>{{additional citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Petrarch]]'s rediscovery of Cicero's letters provided the impetus for searches for ancient Greek and Latin writings scattered throughout European monasteries, and the subsequent rediscovery of [[classical antiquity]] led to the [[Renaissance]]. Subsequently, Cicero became synonymous with classical Latin to such an extent that a number of humanist scholars began to assert that no Latin word or phrase should be used unless it appeared in Cicero's works, a stance criticised by [[Erasmus]].<ref>Erasmus, [[Ciceronianus]]</ref>

His voluminous correspondence, much of it addressed to his friend Atticus, has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European culture. [[Cornelius Nepos]], the first century BC biographer of Atticus, remarked that Cicero's letters contained such a wealth of detail "concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government" that their reader had little need for a history of the period.<ref>Cornelius Nepos, ''[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nepos.htm#Atticus Atticus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233658/http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nepos.htm#Atticus |date=7 November 2017 }}'' 16, trans.

Cicero was especially popular with the [[Philosophes]] of the 18th century, including [[Edward Gibbon]], [[Diderot]], [[David Hume]], [[Montesquieu]], and [[Voltaire]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Peter Gay |title=The Enlightenment: An Interpretation |publisher=W.W.

Voltaire called Cicero "the greatest as well as the most elegant of Roman philosophers" and even staged a play based on Cicero's role in the [[Catilinarian conspiracy]], called ''Rome Sauvée, ou Catilina'', to "make young people who go to the theatre acquainted with Cicero."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Peter Gay |title=The Enlightenment: An Interpretation |publisher=W.W.

{{Main|Writings of Cicero}}
Cicero was declared a [[righteous pagan]] by the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Early Church]].{{sfn|Everitt|2001|p=259}} Subsequent Roman and medieval Christian writers quoted liberally from his works ''[[De re publica]]'' (''On the Commonwealth'') and ''[[De Legibus]]'' (''On the Laws''), and much of his work has been recreated from these surviving fragments. Cicero also articulated an early, abstract conceptualization of rights, based on ancient law and custom. Of Cicero's books, six on rhetoric have survived, as well as parts of seven on philosophy.<ref name=Herrick>{{cite book |last1=A.

==In archaeology==
Cicero's great repute in Italy has led to numerous ruins being identified as having belonged to him, though none have been substantiated with absolute certainty. In [[Formia]], two Roman-era ruins are popularly believed to be Cicero's mausoleum, the ''Tomba di Cicerone'', and the villa where he was assassinated in 43 BC. The latter building is centered around a central hall with Doric columns and a coffered vault, with a separate [[nymphaeum]], on five acres of land near Formia.<ref>{{Cite news |last=L.

Cicero's supposed tomb is a 24-meter (79 feet) tall tower on an ''[[opus quadratum]]'' base on the ancient Via Appia outside of Formia. Some suggest that it is not in fact Cicero's tomb, but a monument built on the spot where Cicero was intercepted and assassinated while trying to reach the sea.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Redazione ANSA |url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2015/07/21/mayor-launches-appeal-to-save-ciceros-villa-from-ruin_55a57cf3-5104-4a1a-8e19-bc4cd3261dbd.html |title=Mayor launches appeal to save Cicero's villa from ruin |date=25 July 2015 |access-date=19 June 2018 |publisher=ANSA English |archive-date=19 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619085928/http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2015/07/21/mayor-launches-appeal-to-save-ciceros-villa-from-ruin_55a57cf3-5104-4a1a-8e19-bc4cd3261dbd.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In [[Pompeii]], a large villa excavated in the mid 18th century just outside the Herculaneum Gate was widely believed to have been Cicero's, who was known to have owned a holiday villa in Pompeii he called his ''Pompeianum''. The villa was stripped of its fine frescoes and mosaics and then re-buried after 1763 – it has yet to be re-excavated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pompeiiinpictures.com/pompeiiinpictures/RV/Villa%20Cicero.htm |title=Villa Cicero |publisher=pompeiiinpictures.com |access-date=19 June 2018 |archive-date=23 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623121845/http://pompeiiinpictures.com/pompeiiinpictures/RV/Villa%20Cicero.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> However, contemporaneous descriptions of the building from the excavators combined with Cicero's own references to his ''Pompeianum'' differ, making it unlikely that it is Cicero's villa.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mary Beard |title=The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=2010 |page=45}}</ref>

In Rome, the location of Cicero's house has been roughly identified from excavations of the Republican-era stratum on the northwestern slope of the Palatine Hill.<ref name="rome_alive">{{Cite book |last=Bolchazy-Carducci |title=Rome Alive: A Source Guide to the Ancient City |year=2004 |page=Vol. 1.5}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/AK_GE/AK_HTML/GF-014.html |title=Palatine Hill |publisher=archive1.village.virginia.edu |access-date=20 June 2018 |archive-date=14 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814134918/http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/AK_GE/AK_HTML/GF-014.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Cicero's ''domus'' has long been known to have stood in the area, according to his own descriptions and those of later authors, but there is some debate about whether it stood near the base of the hill, very close to the Roman Forum, or nearer to the summit.<ref name="rome_alive" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Filippo Coarelli |title=Rome and Environs: An Archaeological Guide |year=2014 |page=93}}</ref> During his life the area was the most desirable in Rome, densely occupied with Patrician houses including the ''Domus Publica'' of Julius Caesar and the home of Cicero's mortal enemy Clodius.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Samuel Ball Platner & Thomas Ashby |title=Palatinus Mons, Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1929}}</ref>

In the historical novel series ''[[Masters of Rome]]'', [[Colleen McCullough]] presents a not-so-flattering depiction of Cicero's career, showing him struggling with an inferiority complex and vanity, morally flexible and fatally indiscreet, while his rival Julius Caesar is shown in a more approving light.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://haciendapublishing.com/articles/caesars-women-%25E2%2580%2594-mcculloughs-idolatry-and-politics-ancient-rome |title=Caesar's Women – McCullough's Idolatry and Politics in Ancient Rome |last=Faria |first=Miguel A. |date=14 August 2013 |website=Hacienda Publishing |access-date=5 December 2018 |archive-date=6 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206002036/https://haciendapublishing.com/articles/caesars-women-%25E2%2580%2594-mcculloughs-idolatry-and-politics-ancient-rome |url-status=dead }}</ref> Cicero is portrayed as a hero in the novel ''[[A Pillar of Iron]]'' by [[Taylor Caldwell]] (1965).
