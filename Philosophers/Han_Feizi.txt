==Introduction==
[[File:Harvard drs 53759706 韓非子 卷第九.pdf|thumb|Pages from a printed edition of ''Han Feizi'' from the Ming dynasty]]
Han Fei describes an interest-driven human nature together with the political methodologies to work with it in the interest of the state and Sovereign, namely, engaging in [[wu wei|passive observation]], and the systematic use of ''[[Fa (philosophy)|fa]]'' ({{lang-zh|c=法|p=fǎ|labels=no|l=law', 'measurement}}) to maintain leadership and manage human resources, its use to increase welfare, and its relation with justice.

Rather than rely too much on worthies, who might not be trustworthy, Han Fei binds their programs to systematic reward and penalty (the 'two handles'), fishing the subjects of the state by feeding them with interests. That being done, the ruler minimizes his own input, intending to make no judgement apart from observances of the facts.  Like Shang Yang and other ''fa'' philosophers, he admonishes the ruler not to abandon ''fa'' for any other means, considering it a more practical means for the administration of both a large territory and personnel near at hand.

Han Fei's philosophy proceeds from the regicide of his era. Sinologist Goldin writes: "Most of what appears in the ''Han Feizi'' deals with the ruler's relations with his ministers, [who] were regarded as the party most likely, in practice, to cause him harm." Han Fei quotes the ''Springs and Autumns of Tao Zuo'': "'Less than half of all rulers die of illness.' If the ruler of men is unaware of this, disorders will be manifold and unrestrained. Thus it is said: If those who benefit from a lord's death are many, the ruler will be imperiled.".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Home &#124; East Asian Languages and Civilizations|url=https://ealc.sas.upenn.edu/|access-date=2022-01-05|website=ealc.sas.upenn.edu}}</ref><ref>2018 Henrique Schneider. p.vii.

==''Wu wei''==
Devoting the entirety of Chapter 14, "How to Love the Ministers", to "persuading the ruler to be ruthless to his ministers", Han Fei's enlightened ruler strikes terror into his ministers by doing nothing (''wu wei''). Discarding his private reason and morality, he shows no personal feelings. The qualities of a ruler, his "mental power, moral excellence and physical prowess" are not as important as his method of government. ''Fa'' require no perfection on the part of the ruler.<ref name=Chen1975>{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Ellen Marie |title=The Dialectic of Chih (Reason) and Tao (Nature) in The ''Han Fei-Tzu'' |journal=Journal of Chinese Philosophy |date=December 1975 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–21 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6253.1975.tb00378.x }}</ref>

If the Han Fei's ''[[wu wei]]'' was derivative of a proto-Daoism, its Dao nonetheless emphasizes autocracy ("Tao does not identify with anything but itself, the ruler does not identify with the ministers"). Accepting that the Han Feizi applies ''wu wei'' specifically to statecraft, professor Xing Lu nonetheless argues that it actually does consider ''wu wei'' a virtue, and not just a tool or argument for the ruler to reduce activity and act impartially. The Han Feizi says, "by virtue [''[[de (philosophy)|de]]''] of resting empty and reposed, he waits for the course of nature to enforce itself."<ref>Xing Lu 1998. Rhetoric in Ancient China, Fifth to Third Century, B.C.E.. [https://books.google.com/books?id=72QURrAppzkC&pg=PA264 p.&nbsp;264.]</ref><ref>Roger T. Ames 1983. p.&nbsp;50. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OkTurZP__qAC&pg=PA50 The Art of Rulership.]</ref> As one of the work's first chapters, Han Fei's chapter five begins by advising the ruler to remain "empty and still".

{{Blockquote
|text=[[Tao]] is the beginning of the myriad things, the standard of right and wrong. That being so, the intelligent ruler, by holding to the beginning, knows the source of everything, and, by keeping to the standard, knows the origin of good and evil. Therefore, by virtue of resting empty and reposed, he waits for the course of nature to enforce itself so that all names will be defined of themselves and all affairs will be settled of themselves. Empty, he knows the essence of fullness: reposed, he becomes the corrector of motion. Who utters a word creates himself a name; who has an affair creates himself a form. Compare forms and names and see if they are identical. Then the ruler will find nothing to worry about as everything is reduced to its reality.

Tao exists in invisibility; its function, in unintelligibility. Be empty and reposed and have nothing to do-Then from the dark see defects in the light. See but never be seen. Hear but never be heard. Know but never be known. If you hear any word uttered, do not change it nor move it but compare it with the deed and see if word and deed coincide with each other. Place every official with a censor. Do not let them speak to each other. Then everything will be exerted to the utmost. Cover tracks and conceal sources. Then the ministers cannot trace origins. Leave your wisdom and cease your ability. Then your subordinates cannot guess at your limitations.

The bright ruler is undifferentiated and quiescent in waiting, causing names (roles) to define themselves and affairs to fix themselves. If he is undifferentiated then he can understand when actuality is pure, and if he is quiescent then he can understand when movement is correct.<ref>http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/hanfei.xml&style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&chunk.id=d2.5&toc.depth=1&toc.id=0&doc.lang=bilingual

Though recommending use of [[Shen Buhai]]'s techniques, Han Fei's ''xing-ming'' is both considerably narrower and more specific. The functional dichotomy implied in Han Fei's mechanistic accountability is not readily implied in Shen's, and might be said to be more in line with the later thought of the Han dynasty linguist [[Xu Gan]] than that of either Shen Buhai or his supposed teacher [[Xun Kuang]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Makeham|first=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GId_ASbEI2YC&pg=PA82|title=Name and Actuality in Early Chinese Thought|date=1994-07-22|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1984-7|language=en}}</ref>

Shang Yang was largely unconcerned with the organization of the bureaucracy apart from this.<ref>Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 100, 102</ref> The use of these "two handles" (punishment and reward) nonetheless forms a primary premise of Han Fei's administrative theory.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dehsen|first=Christian von|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZrbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT400|title=Philosophers and Religious Leaders|date=2013-09-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-95109-2|language=en}}</ref> However, he includes it under his theory of ''shu'' (administrative techniques) in connection with ''xing-ming''.<ref name="Chad Hansen p.367"/>

As a matter of illustration, if the "keeper of the hat" lays a robe on the sleeping Emperor, he has to be put to death for overstepping his office, while the "keeper of the robe" has to be put to death for failing to do his duty.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{Cite book|last=Tamura|first=Eileen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0TQ_Puz-w8C&pg=PA54|title=China: Understanding Its Past|date=1997-01-01|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1923-1|language=en}}</ref> The philosophy of the "Two Handles" likens the ruler to the tiger or leopard, which "overpowers other animals by its sharp teeth and claws" (rewards and punishments). Without them he is like any other man; his existence depends upon them. To "avoid any possibility of usurpation by his ministers", power and the "handles of the law" must "not be shared or divided", concentrating them in the ruler exclusively.

In practice, this means that the ruler must be isolated from his ministers. The elevation of ministers endangers the ruler, from whom he must be kept strictly apart. Punishment confirms his sovereignty; law eliminates anyone who oversteps his boundary, regardless of intention. Law "aims at abolishing the selfish element in man and the maintenance of public order", making the people responsible for their actions.<ref name=Chen1975/>

Han Fei's rare appeal, among Legalists, to the use of scholars (law and method specialists) makes him comparable to the Confucians, in that sense. The ruler cannot inspect all officials himself, and must rely on the decentralized (but faithful) application of ''fa''. Contrary to Shen Buhai and his own rhetoric, Han Fei insists that loyal ministers (like [[Guan Zhong]], [[Shang Yang]], and [[Wu Qi]]) exist, and upon their elevation with maximum authority.

In opposition to Confucian family sentiment, Tao Jiang (2021) takes Han Fei's analysis of family dynamics as based entirely on the position of the ruler, requiring structural solutions rather than Confucian education or moral cultivation. According to the [[Liji]], an "important early Confucian canon", penal laws should not be applied to high officials. As a major source of political corruption, ministers shielded family members from penal measures in the name of Humaneness and others moral justifications. Only those without connections are subject to the law. Although noting an opposition between politic and morality, Tao Jiang takes Han Fei's opposition in this as clearly pointing to a moral dimension in his vision of political order. In what Tao Jiang takes as one of Han Fei's "most powerful condemnation of the gross injustice suffered by the commoners", Han Fei says:<ref>Tao Jiang 2021. p418,420-421</ref>

{{Blockquote | Judging from the tales handed down from high antiquity and the incidents recorded in the Spring and Autumn Annals, those men who violated the laws, committed treason, and carried out major acts of evil always worked through some eminent and highly placed minister. And yet the laws and regulations are customarily designed to prevent evil among the humble and lowly people, and it is upon them alone that penalties and punishments fall. Hence the common people lose hope and are left with no place to air their grievances. Meanwhile the high ministers band together and work as one man to cloud the vision of the ruler.

==Comparisons and views==
Apart from the influence of [[Confucianism|Confucianist]] [[Xun Zi]], who was his and [[Li Si]]'s teacher, because of the ''Han Feizi'''s commentary on the ''[[Daodejing]]'', interpreted as a political text, the Han Feizi has sometimes been included as part of the syncretist [[Huang-Lao]] tradition, seeing the [[Taoism|Tao]] as a natural law that everyone and everything was forced to follow, like a force of nature.

Being older than more recent scholarship, translator W. K. Liao (1960) described the world view of the ''Han Feizi'' as "purely Taoistic", advocating a "doctrine of inaction" nonetheless followed by an "insistence on the active application of the two handles to government", this being the "difference between Han Fei Tzŭ's ideas and the teachings of the orthodox Taoists (who advocated non-action from start to finish)." Liao compares Han Fei's thought to [[Shang Yang]], "directing his main attention... to the issues between ruler and minister... teaching the ruler how to maintain supremacy and why to weaken the minister."<ref>{{Cite web|title=XWomen CONTENT|url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/hanfei.xml&style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&chunk.id=d2.8&toc.depth=1&toc.id=0&doc.lang=bilingual|access-date=2022-01-05|website=www2.iath.virginia.edu}}</ref>

{{ill|Phan Ngọc|vi}} in his foreword to the ''Han Feizi'' praised Han Fei as a knowledgeable man with sharp, logical and firm arguments, supported by large amount of practical and realistic evidence. Han Fei's strict methods were appropriate in a context of social decadence. Phan Ngọc claimed that Han Fei's writings has three drawbacks, however: first, his idea of Legalism was unsuited to autocracy because a ruling dynasty will sooner or later deteriorate. Second, due to the inherent limitation of autocratic monarchy system, Han Fei did not manage to provide the solutions for all the issues that he pointed out. Third, Han Fei was wrong to think that human is inherently evil and only seeks fame and profit: there are humans who sacrificed their own profit for the greater good, including Han Fei himself.<ref>Vietnamese translation, 2011, Nhà Xuất bản Văn Học</ref> {{ill|Trần Ngọc Vương|vi}} considered the ''Han Feizi'' to be superior to Machiavelli's ''[[The Prince|Prince]]'', and claimed that Han Fei's ideology was highly refined for its era.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://antgct.cand.com.vn/Nhan-vat/PGS-–-TS-Tran-Ngoc-Vuong-Nguy-thien-cung-vua-phai-thoi-khong-thi-ai-chiu-duoc-314289/|title=PGS – TS Trần Ngọc Vương: Ngụy thiện cũng vừa phải thôi, không thì ai chịu được!|website=Báo Công an nhân dân điện tử|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>
	
Although considering the ''Han Feizi'' rich and erudite, Sinologist Chad Hansen does not consider Han Fei particularly original, philosophical or ethical" and "more polemical than reasoned", with unjustified assumptions and cynicism recognizable "from all self-described realists", resting on the familiar sneering tone of superior realistic insight."<ref name="auto">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC|title=A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought: A Philosophical Interpretation|first=Chad|last=Hansen|date=August 17, 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195350760|via=Google Books}}</ref>{{rp|346}}
