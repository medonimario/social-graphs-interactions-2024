[[File:John Ray by Roubiliac, British Museum.jpg|thumb|250px|John Ray by [[Roubiliac]], British Museum]]
'''John Ray''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (29 November 1627 – 17 January 1705) was a [[Christian]] [[England|English]] [[Natural history|naturalist]] widely regarded as one of the earliest of the English [[parson-naturalist]]s. Until 1670, he wrote his name as '''John Wray'''. From then on, he used 'Ray', after "having ascertained that such had been the practice of his family before him". He published important works on [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[natural theology]]. His classification of plants in his ''[[Historia Plantarum (Ray book)|Historia Plantarum]]'', was an important step towards modern [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. Ray rejected the system of [[dichotomy|dichotomous]] division by which species were classified by repeated sub-division into groups according to a pre-conceived series of characteristics they have or have not, and instead classified plants according to similarities and differences that emerged from observation. He was among the first to attempt a biological definition for the concept of ''[[species]]'', as "a group of morphologically similar organisms arising from a common ancestor".<ref>''Historia plantarum generalis'', in the volume published in 1686, Tome I, Libr. I, Chap. XX, page 40 (Quoted in Mayr, Ernst. 1982. ''The growth of biological thought: diversity, evolution, and inheritance.'' Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap Press: 256)</ref> Another significant contribution to taxonomy was his division of plants into those with two seedling leaves ([[dicotyledons]]) or only one ([[monocotyledons]]), a division used in taxonomy today.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Atran |first1=Scott |title=Cognitive Foundations of Natural History: Towards an Anthropology of Science |date=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}</ref>

=== Early life ===

[[File:John Ray birthplace's in Black Notley, Essex.jpg|thumb|John Ray's birthplace in Black Notley, Essex]]
[[File:Blue plaque to John Ray.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque to John Ray]]

John Ray was born in the village of [[Black Notley]] in Essex. He is said to have been born in the smithy, his father having been the village [[blacksmith]]. After studying at Braintree school, he was sent at the age of sixteen to Cambridge University: studying at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]].<ref>{{acad|id=RY644J|name=Ray, John}}</ref> Initially at Catharine Hall, his tutor was Daniel Duckfield, and later transferred to Trinity where his tutor was [[James Duport]], and his "intimate friend" and fellow-pupil the celebrated [[Isaac Barrow]]. Ray was chosen minor fellow{{efn|While still a B.A.}} of Trinity in 1649, and later major fellow.{{efn|On attaining his M.A.}} He held many college offices, becoming successively lecturer in Greek (1651), mathematics (1653), and humanity (1655), ''[[praelector]]'' (1657), junior dean (1657), and college steward (1659 and 1660); and according to the habit of the time, he was accustomed to preach in his college chapel and also at [[St Mary the Great with St Michael, Cambridge|Great St Mary's]], long before he took [[holy order]]s on 23 December 1660. Among these sermons were his discourses on ''The wisdom of God manifested in the works of the creation'',<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dxkHAAAAQAAJ ''The wisdom of God manifested in the works of the Creation''], Google Books</ref> and ''Deluge and Dissolution of the World''. Ray was also highly regarded as a tutor and he communicated his own passion for natural history to several pupils.{{sfn|Thompson|1911|p=931}} Ray's student, [[Isaac Barrow]], helped Francis Willughby learn mathematics and Ray collaborated with Willughby later.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mullens, W.H. |title=Some early British Ornithologists and their works.

=== Later life and family ===

After leaving Cambridge in 1663 he spent some time travelling both in Britain and the continent.{{sfn|Vines|1913}} In 1673, Ray married Margaret Oakley of [[Launton]] in Oxfordshire; in 1676 he went to [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire|Middleton Hall]] near [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], and in 1677 to Falborne (or [[Faulkbourne]]) Hall in Essex. Finally, in 1679, he removed to his birthplace at [[Black Notley]], where he afterwards remained. His life there was quiet and uneventful, although he had poor health, including chronic sores.{{sfn|Thompson|1911|p=932}} Ray kept writing books and corresponded widely on scientific matters, collaborating with his doctor and contemporary [[Samuel Dale (physician)|Samuel Dale]].<ref name=sage>Morris, A. D. (1974). Samuel Dale (1659-1739), Physician and Geologist. Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, 67, 120–124. Retrieved from https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/003591577406700215</ref> He lived, in spite of his infirmities, to the age of seventy-seven, dying at Black Notley. He is buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul where there is a memorial to him. He is widely regarded as one of the earliest of the English [[parson-naturalist]]s.{{sfn|Armstrong|2000|loc=pp.&nbsp;45''ff''}}

[[File:Ray, John – Synopsis methodica stirpium britannicarum, 1690 – BEIC 8764527.jpg|thumb|''Synopsis methodica stirpium britannicarum'', 1690]]
At Cambridge, Ray spent much of his time in the study of [[natural history]], a subject which would occupy him for most of his life, from 1660 to the beginning of the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Slaughter|1982|loc=p.&nbsp;62}}{{sfn|Vines|1913}} When Ray found himself unable to subscribe as required by the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] he, along with 13 other college fellows, resigned his fellowship on 24 August 1662<!--not in source: the year after [[Isaac Newton]] had entered the college--> rather than swear to the declaration that the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] was not binding on those who had taken it.<ref name="DNB00">[[s:Ray, John (DNB00)]]</ref> [[Tobias Smollett]] quoted the reasoning given in the biography of Ray by [[William Derham]]:
{{blockquote|The reason of his refusal was not (says his biographer) as some have imagined, his having taken the solemn league and covenant; for that he never did, and often declared that he ever thought it an unlawful oath: but he said he could not say, for those that had taken the oath, that no obligation lay upon them, but feared there might."<ref>[[Tobias Smollett|Tobias George Smollett]] (1761) ''The Critical review, or, Annals of literature'', Volume 11 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoRHAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93 pp. 92–93]</ref>}}
His religious views were generally in accord with [[Clarendon Code|those imposed]] under the restoration of [[Charles II of England]], and (though technically a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]]) he continued as a layman in the [[Established church|Established]] [[Church of England]].<ref name="DNB00" />

From this time onwards he seems to have depended chiefly on the bounty of his pupil [[Francis Willughby]], who made Ray his constant companion while he lived.{{sfn|Thompson|1911|p=931}} They travelled extensively, carrying out field observations and collecting specimens of botany, ornithology, ichthyology, mammals, reptiles and insects. Initially they agreed that Ray would take responsibility for the plants, and Willughby for birds, beasts, fishes, and insects. Willughby arranged that after his death, Ray would have 6 shillings a year for educating Willughby's two sons.<ref name="Mickel">{{cite journal |last1=Mickel |first1=Clarence E. |title=John Ray: Indefatigable Student of Nature |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |date=January 1973 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.18.010173.000245 |pmid=4617556 |url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.en.18.010173.000245 |access-date=21 February 2023 |language=en |issn=0066-4170}}</ref>

In the spring of 1663 Ray started together with Willughby and two other pupils ([[Philip Skippon (1641-1691)|Philip Skippon]] and [[Nathaniel Bacon (colonist)|Nathaniel Bacon]]<ref name=gribbin2002>{{cite book | author=Gribbin, John | author-link=John Gribbin | title=Science, a History, 1543-2001 | url=https://archive.org/details/sciencehistory150000grib | url-access=registration | publisher=Allen Lane | location=New York | year=2002| isbn=9780713995039 }}</ref>) on a tour through [[Europe]], from which he returned in March 1666, parting from Willughby at [[Montpellier]], whence the latter continued his journey into [[Spain]]. He had previously in three different journeys (1658, 1661, 1662) travelled through the greater part of Great Britain, and selections from his private notes of these journeys were edited by [[George Lewis Scott|George Scott]]<!--Fellow of Society of Antiquaries--> in 1760, under the title of ''Mr Ray's Itineraries''. Ray himself published an account of his foreign travel in 1673, entitled ''Observations topographical, moral, and physiological, made on a Journey through part of the Low Countries, Germany, Italy, and France''. From this tour Ray and Willughby returned laden with collections, on which they meant to base complete systematic descriptions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.<ref name="Mickel"/>{{sfn|Thompson|1911|p=932}}

In 1667 Ray was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society]],<ref name="Mickel"/> and in 1669 he and Willughby published a paper on ''Experiments concerning the Motion of Sap in Trees''.{{sfn|Thompson|1911|p=932}} In 1671, he presented the research of Francis Jessop on [[formic acid]] to the Royal Society.{{sfn|Raven|1950}}

Following Willughby's death in 1672, Ray took on the responsibility of bringing both Willughby's work and his own to publication.  Ray was left with an ornithology and ichthyology to edit as well as his own work dealing with mammals, reptiles and insects. Although he presented the
''Ornithologia'' (1676) as Willughby's, he made extensive contributions to the work. His task became more difficult after the death of Lady Cassandra, Willughby's mother, on July 25, 1675. Lady Cassandra had supported Ray's continued work, but the widow Willughby had no interest in her late husband's scientific interests or his scientific friends. Ray was no longer allowed to instruct the children, and Ray and his wife Margaret Oakley were forced to leave the Willughby household in Middleton. Critically, Ray lost access to the Willughby collections, notes and manuscripts at this time. The plants gathered on his British tours had already been described in his ''Catalogus plantarum Angliae'' (1670), which formed the basis for later English floras. He had likely already used the botanical collections to lay much of the groundwork of his ''Methodus plantarum nova'' (1682),  His great ''Historia generalis plantarum'' appeared in 3 vols. in 1686, 1688, 1704.<ref name="Mickel"/>

In the 1690s, he published three volumes on religion—the most popular being ''The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation'' (1691), an essay describing evidence that all in nature and space is God's creation as in the Bible is affirmed. In this volume, he moved on from the naming and cataloguing of species like his successor [[Carl Linnaeus]]. Instead, Ray considered species' lives and how nature worked as a whole, giving facts that are arguments for God's will expressed in His creation of all 'visible and invisible' ([[Colossians]] 1:16).
Ray gave an early description of [[dendrochronology]], explaining how to find the [[Ash (tree)|ash tree's]] age from its tree-rings.<ref>Armstrong, 2000. p. 47</ref>

=== Taxonomy ===

Ray's work on [[plant taxonomy]] spanned a wide range of thought, starting with an approach that was predominantly in the tradition of the [[herbalists]] and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]], but becoming increasingly theoretical and finally rejecting Aristotelianism. Despite his early adherence to Aristotelian tradition, his first botanical work, the ''Catalogus plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium'' (1660),{{sfn|Ray|1660}} was almost entirely descriptive, being arranged alphabetically. His model was an account by [[Gaspard Bauhin|Bauhin]] of the plants growing around Basel in 1622 and was the first English county flora, covering about 630 species.{{sfn|Jarvis|2012}} However at the end of the work he appended a brief taxonomy{{sfn|Ray|1660|loc=pp.&nbsp;100–102}} which he stated followed the usage of Bauhin and other herbalists.{{sfn|Ray|1660|loc=pp.&nbsp;100–102}}{{sfn|Slaughter|1982|loc=p.&nbsp;62}}

==== System of classification ====

Ray's system, starting with his Cambridge catalogue, began with the division between the imperfect or lower plants ([[Cryptogams]]), and perfect (''planta perfecta'') higher plants ([[Seed plants]]). The latter he divided by [[life forms]], e.g. trees (''arbores''), shrubs (''frutices''), subshrubs (''suffrutices'') and [[herbaceous plants]] (''herbae'') and lastly grouping them by common characteristics. The trees he divided into 8 groups, e.g. ''Pomiferae'' (including apple and pear). The shrubs he placed in 2 groups, ''Spinosi'' ([[Berberis]] etc.) and ''Non Spinosi'' ([[Jasmine]] etc.). The subshrubs formed a single group and the herbs into 21 groups.{{sfn|Slaughter|1982|loc=pp.&nbsp;62–63}}

==== Definition of species ====
Ray was the first person to produce a biological definition of '''[[species]]''', in his 1686 ''History of Plants'':

{{blockquote|... no ''surer criterion for determining species has occurred to me than'' the distinguishing features that perpetuate themselves in propagation from seed. Thus, no matter what variations occur in the individuals or the species, if they spring from the seed of one and the same plant, they are accidental variations and not such as to distinguish a species... Animals likewise that differ specifically preserve their distinct species permanently; one species never springs from the seed of another nor vice versa.<ref>Mayr ''Growth of biological thought'' p256; original was Ray, ''History of Plants''. 1686, trans E. Silk.</ref>}}

=== Publications ===

Ray published about 23 works, depending on how they are counted. The biological works were usually in Latin, the rest in English.<ref name="Keynes">[[Geoffrey Keynes|Keynes, Sir Geoffrey]] [1951] 1976. ''John Ray, 1627–1705: a bibliography 1660–1970''.

From then on, he used 'Ray', after "having ascertained that such had been the practice of his family before him".{{sfn|Gunther|1928|loc=p.&nbsp;16}}

Ray's biographer, Charles Raven, commented that "Ray sweeps away the litter of mythology and fable... and always insists upon accuracy of observation and description and the testing of every new discovery".{{sfn|Raven|1950}}<sup>p10</sup> Ray's works were directly influential on the development of taxonomy by [[Carl Linnaeus]].

The [[Ray Society]], named after John Ray, was founded in 1844. It is a scientific [[text publication society]] and [[Charitable organization|registered charity]], based at the [[Natural History Museum, London]], which exists to publish books on natural history, with particular (but not exclusive) reference to the flora and fauna of the British Isles. As of 2017, the Society had published 179 volumes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raysociety.org.uk/ |title=The Ray Society |access-date=25 December 2017 }}</ref>

The John Ray Society (a separate organisation) is the Natural Sciences Society at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]]. It organises a programme of events of interest to science students in the college.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.johnray.caths.cam.ac.uk/Home.html | title=John Ray Society | publisher=St Catharine's College, Cambridge | access-date=7 May 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193538/http://www.johnray.caths.cam.ac.uk/Home.html | archive-date=2 January 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1986, to mark the 300th anniversary of the publication of Ray's ''Historia Plantarum'', there was a celebration of Ray's legacy in [[Braintree, Essex]]. A "John Ray Gallery" was opened in the [[Braintree, Essex#Culture|Braintree Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John Ray |url=http://www.braintreemuseum.co.uk/john-ray/ |publisher=Braintree Museum |access-date=1 February 2015}}</ref>

The John Ray Initiative (JRI) is an educational [[charitable organization|charity]] that seeks to reconcile scientific and Christian understandings of the environment. It was formed in 1997 in response to the global environmental crisis and the challenges of sustainable development and environmental stewardship. John Ray's writings proclaimed God as creator whose wisdom is "manifest in the works of creation", and as redeemer of all things. JRI aims to teach appreciation of nature, increase awareness of the state of the global environment, and to promote a Christian understanding of environmental issues.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mission |url=http://www.jri.org.uk/introduction/mission-statement/ |publisher=The John Ray Initiative |access-date=1 February 2015}}</ref>

Furthermore, a nature walk has been established in Essex in memorium of John Ray. This walk was conquered by the Latimer/Hines household on 27 May 2024.
