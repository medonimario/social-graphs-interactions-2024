Sosa received the 2010 [[Nicholas Rescher]] Prize for contributions to systematic philosophy, conferred by the [[University of Pittsburgh]] biennially.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.news.pitt.edu/news/philosopher-ernest-sosa-inaugural-recipient-pitt%E2%80%99s-prestigious-rescher-prize | title= }}</ref> His son, [[David Sosa]], is a professor and chair of the philosophy department at the [[University of Texas, Austin]], and also specializes in epistemology.

== Philosophical work ==

In addition to epistemology, Sosa has also written on [[metaphysics]], [[modern philosophy]] and [[philosophy of mind]]. In his books ''Knowledge in Perspective'' (1991) and ''A Virtue Epistemology'' (2007), he defends a form of [[virtue epistemology]] called "virtue perspectivism", which distinguishes animal knowledge from reflective knowledge.

===Virtue epistemology===

"Contemporary virtue epistemology, conceived as such and as a distinctive movement within epistemology, began with Ernest Sosa’s work in the early 1980s."<ref>{{Cite book | chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-virtue/#PrecContOrig | title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | chapter=Virtue Epistemology | year=2021 | publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University }}</ref>   Virtue epistemology is characterized by two features: against [[W. V. O. Quine]], it views "epistemology as a normative discipline" and "intellectual agents and communities as the primary focus of epistemic evaluation, with a focus on the intellectual virtues and vices embodied in and expressed by these agents and communities."<ref>{{Cite book | chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-virtue/ | title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | chapter=Virtue Epistemology | year=2021 | publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University }}</ref>

=== Metaphysics (composition) ===
'''Absolutism and Its "explosion"'''<br>In "Existential Relativity," Sosa considers theories of composition.<ref name=paper >{{cite book |author1-first=Ernest |author1-last=Sosa |editor1-last=Kim |editor1-first=Jaegwon |editor2-last=Korman |editor2-first=Daniel Z. |editor3-last=Sosa |editor3-first=Ernest |title=Metaphysics: An Anthology |date=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Oxford |pages=652–660 |edition=2nd |chapter=Existential Relativity}}</ref> He calls ordinary theories of composition absolutism, which has objects as existing absolutely when compositional conditions are fulfilled in the object. Objects exist when certain stuff is arranged in a certain way. Absolutism leads to what Sosa coins an "explosion" of entities in that an indeterminate number overlap at a location and any change destroys and creates an indeterminate number of others.

Sosa provides an illustration to motivate this problem. A snowball is made of a piece of snow in a "round" (spherical) shape and follows certain persistence conditions. Sosa introduces the concept of a "snowdiscall." A snowdiscall is "constituted by a piece of snow as matter and as form any shape between round [spherical] and being disc-shaped."<ref name=paper />{{rp|p=652}} On this definition, a snowball is also a snowdiscall, but a snowdiscall is not necessarily a snowball. So there are two distinct objects that overlap. But just as there is a snowdiscall, there can be an indeterminate number of other objects: objects between round and 50% disc-shaped, objects between round and 30% disc-shaped, etc. These are distinct, existing objects and not just arbitrary descriptions. What seems to be arbitrary in absolutism is the idea that one object (the snowball) has more claim to existence than the others.

'''Existential relativism:''' As a potential solution, Sosa advances existential relativism. The central claim is that objects do not exist objectively as if some "[c]onstituted, [[supervenience|supervenient]] entities [. . .] objectively supervene[d] on their requisite constitutive matters and forms."<ref name=paper />{{rp|p=653}} On existential relativism, composition is relative to a conceptual scheme. Conceptual schemes are mental collections of ideas of how the world exists and interacts. They can differ based on language, culture, personal utility, perspective, etc. A person's conceptual scheme helps select the things in the external world that resemble these mental ideas and then confers existence on them.<ref name=paper />{{rp|p=653}} Since conceptual schemes can differ, different persons may recognize different objects. Conceptual schemes are chosen based on how useful they are to the individual in understanding the world.

'''Sosa's working definition of existential relativism:''' "that what exists relative to our present scheme ''O'' is what it recognizes directly, what it recognizes indirectly through its predecessors or successors, and what it ''would'' recognize if we had developed appropriately or were to do so now, and had been or were to be appropriately situated."<ref name=paper />{{rp|p=654}} This definition allows for objects to exist if a conceptual scheme recognizes them, recognizes something that entails another object's existence, or would have recognized them if people had different capacities or spatiotemporal locations.

'''Sosa's anticipated objections:'''<ref name=paper />{{rp|pp=654-658}}

* Objection 1: Would composition occur in a world without persons?
* Objection 2: Aren't "snowdiscalls" simply an arbitrary, superficial classification of an object (e.g. any cat or dog could be a "caog" without ontological problems)?
*Objection 3: Is existential relativism redundant if things exist externally in a certain way and are just recognized by a conceptual scheme? Is existential relativism just absolutism with an emphasis on human perception of the world?
*Objection 4: Is existential relativity a linguistic theory (concerned with how to describe the world as indexed to a person) and not an ontological theory? How are disagreements between opposing conceptual schemes settled?
*Objection 5: Could atoms (or other fundamental particles) exist ''simpliciter'' while other objects (e.g. hammers, cats, snowballs) exist relative to conceptual schemes?
