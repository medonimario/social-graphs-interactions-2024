He founded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, commonly known as [[North Korea]], which he led as [[Supreme Leader (North Korean title)|Supreme Leader]] from [[North Korea#Founding|its establishment]] in 1948 until [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il Sung|his death]] in 1994. Afterwards, he was succeeded by his son [[Kim Jong Il]] and was declared [[Eternal leaders of North Korea|Eternal President]].

He held the posts of the [[Premier of North Korea|Premier]] from 1948 to 1972 and [[President of North Korea|President]] from 1972 to 1994. He was [[General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|the leader]] of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) from 1949 to 1994 (titled as chairman from 1949 to 1966 and as general secretary after 1966). Coming to power after the end of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule over Korea]] in 1945 following Japan's surrender in [[World War II]], he authorized the invasion of [[First Republic of Korea|South Korea]] in 1950, triggering an intervention in defense of South Korea by the United Nations led by the United States. Following the military stalemate in the [[Korean War]], [[Korean Armistice Agreement|a ceasefire was signed in July 1953]]. He was the third-longest serving non-royal head of state/government in the 20th century, in office for more than 45 years.

Under his leadership, North Korea was established as a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[socialist state|socialist]] [[Dictatorship#Personalist|personalist dictatorship]] with a [[Economy of North Korea|centrally planned economy]]. It had very close political and economic relations with the [[Soviet Union]]. By the 1960s, North Korea had a slightly higher [[standard of living]] than the South, which was suffering from political chaos and economic crises. The situation was reversed in the 1970s, as a newly stable South Korea became an economic powerhouse which was fueled by Japanese and American investment, military aid and internal economic development, while North Korea [[Economic stagnation|stagnated]] and then [[Economic collapse|declined]] during the same period.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Duol |title=The great divergence on the Korean peninsula (1910–2020) |journal=Australian Economic History Review |date=November 2021 |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=318–341 |doi=10.1111/aehr.12225 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aehr.12225 |language=en |issn=0004-8992}}</ref> Differences emerged between North Korea and the Soviet Union; chief among them was Kim Il Sung's philosophy of ''[[Juche]]'', which focused on [[Korean nationalism]] and [[Autarky|self-reliance]]. Despite this, the country received funds, subsidies and aid from the USSR and the [[Eastern Bloc]] until the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the USSR]] in 1991.

The resulting loss of economic aid negatively affected North Korea's economy, contributing to [[North Korean famine|widespread famine]] in 1994. During this period, North Korea also remained critical of the [[United States Forces Korea|United States defense force]]'s presence in the region, which it considered [[American imperialism|imperialist]], having seized the American ship {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} in 1968. This was part of an [[Korean DMZ Conflict|infiltration and subversion campaign]] to [[Korean reunification|reunify]] the [[Korean Peninsula|peninsula]] under North Korea's rule. Kim outlived his allies, [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]], by over four and almost two decades, respectively, and remained in power during the terms of office of six [[List of presidents of South Korea|South Korean Presidents]] and ten [[List of Presidents of the United States|United States Presidents]]. Known as the Great Leader (''[[Ideology of the Workers' Party of Korea#Suryong|Suryong]]''), he established [[Kim Il Sung's cult of personality|a far-reaching personality cult]] which dominates [[Politics of North Korea|domestic politics in North Korea]]. At the [[6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea|6th WPK Congress]] in 1980, his oldest son [[Kim Jong Il]] was elected to be a [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Presidium]] member and chosen to be his successor, thus establishing the [[Kim family (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]].

[[China]] acquiesced only reluctantly to the idea of Korean reunification after being told by Kim that Stalin had approved the action.<ref name="weathersby432" /><ref name="goncharov" /><ref name="mansourov94107" /> The Chinese did not provide North Korea with direct military support (other than logistics channels) until United Nations troops, largely US forces, had nearly reached the [[Yalu River]] late in 1950. At the outset of the war in June and July, North Korean forces captured [[Seoul]] and occupied most of the South, save for a small section of territory in the southeast region of the South that was called the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter|Pusan Perimeter]]. But in September, the North Koreans were driven back by the US-led counterattack that started with the UN landing in [[Incheon]], followed by a combined South Korean-US-UN offensive from the Pusan Perimeter. By October, UN forces had retaken Seoul and invaded the North to reunify the country under the South. On 19 October, US and South Korean troops captured P'yŏngyang, forcing Kim and his government to flee north, first to [[Sinuiju]] and eventually into [[Kanggye]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Mossman |first=Billy |date=29 June 2005 |title=United States Army in the Korean War: Ebb and Flow November 1950 – July 1951|publisher=University Press of the Pacific |page=51}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Sandler |first=Stanley |date=1999 |title=The Korean War: No Victors, No Vanquished |url=https://archive.org/details/koreanwarnovicto0000sand |url-access=registration |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |page=[https://archive.org/details/koreanwarnovicto0000sand/page/108 108]}}</ref>

[[File:Kim Il-sung in 1950.jpg|thumb|Kim's official portrait in 1950]]
On 25 October 1950, after sending various warnings of their intent to intervene if UN forces did not halt their advance,<ref name="Halberstam 2007">David Halberstam. Halberstam, David (25 September 2007). The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War. Hyperion. Kindle Edition.</ref>{{rp|23}} Chinese troops in the thousands crossed the Yalu River and entered the war as allies of the KPA. There were nevertheless tensions between Kim and the Chinese government. Kim had been warned of the likelihood of an amphibious landing at Incheon, which was ignored. There was also a sense that the North Koreans had paid little in war compared to the Chinese who had fought for their country for decades against foes with better technology.<ref name="Halberstam 2007" />{{rp|335–336}} The UN troops were forced to withdraw and Chinese troops retook P'yŏngyang in December and Seoul in January 1951. In March, UN forces began a new offensive, retaking Seoul and advanced north once again halting at a point just north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]. After a series of offensives and counter-offensives by both sides, followed by a grueling period of largely static [[trench warfare]] that lasted from the summer of 1951 to July 1953, the front was stabilized along what eventually became the permanent "[[Military Demarcation Line|Armistice Line]]" of 27 July 1953. Over 2.5 million people died during the Korean War.<ref>Bethany Lacina and Nils Petter Gleditsch, [http://www.eui.eu/Documents/DepartmentsCentres/SPS/Seminars/SeminarsF09/PVSEMF08/LacinaGleditschMonitoringTrendsInGlobalCombatEJP2005.pdf Monitoring Trends in Global Combat: A New Dataset of Battle Deaths] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043824/http://www.eui.eu/Documents/DepartmentsCentres/SPS/Seminars/SeminarsF09/PVSEMF08/LacinaGleditschMonitoringTrendsInGlobalCombatEJP2005.pdf |date=12 October 2013}}, European Journal of Population (2005) 21: 145–166.</ref>

Chinese and Russian documents from that time reveal that Kim became increasingly desperate to establish a truce, since the likelihood that further fighting would successfully unify Korea under his rule became more remote with the UN and US presence. Kim also resented the Chinese taking over the majority of the fighting in his country, with Chinese forces stationed at the center of the front line, and the Korean People's Army being mostly restricted to the coastal flanks of the front.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/static/neh/interactives/timeline/data/102550.html|title=25 October 1950|website=teachingamericanhistory.org|access-date=31 March 2019|archive-date=16 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916090341/http://teachingamericanhistory.org/static/neh/interactives/timeline/data/102550.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Consolidation of power ===

With the end of the Korean War, despite the failure to unify Korea under his rule, Kim Il Sung proclaimed the war a victory in the sense that he had remained in power in the north. However, the three-year war left North Korea devastated, and Kim immediately embarked on a large reconstruction effort. He launched a five-year national economic plan (akin to [[Five-year plans of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's five-year plans]]) to establish a [[command economy]], with all industry owned by the state and all agriculture [[Collective farming|collectivized]]. The economy was focused on heavy industry and arms production. By the 1960s, North Korea enjoyed a standard of living which was higher than the standard of living in the South, which was [[First Republic of Korea|fraught with political instability and economic crises]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Making of Modern Korea|last=Buzo|first=Adrian|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-23749-9|location=London|page=140}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History|last=Cumings|first=Bruce|publisher=[[W.

In the ensuing years, Kim established himself as an independent leader of [[World communism|international communism]]. In 1956, he joined Mao in the "[[Anti-revisionism|anti-revisionist]]" camp, which did not accept [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s program of [[de-Stalinization]], yet he did not become a [[Maoism|Maoist]] himself. At the same time, he consolidated his power over the [[Communism in Korea|Korean communist movement]]. Rival leaders were eliminated. [[Pak Hon-yong]], leader of the Korean Communist Party, was purged and executed in 1955. [[Choe Chang-ik]] appears to have been purged as well.<ref>Lankov, Andrei N., ''Crisis in North Korea: The Failure of De-Stalinization, 1956'', Honolulu: Hawaii University Press (2004), {{ISBN|978-0-8248-2809-7}}</ref><ref>Timothy Hildebrandt, [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/asia_rpt115b.pdf "Uneasy Allies: Fifty Years of China-North Korea Relations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224234236/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/asia_rpt115b.pdf |date=24 February 2015}}, ''Asia Program Special Report'', September 2003, Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars.</ref> Yi Sang-Cho, North Korea's ambassador to the Soviet Union and a critic of Kim who defected to the Soviet Union in 1956, was declared a factionalist and a traitor.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lankov |first1=Andrei |last2=Selivanov |first2=Igor |date=22 October 2018 |title=A peculiar case of a runaway ambassador: Yi Sang-Cho's defection and the 1956 crisis in North Korea |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14682745.2018.1507022 |journal=[[Cold War History (journal)|Cold War History]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=233–251 |doi=10.1080/14682745.2018.1507022 |s2cid=158492110 |access-date=18 February 2023}}</ref> The 1955 [[Juche speech|''Juche'' speech]], which stressed Korean independence, debuted in the context of Kim's power struggle against leaders such as Pak, who had Soviet backing.

He also charged Kim with rewriting history so it would appear as if his guerrilla faction had single-handedly liberated Korea from the Japanese, completely ignoring the assistance of the [[Chinese People's Volunteers]]. In addition, Li stated that in the process of agricultural collectivization, grain was being forcibly confiscated from the peasants, leading to "at least 300 suicides" and he also stated that Kim made nearly all major policy decisions and appointments himself. Li reported that over 30,000 people were in prison for completely unjust and arbitrary reasons which were as trivial as not printing Kim Il Sung's portrait on sufficient quality paper or using newspapers with his picture to wrap parcels.

During his rise and his consolidation of power, Kim created the ''[[songbun]]'', a [[caste]] system in which the North Korean people were divided into three groups.

These camps or ''[[Kwalliso|kwanliso]]'', a part of Kim's vast network of abusive [[Prisons in North Korea|penal and forced labor institutions]], were fenced and heavily guarded colonies which were located in mountainous areas of the country, where prisoners were forced to perform back-breaking labor such as logging, mining, and picking crops. Most of the prisoners were incarcerated in these camps for their entire lives, and inside the camps, their living and working conditions were usually deadly. For example, prisoners were nearly starved to death, they were denied medical care, they were denied proper housing and clothes, they were subjected to sexual violence, they were regularly mistreated, and they were [[torture]]d and executed by guards.<ref name="Kim-IlSungLegacy" />

Despite his opposition to de-Stalinization, Kim never officially severed relations with the Soviet Union, and he did not take part in the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. After Khrushchev was replaced by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1964, Kim's relations with the Soviet Union became closer. At the same time, Kim was increasingly alienated by Mao's unstable style of leadership, especially during the [[Cultural Revolution]] in the late 1960s.

The North Korean government's practice of abducting foreign nationals, such as [[Demographics of South Korea|South Koreans]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Thai people|Thais]], and [[Romanians]], is another practice of Kim Il Sung which persists to the present day.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}} Kim Il Sung planned these operations to seize persons who could be used to support North Korea's overseas intelligence operations, or those who had technical skills to maintain the socialist state's economic infrastructure in farms, construction, hospitals, and heavy industry. According to the Korean War Abductees Family Union (KWAFU), those abducted by North Korea after the war included 2,919 civil servants, 1,613 police, 190 judicial officers and lawyers, and 424 medical practitioners. In the [[Korean Air Lines YS-11 hijacking|hijacking and seizure of Korean Airlines flight YS-11 in 1969]] by North Korean agents, the pilots and mechanics, and others with specialized skills, were the only ones never permitted to return to South Korea. The total number of foreign abductees and disappeared is still unknown but is estimated to include more than 200,000 people. The vast majority of disappearances occurred or were linked to the Korean War, but hundreds of South Koreans and Japanese people were abducted between the 1960s and 1980s. A number of South Koreans and nationals of the People's Republic of China have also been apparently abducted in the 2000s and 2010s.

The [[Constitution of North Korea]] was proclaimed on December 27, 1972, which created the position of the [[President of North Korea]].

At the [[6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea|Sixth Party Congress]] in October 1980, Kim publicly designated his son as his successor. In 1986, a rumor spread that Kim had been assassinated, making the concern for Jong-il's ability to succeed his father actual. Kim dispelled the rumors, however, by making a series of public appearances.

The [[Revolutions of 1989]] in [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], from 1989 to 1992, completed North Korea's virtual isolation. These events led to mounting economic difficulties because Kim refused to issue any economic or political reforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/37-8-310.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310010727/http://osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/37-8-310.shtml|url-status=dead|title=North Korea's Trade With the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe|publisher=Open Society Archives|archive-date=10 March 2016}}</ref>

As he aged, starting in the 1970s, Kim developed a [[calcinosis]]{{citation needed|date=October 2024}} growth on the right side of the back of his neck. It was long believed that its close proximity to his brain and spinal cord made it inoperable. However, Juan Reinaldo Sánchez, a defected bodyguard for [[Fidel Castro]] who met Kim in 1986 wrote later that it was Kim's own paranoia that prevented it from being operated on.<ref>Juan Reinaldo Sanchez, ''The Double Life of Fidel Castro: My 17 Years as Personal Bodyguard to El Lider Maximo'', [[Penguin Press]] (2014) p. 234.</ref> Because of its unappealing nature, North Korean reporters and photographers were required to photograph Kim while standing slightly to his left in order to hide the growth from official photographs and newsreels.

To ensure a full succession of leadership to his son and designated successor Kim Jong Il, Kim turned over his chairmanship of North Korea's [[National Defence Commission|National Defense Commission]]{{snd}}the body mainly responsible for control of the armed forces as well as the supreme commandership of the country's now million-man strong military force, the Korean People's Army{{snd}}to his son in 1991 and 1993. So far, the elder Kim{{snd}}even though he is dead{{snd}}has remained the country's president and the chairman of the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|Party's Central Military Commission]], the party's organization that has supreme supervision and authority over military matters.
In early 1994, Kim began investing in nuclear power to offset energy shortages brought on by economic problems. This was the [[1994 North Korean nuclear crisis|first of many "nuclear crises"]]. On 19 May 1994, Kim ordered spent fuel to be unloaded from the already disputed nuclear research facility in [[Yongbyon nuclear facility|Yongbyon]]. Despite repeated chiding from Western nations, Kim continued to conduct [[North Korean nuclear program|nuclear research]] and carry on with the uranium enrichment program. In June 1994, former [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] traveled to Pyongyang in an effort to persuade Kim to negotiate with the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] over its nuclear program.<ref>{{cite web| last=Blakemore| first=Erin| title=Bill Clinton Once Struck a Nuclear Deal With North Korea| website=history.com| url=https://www.history.com/news/north-korea-nuclear-deal-bill-clinton-agreed-framework| date=1 September 2018| publisher=A&E Television Networks| access-date=3 July 2019| archive-date=27 June 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627022148/http://www.history.com/news/north-korea-nuclear-deal-bill-clinton-agreed-framework| url-status=live}}</ref> To the astonishment of the United States and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], Kim agreed to halt his nuclear research program and seemed to be embarking upon a new opening to the West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422115356/http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron|url-status=dead|title=Chronology of U.S.-North Korean Nuclear and Missile Diplomacy|publisher=Arms Control Association|archive-date=22 April 2012}}</ref>

Shortly before [[noon]] on 7 July 1994, Kim Il Sung collapsed from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at his residence in [[Hyangsan County|Hyangsan]], [[North Pyongan Province|North Pyongan]]. After the heart attack, Kim Jong Il ordered the team of doctors who were constantly at his father's side to leave and arranged for the country's best doctors to be flown in from Pyongyang. After several hours, the doctors from Pyongyang arrived, but despite their efforts to save him, Kim Il Sung died at 02:00 am [[Pyongyang Standard Time|PST]] on 8 July 1994, aged 82.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Reid |first=T.

His funeral was scheduled to be held on 17 July 1994 in Pyongyang but was delayed until 19 July.<ref>{{cite news |title=North Korea postpones Kim's funeral |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/assets/images/ST175/NewspaperSG/1994-07-17/full.jpg |work=The Straits Times |date=17 July 1994 |access-date=14 March 2022 |archive-date=14 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221014020444/https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/assets/images/ST175/NewspaperSG/1994-07-17/full.jpg |url-status=live}}</ref> It was attended by hundreds of thousands of people who were flown into the city from all over North Korea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024|reason=No reference in the adorning sources to the claim that people were "flown in", which insinuates they were artificially brought to the funeral.}} Kim Il Sung's body was placed in a public [[mausoleum]] at the [[Kumsusan Palace of the Sun]], where his preserved and embalmed body lies under a glass coffin for viewing purposes.

== Contributions to political theory ==
{{Main|Juche}}
Kim Il Sung's most notable contribution to political theory is his conceptualization of the ''Juche'' idea, originally described as a variant of [[Marxism–Leninism]].

In his writings, Kim engaged with Karl Marx's metaphor that religion is the [[opium of the people]]. He did so both in the context of responding to his comrades who objected to working with religious groups (Chonbulygo and [[Cheondoism|Chondoism]], respectively).<ref name=":5">{{Cite book |last=Boer |first=Roland |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1078879745 |title=Red theology : on the Christian Communist tradition |date=2019 |publisher=[[Haymarket Books]] |isbn=978-90-04-38132-2 |location=Boston |pages=221 |oclc=1078879745}}</ref> In the first instance, Kim replies that a person is "mistaken" if he or she believes Marx's proposition regarding "opium of the people" can be applied in all instances, explaining that if a religion "prays for dealing out divine punishment to Japan and blessing the Korean nation" then it is a "patriotic religion" and its believers are patriots.<ref name=":5" /> In the second, Kim states that Marx's metaphor "must not be construed radically and unilaterally" because Marx was warning against "the temptation of a religious mirage and not opposing believers in general."<ref name=":5" /> Because the communist movement in Korea was fighting a struggle for "national salvation" against Japan, Kim writes that anyone with a similar agenda can join the struggle and that "even a religionist ... must be enrolled in our ranks without hesitation."<ref name=":5" />

== Personal life ==
{{see also|Kim family (North Korea)}}
[[File:Kim Jong-suk and Kim Jong-il.jpg|thumb|upright|Kim's first wife, [[Kim Jong Suk]], and their son, [[Kim Jong Il]]]]

Kim Il Sung married twice. His first wife, Kim Jong Suk (1917–1949),<ref name="Lee 2023" /> gave birth to two sons and one daughter before her death in childbirth during the delivery of a stillborn girl. Kim Jong Il was his oldest son.<ref name="Lee 2023" /> The other son ([[Kim Man-il]],<ref name="Lee 2023" /> or Shaura Kim) of this marriage died in 1947<ref name="Lee 2023" /> in a swimming accident.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}} A daughter, [[Kim Kyong-hui]], was born in 1946.<ref name="Lee 2023" />

Kim married [[Kim Song-ae]] (1924–2014) in 1952, and had four children with her: Kim Kyong Suk (1951–), Kim Kyong Jin (1952–), [[Kim Pyong Il]] (1954–), Kim Yong Il (1955–2000; not to be confused with the [[Kim Yong-il|former Premier of North Korea]] with the same name).<ref name="Lee 2023" /> Kim Pyong-il was prominent in Korean politics until he became ambassador to [[Hungary]]. In 2015, Kim Pyong Il became the ambassador to the [[Czech Republic]]; he officially retired in 2019 and returned to North Korea.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}
