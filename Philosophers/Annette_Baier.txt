She was well known also for her contributions to [[feminist philosophy]] and to the philosophy of mind, where she was strongly influenced by her former colleague, [[Wilfrid Sellars]].

==Biography==
Baier earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the [[University of Otago]] in her native [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]]. In 1952 she went to [[Somerville College, Oxford]], where she earned her PhD and met fellow philosophers [[Philippa Foot]] and [[G.E.M. Anscombe]]. For most of her career she taught in the philosophy department at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], having moved there from [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. She retired to Dunedin.

She was former President of the Eastern Division of the [[American Philosophical Association]], an office reserved for the elite of her profession. Baier received an honorary Doctor of Literature from the University of Otago in 1999.

Her husband was the philosopher [[Kurt Baier]].

==Ethics==
Baier's approach to ethics is that women and men make their decisions about right and wrong based on different value systems: men take their moral decisions according to an idea of [[justice]], while women are motivated by a sense of [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] or [[ethics of care|caring]]. The history of philosophy having been overwhelmingly compiled by men, she suggests, leads to a body of thought which apparently ignores the role of nurture and trust in human philosophy.<ref>[http://www.open2.net/historyandthearts/philosophy_ethics/baier.html Annette Baier (1929 -)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927053828/http://www.open2.net/historyandthearts/philosophy_ethics/baier.html |date=27 September 2011 }} from [http://www.open2.net Open2.net] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927053828/http://www.open2.net/historyandthearts/philosophy_ethics/baier.html |date=27 September 2011 }}</ref>
