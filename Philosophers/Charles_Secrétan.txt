'''Charles Secretan''' (January 19, 1815 – January 21, 1895) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] philosopher. He was born on 19 January 1815 in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, where he also died on 21 January 1895.

Educated in his native town and later under [[Friedrich Schelling]] in [[Munich]], he became a professor of philosophy at Lausanne (1838 to 1846), and later at [[Neuchâtel]].  In 1866 he returned to his old position at Lausanne.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1837 he founded, and for a time edited the ''Revue Suisse''. The object of his writing was to build up a rational, philosophical religion to reconcile the ultimate bases of Christianity with the principles of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical philosophy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
