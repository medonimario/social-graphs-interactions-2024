He was educated in [[Tanta]] at a private school.<ref name=EB/> When he turned thirteen, he was sent to the Aḥmadī mosque, which was one of the largest educational institutions in Egypt. A while later, ʿAbduh ran away from school and got married. After a brief period following his marriage, ʿAbduh returned to his school in Tanta. During this period, ʿAbduh studied under the tutelage of his [[Sufism|Sufi Muslim]] uncle Dārwīsh, who was a member of the revivalist and reformist ''Madaniyya'' ''[[Tariqa|Tarîqâh]]'', a popular branch of the ''[[Shadhili]]yya'' order, spread across Egypt, [[Ottoman Libya|Libya]], [[Ottoman Algeria|Algeria]], and [[Ottoman Tunisia|Tunisia]]. Apart from spiritual exercises, the order also emphasised proper practice of [[Islam]], shunning ''[[taqlid]]'' and stressing adherence to foundational teachings. Under the tutelage of his uncle, ʿAbduh began to practice the litany of the ''Madaniyya''. Like many of his fellow students in Tanta, the experience would transform ʿAbduh towards Sufi asceticism with mystical orientations. Abduh would inherit many of his subsequent public views, such as firm opposition to ''taqlid'' from his Sufi uncle.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sedgwick|first=Mark|title=Makers of the Muslim World: Muhammad Abduh|publisher=One World Publications|year=2013|isbn=978-1851684328|pages=3–4, 13|chapter=Chapter 1: The Student}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hourani|first=Albert|url=https://archive.org/details/arabicthoughtinl0000hour|title=Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1962|location=Great Britain|url-access=registration}}</ref>

[[File:Muhammad Abduh.jpg|thumb|right|An early photo of Muḥammad ʿAbduh]]
ʿAbduh suffered from acute spiritual crises in his youth, similar to those experienced by the medieval [[Ulama|Muslim scholar]] and Sufi mystic [[al-Ghazali]]. He was heavily dissatisfied with the traditional education and representatives of mainstream ''ulama'' of his time. Under the influence of Shaykh Dārwīsh al-Khadīr, ''[[Sufism|Tasawwuf]]'' provided an alternative form of religiosity which would profoundly shape ʿAbduh's spiritual and intellectual formation. As ʿAbduh would subsequently emerge as a towering scholarly intellectual in Egypt, he concurrently assumed his role as a traditional Sufi Muslim. ''Tasawwuf'' as taught to ʿAbduh by Shaykh Dārwīsh transcended the perceived limitations and superficialities of traditional Islamic learning, and was based on an Islamic religiosity led by an intellectual, charismatic authority. For ʿAbduh, Shaykh Dārwīsh and his teachings represented orthodox Sufism, which was different from the Sufi folklore and the charlatans prevalent in rural Egypt during the [[Early modern period|early modern era]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scharbrodt|first=Oliver|date=2007|title=The Salafiyya and Sufism: Muhammad 'Abduh and his Risalat al-Waridat (Treatise on Mystical Inspirations)|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40378895|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=70|issue=1|page=92|doi=10.1017/S0041977X07000031|jstor=40378895|s2cid=170641656}}</ref> Explaining his conversion to Sufism under the training of Shaykh Dārwīsh, 'Abduh wrote: <blockquote>"On the seventh day, I asked the shaykh: ''What is your ''[[Tariqa|tarîqâh]]''?'' He replied: ''Islam is my ''tarıqa''.'' I asked: ''But are not all these people Muslims?'' He said: ''If they were Muslims, you would not see them contending over trivial matters and would not hear them swearing by God while they are lying with or without a reason.''

During his studies in al-Azhar, ʿAbduh had continued to express his critiques of the traditional curricuulum and traditional modes of repetition. For him, al-Afghānī combined personal charisma with a fresh intellectual approach which the ''ulama'' of al-Azhar couldn't provide. As a young 22 year-old Sufi mystic seeking a charismatic guide and alternative modes of learning and religiosity, ʿAbduh chose al-Afghānī as his ''[[murshid]]''. Their ''[[murid]]''–''murshid'' relationship would last for eight years and al-Afghānī was able to meet the expectations of his young disciple. Under al-Afghani's influence, ʿAbduh combined journalism, politics, and his own fascination with Islamic mystical spirituality. Al-Afghānī enriched ʿAbduh's mysticism with a philosophical underpinning and thereby drew him to a rationalist interpretations of Islam. Al-Afghānī's lessons merged his Sufi mysticism with the esoteric and theosophic tradition of [[Qajar Persia|Persian]] [[Shia Islam|Shīʿīsm]]. He also taught ʿAbduh about the problems of Egypt and the [[Islamic world]], and about the technological achievements of the [[Western world|Western civilization]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scharbrodt|first=Oliver|date=2007|title=The Salafiyya and Sufsm: Muhammad 'Abduh and his Risalat al-Waridat (Treatise on Mystical Inspirations)|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40378895|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=70|issue=1|pages=93–94|doi=10.1017/S0041977X07000031|jstor=40378895|s2cid=170641656}}</ref>

In 1877, ʿAbduh was granted the degree of ''[[Ulama|ʿālim]]'' ("teacher") and he started to teach logic, Islamic theology, and [[Islamic ethics|ethics]] at al-Azhar University. In 1878, he was appointed [[professor]] of [[history]] at Cairo's teachers' training college ''[[Dar al-Ulum|Dar al-ʿUlūm]]'', later incorporated into [[Cairo University]]. He was also appointed to teach [[Arabic]] at the Khedivial School of Languages.<ref name=KG/> He is regarded as one of the key founding figures of [[Islamic Modernism]], sometimes called "Neo-[[Muʿtazila|Muʿtazilism]]" after the homonymous [[Schools of Islamic theology|medieval school of Islamic theology]] based on [[rationalism]].<ref>Ahmed H. Al-Rahim (January 2006). "Islam and Liberty", ''Journal of Democracy'' 17 (1), pp. 166-169.</ref> ʿAbduh was also appointed editor-in-chief of ''[[Al-Waqa'i' al-Misriyya|al-Waqāʾiʿ al-Miṣriyya]]'', the [[official newspaper]] of Egypt. He was dedicated to reforming all aspects of Egyptian society and believed that education was the best way to achieve this goal. He was in favor of a good religious education, which would strengthen a child's morals, and a scientific education, which would nurture a child's ability to reason. In his articles he criticized corruption, superstition, and the luxurious lives of the rich.<ref name=KG/>

In 1879, due to his [[political activism]], al-Afghānī was exiled and ʿAbduh was exiled to his home village. The following year he was granted control of the national gazette and used this as a means to spread his [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonial ideas]], and the need for social and religious reforms.<ref name=EB/> He was exiled from Egypt by the [[British Empire|British forces]] in 1882 for six years, for supporting the Egyptian nationalist [[ʻUrabi revolt]] led by [[Ahmed ʻUrabi]] in 1879. He had stated that every society should be allowed to choose a suitable form of government based on its history and its present circumstances.<ref name=KG/> ʿAbduh spent several years in [[Ottoman Lebanon]], where he helped establish an Islamic educational system. In 1884 he moved to [[Paris]] in [[France]], where he joined al-Afghānī in publishing ''[[Al-Urwah al-Wuthqa|al-ʿUrwa al-Wuthqā]]'', an Islamic revolutionary journal that promoted [[Anti-British sentiment|anti-British views]]. ʿAbduh also visited Britain and discussed the state of Egypt and [[Ottoman Sudan|Sudan]] with high-ranking officials. In 1885, after brief stays in [[England]] and Tunisia, he returned to [[Beirut]] as a teacher,<ref name=EB/> and was surrounded by scholars from different religious backgrounds. During his stay, he dedicated his efforts toward furthering respect and friendship between [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], and [[Judaism]].<ref name=KG/>

[[File:Comite khaldounia.jpg|thumb|right|265px|Muḥammad ʿAbduh's meeting with members of the executive committee of [[Tunisia]]n educational institute [[Khaldounia]] in 1903]]
When he returned to Egypt in 1888, ʿAbduh began his legal career. He was appointed [[Qadi|judge]] (''qāḍī'') in the Courts of First Instance of the Native Tribunals and in 1891, he became a consultative member of the Court of Appeal.<ref name=EB/> In 1899, he was appointed [[Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah|Grand Mufti of Egypt]], the highest Islamic title, and he held this position until he died. As a ''qāḍī'', he was involved in many decisions, some of which were considered liberal, such as the ability to utilize meat butchered by [[Kafir|Non-Muslims]] and the acceptance of loan interest. His liberal views endeared him to the British, in particular [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]]; however they also caused a rift between him and the khedive [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas Hilmi]] and the nationalist leader [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha]].<ref name=EB/> While he was in Egypt, ʿAbduh founded a religious society, became president of a society for the revival of Arab sciences, and worked towards reforming the educational system of al-Azhar University by putting forth proposals to improve examinations, the curriculum, and the working conditions for both professors and students.<ref name=KG/> In 1900, he founded The Society for the Revival of Arabic Literature.<ref name=Brockett>Brockett, Adrian Alan, ''[https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/2770 Studies in two transmissions of the Qur'an]'', p. 11.</ref>

He travelled a great deal and met with European scholars in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. He studied the [[Napoleonic law|French law]] and read many great European and Arabic literary works in the libraries of [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]]. The conclusions he drew from his travels were that [[Muslims]] suffer from ignorance about their own religion and the despotism of unjust rulers.<ref name="KG" /> ʿAbduh died due to [[renal cell carcinoma]] in [[Alexandria]] on 11 July 1905.

Muḥammad ʿAbduh argued that Muslims could not simply rely on the interpretations of texts provided by medieval clerics; they needed to use reason to keep up with changing times. He said that in Islam, man was not created to be led by a bridle, but that man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to ʿAbduh, a teacher's role was to direct men towards study. He believed that Islam encouraged men to detach from the world of their ancestors and that Islam reproved the slavish imitation of tradition. He said that the two greatest possessions relating to religion that man was graced with were independence of will and independence of thought and opinion. It was with the help of these tools that he could attain happiness. He believed that the growth of western civilization in Europe was based on these two principles. He thought that Europeans were roused to act after a large number of them were able to exercise their choice and to seek out facts with their minds.<ref>Gelvin, J. L. (2008). The Modern Middle East (2nd ed., pp. 161-162). New York: Oxford university Press.</ref> His Muslim opponents [[Takfir|accused him]] to be an [[Kafir|infidel]], whereas his students and followers regarded him as a sage, a reviver of Islam, and a reforming leader. He is conventionally graced with the honorary epithets ''al-Ustādh al-Imām'' and ''al-Shaykh al-Muftī''. In his works, he portrays God as educating humanity from its childhood through its youth and then on to adulthood. According to him, Islam is the only religion whose dogmas can be proven by reasoning. ʿAbduh didn't advocate for returning to the early stages of Islam. He was against [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] if it resulted in injustice between wives, and believed in a form of Islam that would liberate men from enslavement and abolish the ''ulama'' monopoly on the [[Tafsir|exegesis of the Quran]] and abolish [[racial discrimination]].<ref name=KG/> He described a fundamental re-interpretation of Islam as a genuine base of empowered Arab societies in the face of secular Western imperialism, and believed Islam to be the solution to political and social problems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-ir.info/2014/09/12/islamic-state-the-arab-spring-and-the-disenchantment-with-political-islam/|title = Islamic State, the Arab Spring, and the Disenchantment with Political Islam|date = 12 September 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Imam Muḥammad 'Abduh.jpg|thumb|right|Muḥammad ʿAbduh during his last days]]
ʿAbduh regularly called for better [[Interfaith dialogue|friendship between religious communities]]. He made great efforts to preach harmony between [[Sunni Islam|Sunnī]] and [[Shia Islam|Shīʿa]] Muslims. Broadly speaking, he preached brotherhood between all [[Islamic schools and branches|schools of thought within Islam]]. However, he criticized what he perceived as errors such as [[superstition]]s coming from popular [[Sufism]].<ref name=Benzine>Benzine, Rachid. Les nouveaux penseurs de l'islam, p. 43-44.</ref> His critiques to the popular cult of [[Wali|Muslim saints]], customs of ''[[tabarruk]]'' (seeking blessings) from relics, shrine venerations, etc. were central themes in ʿAbduh's works. He believed that practices such as supplicating and seeking intercession by placing intermediaries between God and human beings were all acts of "manifest ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''" (polytheism) and ''[[bidʻah]]'' (heretical innovations) unknown to the ''[[Salaf]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Linhoff|first=Josef|url=https://hdl.handle.net/1842/36935|title='Associating with God in Islamic Thought': A Comparative Study of Muslim interpretations of shirk|publisher=University of Edinburgh|year=2020|location=Edinburgh, United Kingdom|pages=160|doi=10.7488/era/236|hdl=1842/36935}}</ref> According to ʿAbduh:
{{blockquote|Shirk is of various types including that which has come to affect the Muslim masses ('''āmat al-muslimīn'') in their worship of other than God by way of bowing and prostration. And the greatest of these kinds of shirk is that by way of supplicating and seeking intercession (with God) by placing intermediaries between themselves and Him... And we certainly see this shirk among Muslims today. And you will not see any god added to this religion... except that (expressed by) the word "intercession" (''shafā'a''), which its practitioners reckon is a means of veneration the prophets and saints, but which is, in reality, a means of turning its them into idols, that disgrace the greatness of the Lord of the Worlds. The only explanation for this is in the whispers of Satan.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Linhoff|first=Josef|url=https://hdl.handle.net/1842/36935|title='Associating with God in Islamic Thought': A Comparative Study of Muslim interpretations of shirk|publisher=University of Edinburgh|year=2020|location=Edinburgh, United Kingdom|page=160|chapter=V: Shirk, reason and colonial modernity: Muḥammad 'Abduh (d. 1905)|doi=10.7488/era/236|hdl=1842/36935}}</ref>}}

Despite his strong condemnation of excessive saint veneration, ʿAbduh was sympathetic to ''[[Sufism|Tasawwuf]]'' and [[Al-Ghazali|Ghazzalian]] cosmology. He would explain the philosophical and esoteric Sufi traditions of Islam in his treatise ''Risālat al-Wāridāt fī Sirr al-Tajalliyyat'' ("Treatise on Mystical Inspirations from the Secrets of Revelations") which articulated the philosophical and mystical teachings of his master, [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani|Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī]], incorporating the spiritual ideas of medieval Sufi saints and philosophers such as [[Ibn Arabi]] and [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]]. The language ʿAbduh employs to describe al-Afghānī's instructions was based on a distinctly Sufi framework that symbolised [[Ishraqi|Ishrāqi philosophy]]. The treatise dealt with substantiating the philosophical proofs of [[Existence of God|God's existence]] and his nature, elaborating a [[Sufi cosmology]] and developed a rationalistic understanding of [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|prophecy]]. ʿAbduh adhered to the cosmological doctrine of ''[[Wahdat ul-wujud|Wahdat ul-Wujud]]'' developed by [[Islamic mysticism|mystical]] [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], which held that God and his creation are co-existent and co-eternal.<ref name="Scharbrodt 2007 89–115"/> Defending the doctrine of ''Wahdat ul-Wujud'' of the Sufi philosophers and saints Ibn Arabi, [[Abu al-Najib Suhrawardi|Suhrawardi]], etc., ʿAbduh wrote:{{blockquote|... we believe: there is no existence apart from His existence and no attribute (''wasf'') apart from His attribute. He is existent and anything else is non-existent. The first commanders of the faithful (''al-umarā' al-awwalun''), may God be pleased with them, Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali said: ''You do not perceive anything without seeing God before it, behind it, in it or with it''. ... Do not fall into the delusion that this is the belief in incarnationism (''hulul''). Incarnationism rather occurs between two beings when one of the two becomes the other.

As [[Christianity in Egypt|Christianity was the second largest religion in Egypt]], ʿAbduh would devote special efforts towards friendship between Muslims and Christians. He had many Christian friends and many times he stood up to defend [[Copts]],<ref name="Benzine" /> especially during the Egyptian nationalist [[ʻUrabi revolt]] led by [[Ahmed ʻUrabi]] in 1879, when some Muslim mobs had misguidedly attacked a number of Copts resulting from their anger towards European colonialism.<ref name="Benzine" /> ʿAbduh also had meetings in [[Baghdad]] with [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]],<ref name="Brill 2016"/> son of the founder and spiritual leader of the [[Baháʼí Faith]],<ref name="Iranica">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Bausani |first1=Alessandro |author1-link=Alessandro Bausani |last2=MacEoin |first2=Denis |author2-link=Denis MacEoin |title=ʿAbd-al-Bahā |url=https://iranicaonline.org/articles/abd-al-baha |volume=I/1 |pages=102–104 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |date=14 July 2011 |orig-year=15 December 1982 |issn=2330-4804 |access-date=25 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116231933/https://iranicaonline.org/articles/abd-al-baha |archive-date=16 November 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> whom he had a generally positive view of—although it was asserted by his students that he was unaware of the [[Baháʼí literature|extra-Quranic Baháʼí sacred scriptures]] or status of [[Baháʼu'lláh]] as a [[Manifestation of God (Baháʼí Faith)|Manifestation of God in the Baháʼí Faith]], and mistakenly viewed it as a reformation of [[Shia Islam|Shīʿīsm]].<ref>Juan R.I.

Recognizing its potential political platform, [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani|al-Afghānī]] joined the Freemasons and also encouraged his disciples to join it, including ʿAbduh.<ref name="Kudsi-Zadeh 1972"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Fahmy |first=Ziad |year=2011 |title=Ordinary Egyptians Creating the Modern Nation Through Popular Culture |location=[[Stanford, California]] |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |pages=47–48 |isbn=978-0-8047-7211-2}}</ref>

At the age of 28, ʿAbduh became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and joined a [[Masonic lodge]], the Kawkab Al-Sharq ("Planet of the East"). Its members included [[Tewfik Pasha|Prince Tawfiq]], the Khedive's son and heir, leading personalities such as [[Mohamed Sherif Pasha|Muhammad Sharif Pasha]], who had been a minister, Sulayman Abaza Pasha, and [[Saad Zaghloul|Saad Zaghlul]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/341054 |title=What did Muhammad Abduh do? |date=31 March 2010 |publisher=Arab News |access-date=14 August 2017}}</ref> A.

"Freemasonry in Egypt: Is it still around?" ''Insight Magazine'', 1 March 1999.</ref>

Over the years, ʿAbduh obtained membership in several other [[Masonic lodge]]s based in [[Cairo]] and [[Beirut]].<ref name="Brill 2016"/> In line with [[Freemasonry#Joining a lodge|Masonic principles]], ʿAbduh sought to encourage unity with all religious traditions. He stated:

{{Blockquote|text="I hope to see the two great religions, [[Christianity and Islam|Islam and Christianity]] hand-in-hand, embracing each other. Then the [[Torah]] and the [[Bible]] and the Qur'an will become books supporting one another being read everywhere, and respected by every nation.}}
He added that he was "looking forward to seeing Muslims read the Torah and the Bible."<ref>Muhammad ʿAbduh, "Islam and Christianity", in ''Waqf Ikhlas, The Religion Reformers in Islam'', [[Istanbul]], 1995, page 117.</ref>

=== Withdrawal from Freemasonry ===
ʿAbduh was asked by his associate [[Rashid Rida]], a vehement [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Mason]], regarding the reason for him and his teacher [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani|Jamal al-Din al-Afghānī]] joining Freemasonry.
