Ibn 'Arabi is known for being the first person to explicitly delineate the concept of "''[[Wahdat ul-wujud|Wahdat ul-Wujud]]''" ("Unity of Being"), a [[Monism|monist]] doctrine which claimed that all things in the universe are manifestations of a singular "reality". Ibn 'Arabi equated this "reality" with the entity he described as "the Absolute Being" ("''al-wujud al-mutlaq''").

==Early life==
Ibn ʿArabī was born in [[Murcia]], [[Al-Andalus]] on the 17th of [[Ramadan|Ramaḍān]] 560 AH (28 July 1165 AD),<ref name=":1">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ibn Arabi |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |location=Stanford |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/ibn-arabi/ |access-date=19 July 2018 |last=Chittick |first=William |date=Summer 2018 |author-link=William Chittick |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-link=Edward N.

===Family===
Ibn ʿArabī was of [[Arabs|Arab]] descent.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBlfEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA105 |title=Illustrated Dictionary of the Muslim World |date=2011-01-15 |publisher=Cavendish Square Publishing, LLC |isbn=978-0-7614-9966-4 |pages=105 |language=en}}</ref> Some sources suggest that he came from a mixed background, whose father was an Arab descended from emigrants to Al-Andalus in the early years of the [[Muslim conquest of Spain|Arab conquest of Iberia]], while his mother was presumably of [[Berbers|Berber]] descent.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hirtenstein |first=Stephen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBjyBc_0zjMC&pg=PA32 |title=The Unlimited Mercifier: The Spiritual Life and Thought of Ibn 'Arabi |date=1999 |publisher=Anqa Publishing |isbn=978-1883991296 |location=Oxford |page=32 |quote=Like many Andalusians, he came of mixed parentage: his father's name indicates an Arab family, which had probably emigrated to Andalusia in the early years of the Arab conquest, while his mother seems to have come from a Berber family...}}</ref> In his ''Futūḥāt al-Makkīyah,'' he writes of a deceased maternal uncle, a prince of [[Tlemcen]] who abandoned wealth for an ascetic life after encountering a Sufi mystic.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hirtenstein |first=Stephen C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KplVDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA252 |title=The Unlimited Mercifier: The Spiritual Life and Thought of Ibn 'Arabi |date=September 1999 |isbn=978-1905937387 |page=252|publisher=Anqa }}</ref> His paternal ancestry came from Yemen and belongs to one of the oldest Arab strains in [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]], they having probably migrated during the second wave of the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref name=":2" />

His father, ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad, served in the Army of [[Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn Saʿd ibn Mardanīsh|Ibn Mardanīsh]], the ruler of Murcia.<ref name=":1" /> When Murcia fell to the [[Almohad Caliphate]] in 1172, Ibn Mardanīsh  did not survive the defeat and was killed in battle, leading to his father pledging allegiance to the Almohad Caliph [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf|Abū Ya’qūb Yūsuf I]].<ref name=":2" /> At that time Ibn ʿArabī was only 7 years old, and his family relocated from Murcia to Seville to serve the new ruler.<ref name=":2" />

Ibn ʿArabī had three wives. He married Maryam, a woman from an influential family,<ref name=":1" /> when he was still a young adult and lived in Andalusia. Maryam also shared his aspiration to follow the Sufi path, as quoted by Austin in ''Sufis of Andalusia'': <blockquote>"My saintly wife, Maryam bint Muhammad binti Abdun, said, ‘I have seen in my sleep someone whom I have never seen in the flesh, but who appears to me in my moments of (spiritual) ecstasy. He ask me whether I was aspiring to the Way, to which I replied that I was, but that I did not know by what means to arrive at it. He then told me that I would come to it through five things: trust, certainty, patience, resolution and veracity.’ Thus she offered her vision to me (for my consideration) and I told her that was indeed the method of the Folk (Sufis). I myself have never seen one with that degree of mystical experience."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Austin |first=R.J.W. |title=Sufis of Andalusia: The Ruh Al-Quds & Al-Durrat Al-Fakhirah |publisher=New Leaf Distributing Company |year=1988 |isbn=9780904975130}}</ref></blockquote> When Ibn ʿArabī stayed in Anatolia for several years, according to various Arabic and Persian sources, he married the widow of Majduuddin and took charge of the education of his young son, [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi|Sadruddin al-Qunawi]].<ref name=":2" /> Ibn ʿArabī also mentioned his third wife in his writings, the mother of his son Imāduddin, to whom he bequeathed the first copy of ''Futūḥāt al-Makkīyah''.<ref name=":2" />

===The First Vision===
[[File:Plaza Virgen de los Reyes, Seville, Spain - Sep 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Seville]], where Ibn Arabi spent most of his life and education]]
Ibn ʿArabī grew up at the ruling court and received military training.<ref name=":1" /> As he confessed in ''[[al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya]]'', he preferred playing in military camp with his friends rather than reading a book. However, it was when he was a teenager that he experienced his first vision (''fanā''); and later he wrote of this experience as "the differentiation of the universal reality comprised by that look".<ref name="Chittick 2007, p. 5">Chittick 2007, p. 5.</ref> 

His father, on noticing a change in him, had mentioned this to philosopher and judge, Ibn Rushd ([[Averroes]]),<ref name="Chittick 2007, p. 5" /> who asked to meet Ibn Arabi. Ibn Arabi said that from this first meeting, he had learned to perceive a distinction between formal knowledge of rational thought and the unveiling insights into the nature of things. He then adopted Sufism and dedicated his life to the spiritual path.<ref name="Chittick 2007, p. 5" /> When he later moved to [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], in Morocco, [[Mohammed ibn Qasim al-Tamimi]] became his spiritual mentor.<ref name="Renard2009">{{cite book |author=John Renard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srZ5L70phwQC |title=Tales of God's Friends: Islamic Hagiography in Translation |date=18 May 2009 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-25896-9 |page=35 |access-date=11 February 2012}}</ref> In 1200 he took leave from one of his most important teachers, Shaykh Abu Ya'qub Yusuf ibn Yakhlaf al-Kumi, then living in the town of [[Salé]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Elmore |first=Gerald T. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mD5ogBK5eS8C&dq=Y%C5%ABsuf+al-K%C5%ABm%C4%AB&pg=PA69 |title=Islamic Sainthood in the Fullness of Time: Ibn Al-ʻArabī's Book of the Fabulous Gryphon |publisher=Brill |year=1999 |isbn=978-90-04-10991-9 |pages=69 |language=en}}</ref>

===Journey north===
[[File:Ibn Arabi Books.png|thumb|240px|Medieval list of Ibn Arabi's books.]]
After spending time in Mecca, he traveled throughout [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Iraq]] and [[Anatolia]]. In 1204, Ibn Arabi met Shaykh Majduddīn Isḥāq ibn Yūsuf (شيخ مجد الدين إسحاق بن يوسف), a native of [[Malatya]] and a man of great standing at the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] court. This time Ibn Arabi was travelling north; first they visited [[Medina]] and in 1205 they entered [[Baghdad]]. This visit offered him a chance to meet the direct disciples of [[Abdul Qadir Gilani|Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qādir Jīlānī.]] Ibn Arabi stayed there only for 12 days because he wanted to visit [[Mosul]] to see his friend ‘Alī ibn ‘Abdallāh ibn Jāmi’, a disciple of the mystic Qaḍīb al-Bān (471-573 AH/1079-1177 AD; قضيب البان).<ref>Testament to Qaḍīb al-Bān's life exists in a manuscript at the [[University of Baghdad]] (no. 541).</ref> There he spent the month of [[Ramaḍan]] and composed ''Tanazzulāt al-Mawṣiliyya'' (تنزلات الموصلية), ''Kitāb al-Jalāl wa’l-Jamāl'' (كتاب الجلال والجمال, "The Book of Majesty and Beauty") and ''Kunh mā lā Budda lil-MurīdMinhu''.<ref name=hirtenstein>{{cite book|last=Hirtenstein|first=Stephen|title=The Unlimited Mercifier, The Spiritual life and thought of Ibn 'Arabi|isbn=978-0953451326|publisher=Anqa Publishing & White Cloud Press|year=1999}}</ref>

===Return south===
In the year 1206, Ibn Arabi visited [[Jerusalem]], Mecca and [[Egypt]]. It was his first time that he passed through Syria, visiting [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]].

Later in 1207 he returned to Mecca where he continued to study and write, spending his time with his friend Abū Shujā bin Rustem and family, including Niẓām.<ref name=hirtenstein/>

The next four to five years of Ibn Arabi's life were spent in these lands and he also kept travelling and holding the reading sessions of his works in his own presence.<ref>Islaahe Nafs ka AAiena e Haq</ref>

=== Final years ===
[[File:الفتوحات_المكية.jpg|alt=|thumb|Opening pages of the [[Konya]] manuscript of the ''[[Meccan Revelations]]'', handwritten by Ibn Arabi.]][[File:Maqam Ibn-'arabi2.jpg|thumb|Ibn Arabi's tomb in Damascus]]
After leaving Andalusia for the last time at the age of 33 (1198 AD) and wandering in the Islamic world for about 25 years, at the age of 58 Ibn Arabi chose [[Damascus]] as his final home and dedicated his life for teaching and writing.<ref name=":2" /> In this city, he composed ''Fuṣūṣ Al-Ḥikam'' in 1229<ref name=":4" /> and finalized two manuscripts of ''Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya'' in 1231 and 1234.<ref name=":2" />

==Death==
Ibn Arabi died on 22 Rabī‘ al-Thānī 638 AH (16 November 1240) at the age of 75. He was buried in the Banu Zaki cemetery, family cemetery of the nobles of Damascus, on Qasiyun Hill, Salihiyya, Damascus.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tomb of Ibn al-'Arabi |url=https://www.qantara-med.org/public/show_document.php?do_id=1268&lang=en |access-date=December 14, 2022 |website=Qandara: Mediterranean Heritage}}</ref>

==Legacy==
After his death, Ibn Arabi's teachings quickly spread throughout the Islamic world. His writings were not limited to Muslim elites, but made their way into other ranks of society through the widespread reach of the Sufi orders. Arabi's work also popularly spread through works in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu. Many popular poets were trained in the Sufi orders and were inspired by Arabi's concepts.<ref>Chittick 2007, p. 2-3.</ref>

Others scholars in his time like [[al-Munawi]], [[Ibn al-Imad al-Hanbali|Ibn 'Imad al-Hanbali]] and [[Fairuzabadi|al-Fayruzabadi]] all praised Ibn Arabi as "A righteous friend of Allah and faithful scholar of knowledge", "the absolute [[Ijtihad|mujtahid]] (independent thinker) without doubt" and "the imam of the people of [[Sharia|shari'a]] both in knowledge and in legacy, the educator of the people of the way in practice and in knowledge, and the shaykh of the shaykhs of the people of truth though spiritual experience ("dhawq") and understanding".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ibn |first=Khafif |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFmKGFZTTcoC&q=the+imam+of+the+people+of+shari'a+both+in+knowledge+and+in+legacy,+the+educator+of+the+people+of+the+way+in+pactice+and+in+knowledge,+and+the+shaykh+of+the+shaykhs+of+the+people+of+truth+though+spiritual+experience+(dhawq)+and+understanding&pg=RA1-PA3 |title=Correct Islamic Doctrine/Islamic Doctrine |date=1999 |publisher=ISCA |isbn=978-1-930409-01-9 |language=en}}</ref>

==Islamic law==
Although Ibn Arabi stated on more than one occasion that he did not blindly follow any one of the [[Madhhab|schools]] of Islamic [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]], he was responsible for copying and preserving books of the [[Ẓāhirī|Zahirite]] or literalist school, to which there is fierce debate whether or not Ibn Arabi followed that school.<ref>Mohammed Rustom, [http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/MR-Chodkiewicz.pdf Review of Michel Chodkiewicz's An Ocean without Shore]</ref><ref>Hamza Dudgeon, "The Counter-Current Movements of Andalusia and Ibn ʿArabī: Should Ibn ʿArabī be considered a Ẓāhirī?" 2018, Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi Society Vol. 64. https://www.academia.edu/36173562/The_Counter_Current_Movements_of_Andalusia_and_Ibn_%CA%BFArab%C4%AB_Should_Ibn_%CA%BFArab%C4%AB_be_considered_a_%E1%BA%92%C4%81hir%C4%AB</ref> [[Ignác Goldziher|Ignaz Goldziher]] held that Ibn Arabi did in fact belong to the [[Ẓāhirī|Zahirite]] or [[Hanbali]] school of Islamic jurisprudence.<ref>[[Ignác Goldziher|Ignaz Goldziher]], The Ẓāhirīs: Their Doctrine and Their History, ed. and trans. by Wolfgang Behn (Leiden: Brill, 1971), 169.</ref> Hamza Dudgeon claims that Addas, Chodkiewizc, Gril, Winkel and Al-Gorab mistakenly attribute to Ibn ʿArabī non-madhhabism.<ref>Dudgeon, "The Counter-Current Movements of Andalusia and Ibn ʿArabī: Should Ibn ʿArabī be considered a Ẓāhirī?," 104.</ref><ref>Hamza Dudgeon,  "Review of Sufis and Sharīʿa: The Forgotten School of Mercy" in the ''Journal of Muhyiddin Ibn ‘Arabi Society'' 74 (2023): https://www.academia.edu/101952124/Review_of_Sufis_and_Shar%C4%AB%CA%BFa_The_Forgotten_School_of_Mercy.</ref> 

On an extant manuscript of Ibn Ḥazm, as transmitted by Ibn ʿArabī, Ibn ʿArabī gives an introduction to the work where he describes a vision he had:

{{Quote
|text=“I saw myself in the village of Sharaf near Siville; there I saw a plain on which rose an elevation. On this elevation the Prophet stood, and a man whom I did not know, approached him; they embraced each other so violently that they seemed to interpenetrate and become one person. Great brightness concealed them from the eyes of the people. ‘I would like to know,’ I thought, ‘who is this strange man.’ Then I heard some one say: ‘This is the traditionalist ʿAlī Ibn Ḥazm.’ I had never heard Ibn Ḥazm’s name before. One of my shaykhs, whom I questioned, informed me that this man is an authority in the field of science of [[Hadeeth]].”
|author=Goldziher
|source=''The Ẓāhirīs: Their Doctrine and Their History'' (1971)
}}Goldziher says, "The period between the sixth (hijri) and the seventh century seems also to have been the prime of the Ẓāhirite school in Andalusia."<ref>Goldziher, The Ẓāhirīs, 170-171</ref>

Ibn Arabi did delve into specific details at times, and was known for his view that religiously binding [[Ijma|consensus]] could only serve as a source of sacred law if it was the consensus of the [[Sahaba|first generation]] of Muslims who had witnessed revelation directly.<ref name=ali281>[[Chiragh Ali]], The Proposed Political, Legal and Social Reforms. Taken from Modernist Islam 1840-1940: A Sourcebook, pg. 281. Edited by [[Charles Kurzman]]. [[New York City]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2002.</ref>

Ibn Arabi also expounded on Sufi Allegories of the Sharia building upon previous work by [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi]].<ref> Hamza Dudgeon, "The Revival of Sharia’s Allegories," 2019 Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi Society Vol. 66. https://www.academia.edu/40585698/The_Revival_of_Sharia_s_Allegories</ref>

==Theoretical mysticism==
Ibn Arabi is counted as the founder of the great schools of mystical school of thought in the history of [[Islam]]. He had lived in the milieu which had a spiritual atmosphere full of mystical and esoteric experiences. Many mystical currents and movements were prevalent in Islamic Andalusia. Some such as Ibn Barrajan, Ibn Arif and Ibn Qasi give a dynamism to mysticism.  Also, the social and spiritual atmosphere of Islamic East – such as Iran, Syria and Iraq – had affected these milieu. Among these conditions are schools such as [[Avicennism]], [[Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi|Suhrawardi]] and the [[Illuminationism|Illumination school]], Gnostic, etc.

In his adolescent and youth period, there are many mystical currents in his production. He referred to nearly seventy teachers in one of his works.<ref name="Heir to the Prophets">{{cite book |last1=Chittick |first1=William C. |title=Ibn ʻArabi: Heir to the Prophets |date=2005 |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford |isbn=9781851683871}}</ref>

===Knowledge===
Ibn Arabi believes in three kinds of knowledge. The first kind is rational knowledge which is the conclusion of theoretical reason. This knowledge could be true and/or false.<ref name="Great Islamic Encyclopedia Center">{{cite web |title=افزودن به کتابخانه من درباره کتاب نوشتن یادداشت خرید کتاب دربــارهابن عربی، ابو عبدالله|url=http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/2388 |website=The Great Islamic Encyclopedia, Volume 4 |access-date=23 May 2021}}</ref> The second kind of knowledge is delight(dhawq) which is not acquired by rational reflection. In other word it is impossible to bring them into any argument or proofs for reason. The knowledge of love, pleasure or sexual intercourse are samples for second knowledge. The third knowledge is mysterious knowledge which is beyond boundaries of reason. This knowledge is dedicated to divine prophets and his disciples. This knowledge is also called a divine knowledge by Ibn Arabi. He believes that true knowledge, namely knowledge of something in itself, just belonged to God and every [[definition of knowledge]] is useless. Knowledge has a divine nature. According to him, real Being has eternal consciousness of its reality. This real Being has the One-many nature. In other words, God is named by many names whilst it is one singular reality.

===Imagination===
According to [[William Chittick]], little attention has been paid to the importance of imagination in Ibn Arabi. Before Ibn Arabi, imagination counted as one faculty among senses but Ibn Arabi tried to develop it conceptually. He interpreted imagination as follows: all beings are images of real Being and non-being. In other words, all things have two dimensions of being and non being.<ref name="Heir to the Prophets"/>{{rp|106–107}} The universe and all other things counted as imagination which has a middle nature between sheer reality and utter nothing. All things, in fact, are considered as qualities and reflections of one thing in many ways.<ref name="Imaginal worlds">{{cite book |last1=Chittick |first1=William C. |title=Imaginal worlds: Ibn al-ʻArabī and the problem of religious diversity |date=1994 |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |isbn=978-0-7914-2249-6}}</ref> Iit refers to theory of the unity of existence.

===Al-Insān al-kāmil===
The doctrine of perfect man (''[[Al-Insān al-Kāmil]]'') is popularly considered an honorific title attributed to [[Muhammad]] having its origins in Islamic mysticism, although the concept's origin is controversial and disputed.<ref>Chittick, William C. "Ebn al-‘Arabi Mohyi-al- Din Abu ‘Abd-Allah Mohammad Ta’I Hatemi." Encyclopedia Iranica (1996): Web. 3 Apr 2011. <http://iranica.com/articles/ebn-al-arabi {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719015334/http://iranica.com/articles/ebn-al-arabi |date=2011-07-19 }}></ref> Arabi may have first coined this term in referring to Adam as found in his work ''Fusus al-hikam'', explained as an individual who binds himself with the Divine and creation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Coeli|last2=Walker|first2=Adam Hani|date=2014|title=Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AtvBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA440|location=Santa Barbara, California|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=440|isbn=978-1610691772}}</ref>

Taking an idea already common within Sufi culture, Ibn Arabi applied deep analysis and reflection on the concept of a perfect human and one's pursuit in fulfilling this goal. In developing his explanation of the perfect being, Ibn Arabi first discusses the issue of oneness through the metaphor of the mirror.<ref name="Little, John T. 1987">{{cite journal|last=Little|first=John T.|title=Al-Insān Al-Kāmil: The Perfect Man According to Ibn Al-'arabi|date=January 1987|journal=The Muslim World|volume=77|issue=1|pages=43–54|doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x}}</ref>

In this philosophical metaphor, Ibn Arabi compares an object being reflected in countless mirrors to the relationship between God and his creatures. God's essence is seen in the existent human being, as God is the object and human beings the mirrors. Meaning two things; that since humans are mere reflections of God there can be no distinction or separation between the two and, without God the creatures would be non-existent. When an individual understands that there is no separation between human and God they begin on the path of ultimate oneness. The one who decides to walk in this oneness pursues the true reality and responds to God's longing to be known. The search within for this reality of oneness causes one to be reunited with God, as well as, improve self-consciousness.<ref name="Little, John T. 1987"/>

The perfect human, through this developed self-consciousness and self-realization, prompts divine self-manifestation. This causes the perfect human to be of both divine and earthly origin. Ibn Arabi metaphorically calls him an [[Isthmus]]. Being an Isthmus between heaven and Earth, the perfect human fulfills God's desire to be known. God's presence can be realized through him by others. Ibn Arabi expressed that through self manifestation one acquires divine knowledge, which he called the primordial spirit of Muhammad and all its perfection. Ibn Arabi details that the perfect human is of the cosmos to the divine and conveys the divine spirit to the cosmos.<ref name="Little, John T. 1987"/>

Ibn Arabi further explained the perfect man concept using at least twenty-two different descriptions and various aspects when considering the [[Logos]].<ref name="Little, John T. 1987"/> He contemplated the Logos, or "Universal Man", as a mediation between the individual human and the divine essence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dobie|first=Robert J.date=17 November 2009|title=Logos and Revelation: Ibn 'Arabi, Meister Eckhart, and Mystical Hermeneutics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWVwT3UpthUC&pg=PA225|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press|page=225|isbn=978-0813216775|quote="For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence."|year=2010}}</ref>

Ibn Arabi believed Muhammad to be the primary perfect man who exemplifies the morality of God.<ref>Fitzpatrick and Walker 2014, p. 445</ref> Ibn Arabi regarded the first entity brought into existence was the reality or essence of Muhammad (''al-ḥaqīqa al-Muhammadiyya''), master of all creatures, and a primary role-model for human beings to emulate. Ibn Arabi believed that God's attributes and names are manifested in this world, with the most complete and perfect display of these divine attributes and names seen in Muhammad. Ibn Arabi believed that one may see God in the mirror of Muhammad. He maintained that Muhammad was the best proof of God and, by knowing Muhammad, one knows God.<ref name="fitz">Fitzpatrick and Walker 2014, p. 446</ref>

Ibn Arabi also described Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and all other prophets and various ''Anbiya' Allah'' (Muslim messengers) as perfect men, but never tires of attributing lordship, inspirational source, and highest rank to Muhammad.<ref name="fitz"/><ref name="insan">{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqZTDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA15|title=Rethinking Ibn 'Arabi|page=15|author=Gregory A. Lipton|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190684518|date=2018-04-02}}</ref> Ibn Arabi compares his own status as a perfect man as being but a single dimension to the comprehensive nature of Muhammad.<ref name="insan"/> Ibn 'Arabi makes extraordinary assertions regarding his own spiritual rank, but qualifying this rather audacious correlation by asserting his "inherited" perfection is only a single dimension of the comprehensive perfection of Muhammad.<ref name="insan"/>

==Reaction==
{{See also|Tanbih al-Ghabi bi-Tabri'at Ibn 'Arabi}}
The reaction of [[Ibn 'Abd as-Salam]], a Muslim scholar respected by both Ibn Arabi's supporters and detractors, has been of note due to disputes over whether he himself was a supporter or detractor. He was known by the title of Sultan al-'Ulama, the Sultan of scholars, was a famous [[mujtahid]], [[Ash'ari]] theologian, jurist and the leading [[Shafi'i school|Shafi'i]] authority of his generation.<ref>Bosworth, C.E.; van Donzel, E.; Heinrichs, W.P.; Lecomte, G. (1997). Encyclopaedia of Islam. Vol. IX (San-Sze) (New ed.). Leiden, Netherlands: Brill. p. 812. ISBN 9004104224.</ref> As such, the figure of Ibn 'Abd al-Salam was claimed by each faction of the Ibn-'Arabi controversy due to his impeccable record as a staunch champion of the [[Sharia|shari'a]].<ref>Knysh, A., 1999. Ibn ʻArabi in the later Islamic tradition. Albany: State University of New York Press, pp.79</ref>

[[Ibn Taymiyyah]]'s report was based on the authority of two reliable transmitters, [https://www.taraajem.com/persons/114101/أبو-بكر-بن-عمر-بن-السلار Abu Bakr b. Salar] and [[Ibn Daqiq al-'Id]]. According to it, Ibn 'Abd al-Salam declared Ibn 'Arabi "a master of evil" and "a disgusting man", who "professed the eternity of the world and did not proscribe fornication."<ref>Majmūʿat al-rasāʾil wa al-masāʾil, vol. 4, pp. 73 and 75</ref> This severe verdict, whose authenticity Ibn Taymiyyah considered to be beyond doubt, was pronounced by Ibn 'Abd al-Salam upon his arrival in Egypt in 639/1241- that is, one year after his death.<ref>(Knysh, 1999), p.66</ref> The versions of the story furnished by [[al-Safadi]], a cautious supporter of Ibn 'Arabi, and [[al-Dhahabi]], his bitter critic, and teacher of al-Safadi, are especially helpful in placing Ibn 'Abd al-Salam's censure into a meaningful historical framework. Both al-Safadi and al-Dhahabi insisted that they read the story recorded in [[Fath al-Din Ibn Sayyid al-Nas|Ibn Sayyid al-Nas]]'s own hand. And yet, their versions vary. Both variants describe Ibn Daqiq al-'Id's astonishment at his teacher's sharp critique of the acclaimed [[wali]], which caused him to ask for proof of Ibn 'Arabi's lies. Ibn 'Abd al-Salam obliged by the following reply (in al-Safadi's recension):<ref>(Knysh, 1999), p.67</ref> "He used to deny [the possibility] of marriage between human beings and the [[jinn]], since, according to him, the jinn are subtle spirits, whereas human beings are solid bodies, hence the two cannot unite. Later on, however, he claimed that he had married a woman from the jinnfolk, who stayed with him for a while, then hit him with a camel's bone and injured him. He used to show us the scar on his face which, by that time, had closed."<ref>Al-Wafi, vol. 4, p. 174</ref> In al-Dhahabi's rendition: "He [Ibn 'Arabi] said: I married a she-jinni, and she blessed me with three children. Then it so happened that I made her angry and she hit me with a bone that caused this scar, whereupon she departed and I have never seen her again since."<ref>Al-Dhahabi. Mizan, vol. 3, p. 656</ref> The authenticity of Ibn 'Abd al-Salam's disparagement of Ibn 'Arabi seems to find support in his "Epistle on the [Saintly] Substitutes and the [Supreme] Succor" (Risala fil-'abdal wal-ghawth)<ref>(Knysh, 1999), p.72</ref>

On the other hand, another narration in praise of Ibn 'Arabi by al-Izz is reported by [https://tarajm.com/people/10313 'Abd al-Ghaffar al-Qusi], [[Fairuzabadi|al-Fayruzabadi]], [[:ar:جعفر بن أحمد السراج|al-Qari al-Baghdadi]], [[al-Suyuti]], [[al-Sha'rani]], [[Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari|al-Maqqari]], [[Ibn al-Imad al-Hanbali|Ibn al-'Imad]], and some other supporters. Despite minor variations in their accounts, all of them cite the same source: lbn 'Abd al-Salam's unnamed servant or student. In al-Qusi's redaction, Ibn 'Abd al Salam and his servant were passing by Ibn 'Arabi, who instructed his disciples in the Great [[Umayyad Mosque]] of Damuscus. Suddenly, the servant recalled that Ibn 'Abd al-Salam had promised to reveal to him the identity of the supreme saint of the epoch, the "Pole of the Age". The question caught Ibn 'Abd al-Salam off guard. He paused hesitantly for a moment, then pointed in the direction of Ibn 'Arabi, saying: "He is the Pole!" "And this in spite of what you have said against him?" asked the servant. Ibn 'Abd al-Salam ignored this remark and simply repeated his reply.<ref>(Knysh, 1999), p.74</ref> In al-Fayruzabadi's version of the story, Ibn 'Abd al-Salam is presented as a secret admirer of his who was fully aware of the latter's exalted status in the Sufi hierarchy. However, as a public figure, Ibn 'Abd al-Salam was careful to conceal his genuine opinion of the controversial Sufi in order to "preserve the outward aspect of the religious law". In so doing, he, according to al-Fayruzabadi, shrewdly avoided an inevitable confrontation with the "jurists," who viewed Ibn 'Arabi as a heretic.<ref>(Knysh, 1999), p.75</ref>

The importance of Ibn 'Abd al-Salam's ambiguous evaluation of Ibn Arabi for the subsequent polemic is further attested by the detailed treatment of this story in al-Fasi's massive biographical dictionary, "The Precious Necklace" (al-'lqd al-thamin). A bitter critic of Ibn 'Arabi's monistic views, [[Taqi al-Din al-Fasi|al-Fasi]] rejected the Sufi version of the story as sheer fabrication. Yet, as a scrupulous [[muhaddith]], he tried to justify his position through the methods current in hadith criticism:<ref>(Knysh, 1999), p.76</ref> "I have a strong suspicion that this story was invented by the extremist Sufis who were infatuated with Ibn 'Arabi. Thereupon the story gained wide diffusion until it reached some trustworthy people, who accepted it in good faith .... My suspicion regarding the authenticity of this story has grown stronger because of the unfounded supposition that Ibn 'Abd al-Salam's praise of Ibn 'Arabi had occurred simultaneously with his censure of him. Ibn 'Abd al-Salam's statement that he censured Ibn 'Arabi out of concern for the shari'a inescapably implies that Ibn 'Arabi enjoyed a high rank in the same moment as Ibn 'Abd al-Salam was censuring him. Such a blunder could not have happened to any reliable religious scholar, let alone to someone as knowledgeable and righteous as Ibn 'Abd al-Salam. Anyone who suspects him of this makes a mistake and commits a sin [by holding him responsible for] mutually contradictory statements .... One may try to explain Ibn 'Abd al-Salam's praise of Ibn 'Arabi, if it indeed took place, by the fact that [Ibn 'Abd al-Salam] was hesitating between praise and censure, because at the time he spoke Ibn 'Arabi's state had changed for the better. If so, there is no contradiction in Ibn 'Abd al-Salam's words. Were we to admit that the praise really occurred, it was nevertheless abrogated by Ibn Daqiq al-'Id's report concerning lbn 'Abd al-Salam's [later] condemnation of lbn 'Arabi. For Ibn Daqiq al-'Id could only hear Ibn 'Abd al-Salam in Egypt, that is, a few years after Ibn 'Arabi's death. This cannot be otherwise because he ... was educated at Qus, where he had studied the [[Maliki]] madhhab, until he mastered it completely. Only then he came to Cairo to study the Shafi'i madhhab and other sciences under Ibn 'Abd al-Salam's guidance. ... His departure could only take place after 640, by which time Ibn 'Arabi had already been dead. ... Now, Ibn 'Abd al-Salam's praise, as the story itself testifies, occurred when Ibn 'Arabi was still alive.

===The Meccan Illuminations (Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya)===
{{main|Meccan Revelations}}
According to [[Claude Addas]], Ibn Arabi began writing ''Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya'' after he arrived in Mecca in 1202. After almost thirty years, the first draft of ''Futūḥāt'' was completed in December 1231 (629 AH), and Ibn Arabi bequeathed it to his son.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Ibn ʻArabī, the voyage of no return|last=Addas, Claude.|date=2000|publisher=Islamic Texts Society|isbn=0946621748|location=Cambridge, CB, UK|oclc=41925362}}</ref> Two years before his death, Ibn ‘Arabī embarked on a second draft of the ''Futūḥāt'' in 1238 (636 AH),<ref name=":0" /> of which included a number of additions and deletions as compared with the previous draft, that contains 560 chapters. The second draft, the more widely circulated version, was bequeathed to his disciple, [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi]]. There are many scholars attempt to translate this book from Arabic into other languages, but there is no complete translation of ''Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya'' to this day.

===The Bezels of Wisdom (Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam)===
There have been many commentaries on Ibn 'Arabī's ''Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam'': Osman Yahya named more than 100 while [[Michel Chodkiewicz]] precises that "this list is far from exhaustive."<ref>Michel Chodkiewicz, ''An Ocean Without Shore: Ibn Arabi, the Book, and the Law'', SUNY Press (1993), p. 59</ref> The first one was ''Kitab al-Fukūk'' written by [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi|Ṣadr al-Dīn al-Qunawī]] who had studied the book with Ibn 'Arabī; the second by Qunawī's student, Mu'ayyad al-Dīn al-Jandi, which was the first line-by-line commentary; the third by Jandī's student, [[Dawūd al-Qayṣarī|Dawūd al-Qaysarī]], which became very influential in the Persian-speaking world. A recent English translation of Ibn 'Arabī's own summary of the ''Fuṣūṣ, Naqsh al-Fuṣūṣ'' (The Imprint or Pattern of the Fusus) as well a commentary on this work by [[Jami|'Abd al-Raḥmān Jāmī]], ''Naqd al-Nuṣūṣ fī Sharḥ Naqsh al-Fuṣūṣ'' (1459), by [[William Chittick]] was published in Volume 1 of the ''Journal of the [[Mohyeddin|Muhyiddin]] Ibn 'Arabi Society'' (1982).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/journals.html |title=Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi Society |publisher=Ibnarabisociety.org |access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref>

==== Critical editions and translations of Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam ====
The ''Fuṣūṣ'' was first critically edited in Arabic by 'Afīfī (1946) that become the standard in scholarly works. Later in 2015, Ibn al-Arabi Foundation in Pakistan published the Urdu translation, including the new critical of Arabic edition.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://ibnularabifoundation.org/index.php/publications/fusus-al-hikam|title=Fusus al-Hikam|publisher=Ibn al-Arabi Foundation|others=translator: Abrar Ahmed Shahi|year=2015|editor1-last=Sultan al-Mansub|editor1-first=Abd al-Aziz|editor2-last=Shahī|editor2-first=Abrar Ahmed}}</ref>

The only major commentary to have been translated into English so far is entitled ''[[Bursalı İsmail Hakkı|Ismail Hakki Bursevi]]'s translation and commentary on Fusus al-hikam by [[Mohyeddin|Muhyiddin]] Ibn 'Arabi'', translated from Ottoman Turkish by [[Bulent Rauf]] in 4 volumes (1985–1991).

In Urdu, the most widespread and authentic translation was made by Shams Ul Mufasireen Bahr-ul-uloom Hazrat (Muhammad Abdul Qadeer Siddiqi Qadri -Hasrat), the former Dean and Professor of Theology of the [[Osmania University]], [[Hyderabad, Telangana|Hyderabad]]. It is due to this reason that his translation is in the curriculum of Punjab University. Maulvi Abdul Qadeer Siddiqui has made an interpretive translation and explained the terms and grammar while clarifying the Shaikh's opinions. A new edition of the translation was published in 2014 with brief annotations throughout the book for the benefit of contemporary Urdu reader.<ref>[http://www.guldustah.com/fusoos-ul-hikam.html Fusus Al Hikam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704094712/http://www.guldustah.com/fusoos-ul-hikam.html |date=2015-07-04 }}, Translated by Muhammad Abdul Qadeer Siddiqui, Annotated by Mohammed Abdul Ahad Siddiqui, 2014 Kitab Mahal, Darbar Market, Lahore, Online Version at [http://www.guldustah.com/ guldustah.com]</ref>
