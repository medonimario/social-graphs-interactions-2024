'''Étienne Cabet''' ({{IPA|fr|etjɛn kabɛ|lang}}; January 1, 1788 – November 9, 1856) was a [[French philosophy|French philosopher]] and [[utopian socialist]] who founded the [[Icarians|Icarian movement]]. Cabet became the most popular socialist advocate of his day, with a special appeal to artisans who were being undercut by factories. Cabet published ''[[Voyage en Icarie]]'' in French in 1839 (and in English in 1840 as ''Travels in Icaria''), in which he proposed replacing capitalist production with workers' cooperatives. Recurrent problems with French officials (a treason conviction in 1834 resulted in five years' exile in England), led him to emigrate to the United States in 1848. Cabet founded utopian communities in [[Texas]] and [[Illinois]], but was again undercut, this time by recurring feuds with his followers.

==Early and family life==
{{Socialism US|people}}
Cabet was born in [[Dijon]], [[Côte-d'Or]], the youngest son of a cooper from Burgundy, Claude Cabet, and his wife Francoise Berthier. He was educated as a lawyer.{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=57}} Cabet married Delphine Lasage on March 25, 1839 at [[Marylebone]], London, during his exile in England, who bore a child.<ref>British parish records on ancestry.com; the child may have been Gentilly Cabet, who married Eugene Dagousset in Paris in 1891 according to another ancestry.com database</ref>

==Career in France==

Cabet secured an appointment as attorney-general in [[Corsica]]. He represented the government of [[Louis Philippe]], despite having headed an insurrectionary committee during the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 which led to the ouster of the "Republican Monarch" King Charles X (and the ascent of Louis Philippe). However, Cabet lost this position for his attack upon the conservatism of the government in his ''Histoire de la révolution de 1830''.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cabet, Étienne}}</ref> Nonetheless, in 1831, Cabet was elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]] in [[France]] as the representative of [[Côte-d'Or|Côte d'Or]], and sat with the extreme radicals.<ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Cabet, Etienne|year=1905}}</ref>
Accused of treason in 1834 because of his bitter attacks on the government both in the history book and subsequently, Cabet was convicted and sentenced to five years' exile.{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=58}} He fled to England and sought political asylum. Influenced by [[Robert Owen]], [[Thomas More]] and [[Charles Fourier]], Cabet wrote ''Voyage et aventures de lord William Carisdall en Icarie'' ("Travel and Adventures of Lord William Carisdall in Icaria", 1840), which depicted a [[utopia]] in which a democratically elected governing body controlled all economic activity and closely supervised social life. "Icaria" is the name of his [[fictional country]] and ideal society. The nuclear family remained the only other independent unit. The book's success prompted Cabet to take steps to realize his Utopia.<ref name=nie/>

In 1839, Cabet returned to France to advocate a [[communitarian]] [[social movement]], for which he invented the term ''communisme''.<ref name="communisme">{{cite web|url=http://raforum.info/mot.php3?id_mot=844|title=CABET, Etienne (1788-1856) Fondateur du communisme en France|publisher=Recherches sur l’anarchisme|access-date=2007-02-27|archive-date=2008-06-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629032913/http://raforum.info/mot.php3?id_mot=844|url-status=dead}}</ref> Some writers ignored Cabet's [[Christian philosophy|Christian influences]], as described in his book ''Le vrai christianisme suivant Jésus Christ'' ("The real [[Christianity]] according to Jesus Christ", in five volumes, 1846). This book described [[Christian communism|Christ's mission to be to establish social equality]], and contrasted primitive Christianity with the ecclesiasticism of Cabet's time to the disparagement of the latter. In it, Cabet argued that the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|kingdom of God]] announced by Jesus was nothing other than a communist society.<ref>[[Paul Bénichou]], ''Le Sacre de l'écrivain : Doctrines de l'âge romantique'' (Paris: Gallimard, 1977), p. 402 n.63.</ref> The book also contained a popular history of the French Revolutions from 1789 to 1830.<ref name=nie/>

In 1841 Cabet revived the ''Populaire'' (founded by him in 1833), which was widely read by French workingmen, and from 1843 to 1847 he printed an Icarian almanac, a number of controversial pamphlets as well as the above-mentioned book on Christianity. There were probably 400,000 adherents of the Icarian school.<ref name=nie/>

==Emigration to the United States of America==
In 1847, after realizing the economic hardship caused by the depression of 1846, Cabet gave up on the notion of reforming French society.{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=59}} Instead, after conversations with [[Robert Owen]] and Owen's attempts to found a commune in Texas, Cabet gathered a group of followers from across France and traveled to the [[United States]] to organize an [[Icarians|Icarian]] community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Friesen|first1=John W.|last2=Friesen|first2=Virginia Lyons|title=The Palgrave Companion to North American Utopias|url=https://archive.org/details/palgravecompanio0000frie|url-access=registration|date=2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/palgravecompanio0000frie/page/137 137]|isbn=9781403963994 }}</ref> They entered into a social contract, making Cabet the director-in-chief for the first ten years, and embarked from [[Le Havre]], February 3, 1848, for [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. They expected to settle in the [[Red River of the South|Red River valley]] in [[Texas]]. However, the Peters Land Company gave them deeds to only 320 acres of land in [[Denton County, Texas]] near what became [[Dallas, Texas]] rather than the million acres of land in the Red River Valley they expected (more than 200 miles away).{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=59}} The first group of emigrants ultimately returned to New Orleans; Cabet came later at the head of a second and smaller band. Neither Texas nor Louisiana proved the looked-for Utopia, and, ravaged by disease, about one-third of the colonists returned to France.<ref name=nie/>

The remainder (142 men, 74 women and 64 children, although 20 died of [[cholera]] en route), moved northward along the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], where they purchased twelve acres recently vacated by the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Mormons]] in 1849.<ref name="Palgrave Macmillan">{{cite book|last1=Friesen|first1=John W.|last2=Friesen|first2=Virginia Lyons|title=The Palgrave Companion to North American Utopias|url=https://archive.org/details/palgravecompanio0000frie|url-access=registration|date=2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/palgravecompanio0000frie/page/139 139]|isbn=9781403963994 }}</ref>{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=59}} Cabet was unanimously elected leader, for a one-year term. The improved location enabled the experiment to develop into a successful agricultural community. Education and culture were highly valued by members. By 1855, the Nauvoo Icarian community had expanded to about 500 members with a solid agricultural base, as well as shops, three schools, flour and sawmills, a whiskey distillery, English and French newspapers, a 39 piece orchestra, choir, theater, hospital and the state's largest library (4000 volumes).<ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"/> Members met on Saturdays to discuss community affairs and problems, with universal male suffrage; women were allowed to speak but not vote. On Sundays members talked about ethical and moral issues, but there were no denominational religious services, only members had espoused Christianity before joining the community. Based on this success, some even considered expanding the community 200 miles west to [[Adair County, Iowa]].{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=63}}

However, Cabet was forced to return to France in May 1851 to settle charges of fraud brought up by his previous followers in Europe.<ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"/><ref name="America's Communal Utopias">{{cite book|last1=Pitzer|first1=Donald|title=America's Communal Utopias|date=1997|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill and London|page=283}}</ref> Although found not guilty by a French jury in July 1851, when Cabet returned to Nauvoo in July 1852, the community had changed. Some men were using tobacco and abusing alcohol, many women were adorning themselves with fancy dresses and jewelry, and families claimed land as private property. Cabet responded by issuing "Forty-Eight Rules of Conduct" on November 23, 1853, forbidding "tobacco, hard liquor, complaints about the food, and hunting and fishing 'for pleasure'" as well as demanding absolute silence in workshops and submission to him.<ref name="America's Communal Utopias"/> Some described him as authoritarian or emotionally unstable; internal problems arose and worsened.{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=64}}

In the spring of 1855, Cabet tried to revise the colony's constitution to make him president for life, but was instead relieved of the presidency, so his followers went out on strike, and were in turn temporarily barred from the communal dining hall.{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=64}} Although the colony by then had 526 members and 57 more across the [[Mississippi River]] at [[Montrose, Iowa]], it was suffering economically—dependent upon money brought by new members and subsidies from the "Le Populaire" home office in France.<ref name="America's Communal Utopias"/>{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=64}}

Moreover, split regarding the work division and food distribution worsened during the summer and following year.<ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"/> Cabet published his final book, ''Colonie icarienne aux États-Unis d'Amérique'' (1856), but that failed to solve the internal problems. In October 1856, about 180 supporters and Cabet left Nauvoo in three groups for [[Ozora, Missouri|New Bremen, Missouri]] near [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].

==Death and legacy==
Cabet suffered a stroke on November 8, 1856, a few days after moving to Missouri with the last group of his followers, and soon died.<ref>Ancestry.com's Missouri Registry of Deaths for the week of November 10, 1856, p. 122</ref> He was buried at the Old Picker's Cemetery, but his remains were moved during construction of [[Roosevelt High School (St. Louis)|a high school on the site]], and now rest at New Saint Marcus Cemetery and Mausoleum in [[Affton, Missouri|Affton]], [[St. Louis County, Missouri]], with a gravestone funded by the French Embassy.

On February 15, 1858, the remaining [[Icarians]] settled in [[Cheltenham, St. Louis|Cheltenham]] on the western edge of St. Louis, under the leadership of a lawyer named Mercadier, whom Cabet had designated as his successor. That colony would disband in 1864 (with several young men fighting in the American Civil War) and two families rejoined the Icarians in Corning, Iowa discussed below (the Cheltenham area became a neighborhood within St. Louis).{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=65}} Before his death, Cabet sued the Nauvoo Icarians in a local court, as well as petitioned the Illinois legislature to repeal the act that incorporated the community.<ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"/><ref>Some miscellaneous handwritten records of the Hancock County, Illinois court relative to "E. Cabbett" are available in ancestry.com's library edition, images 1117-1119 of 1825-1858 records</ref> The Nauvoo colony relocated to [[Corning, Iowa|Corning]], [[Adams County, Iowa]], about 80 miles southwest of [[Des Moines, Iowa]] between 1858 and 1860, because of Illinois crop failures as well as the end of financial support from France following the [[Panic of 1857]]. The Corning [[Icarians]] prospered until another factional split in 1878, prompted by new emigrants from France, who left to establish a community in [[Cloverdale, California]] in 1883 (but "Icaria Speranza" lasted only four years). The colony at Corning disbanded in 1898, but by that time it had existed for 46 years, making it the longest non-religious communal living experiment in American history.{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=65}}

The library at [[Western Illinois University]] has a Center for Icarian Studies, as well as Icarian archives and papers. The Nauvoo Historical Society also has some papers and artifacts on display, and some in the town remember the Icarians during the Labor Day Grape Festival, through a historical play. The connection with grape cultivation is more symbolic than foundational, as the growing of Concord grapes in the Nauvoo area did not begin with the Icarians. It sprang from efforts by a French Catholic priest in the 1830s, and expanded in 1846 when Swiss vintner John Tanner brought the Norton grape to the area. However, Baxter's Vineyards and Winery was founded by [[Icarians]] Emile and Annette Baxter in 1857, and continues as a 5-generation old family business. It is Illinois' oldest winery.{{sfn |Soland |2017 |p=65}}
