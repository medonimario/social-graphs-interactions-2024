Herschel originated the use of the [[Julian day]] system in [[astronomy]]. He named seven [[moons of Saturn]] and four [[moons of Uranus]] – the seventh planet, discovered by his father [[Sir William Herschel]]. He made many contributions to the science of photography, and investigated [[colour blindness]] and the chemical power of [[ultraviolet]] rays. His ''Preliminary Discourse'' (1831), which advocated an [[Inductive reasoning|inductive approach]] to scientific experiment and theory-building, was an important contribution to the [[philosophy of science]].{{sfn|Cobb|2012|pp=409–439}}

Herschel was born in [[Slough]], Buckinghamshire, the son of Mary Baldwin and astronomer [[Sir William Herschel]]. He was the nephew of astronomer [[Caroline Herschel]]. He studied shortly at [[Eton College]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], graduating as [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1813.<ref name="Venn" /> It was during his time as an undergraduate that he became friends with the mathematicians [[Charles Babbage]] and [[George Peacock (mathematician)|George Peacock]].<ref name=HersNAH/> He left Cambridge in 1816 and started working with his father. He took up astronomy in 1816, building a [[reflecting telescope]] with a mirror {{convert|18|in|mm}} in diameter, and with a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} [[focal length]]. Between 1821 and 1823 he re-examined, with [[James South]], the double stars catalogued by his father.<ref name="EB1911" /> He was one of the founders of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820. For his work with his father, he was presented with the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1826 (which he won again in 1836), and with the [[Lalande Medal]] of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1825, while in 1821 the [[Royal Society]] bestowed upon him the [[Copley Medal]] for his mathematical contributions to their Transactions. Herschel was made a Knight of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]] in 1831.<ref name=HersNAH/> He also seemed to be aware of Indian thought and mathematics introduced to him by [[George Everest]] as claimed by Mary Boole:{{sfn|Boole|1901}}

{{Blockquote|Some time about 1825, he came to England for two or three years, and made a fast and lifelong friendship with Herschel and with Babbage, who was then quite young.(.) My uncle returned from India. He never interfered with anyone's religious beliefs or customs. But no one under his influence could continue to believe in anything in the Bible being specially sacred, except the two elements which it has in common with other sacred books: the knowledge of our relation to others and of man's power to hold direct converse with the unseen truth.}}

He stated in his historical article ''Mathematics in Brewster's Cyclopedia'':

{{Blockquote|The Brahma Sidd'hanta, the work of Brahmagupta, an Indian astronomer at the beginning of the seventh century, contains a general method for the resolution of indeterminate problems of the second degree; an investigation which actually baffled the skill of every modern analyst till the time of Lagrange's solution, not excepting the all inventive Euler himself.{{sfn|Boole|1901}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=De Morgan's Preface to Ramchundra's book|url=https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/De_Morgan_1859_Preface/|access-date=8 May 2021|website=Maths History|language=en}}</ref>}}

Herschel served as [[president of the Royal Astronomical Society]] three times: 1827–1829, 1839–1841 and 1847–1849.<ref name="RoyAstrSoc" />{{sfn |Dreyer |Turner |2014|p=250}}

Herschel's ''A preliminary discourse on the study of natural philosophy'', published early in 1831 as part of ''[[Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet cyclopædia]]'', set out methods of scientific investigation with an orderly relationship between observation and theorising. He described nature as being governed by laws which were difficult to discern or to state mathematically, and the highest aim of [[natural philosophy]] was understanding these laws through [[inductive reasoning]], finding a single unifying explanation for a phenomenon. This became an authoritative statement with wide influence on science, particularly at the [[University of Cambridge]] where it inspired the student [[Charles Darwin]] with "a burning zeal" to contribute to this work.{{sfn|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=69 67–68]}}{{sfn|Browne|1995|pp=128, 133}}{{sfn|Darwin|1985a|loc=[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-94.xml#mark-94.f2 Letter No. 94]}}

He was elected as a member to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1854.<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?year=1854;year-max=1854;smode=advanced;startDoc=21|language=en|access-date=19 April 2021|website=search.amphilsoc.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210419135604/https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?year=1854;year-max=1854;smode=advanced;startDoc=21|archive-date=19 April 2021}}</ref>

Herschel published a catalogue of his astronomical observations in 1864, as the ''[[General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters]]'', a compilation of his own work and that of his father's, expanding on the senior Herschel's ''[[Catalogue of Nebulae]]''. A further complementary volume was published posthumously, as the ''General Catalogue of 10,300 Multiple and Double Stars''.

Herschel correctly considered astigmatism to be due to irregularity of the cornea and theorised that vision could be improved by the application of some animal jelly contained in a capsule of glass against the cornea. His views were published in an article entitled Light in 1828 and the ''Encyclopædia Metropolitana'' in 1845.<ref name="anti_Cont" />

Discoveries of Herschel include the galaxies [[NGC 7]], [[NGC 10]], [[NGC 25]], and [[NGC 28]].

Herschel had his own inherited money and he paid £500 for passage on the S.S. ''Mountstuart Elphinstone''. He, his wife, their three children and his 20 inch telescope departed from [[Portsmouth]] on 13 November 1833.<ref name="ODNB"/>

The voyage to South Africa was made to catalogue the stars, [[nebula]]e, and other objects of the southern skies.<ref name=HersNAH/> This was to be a completion as well as extension of the survey of the northern heavens undertaken initially by his father [[William Herschel]]. He arrived in [[Cape Town]] on 15 January 1834 and set up a private {{convert|21|ft|m|abbr=on}} telescope at Feldhausen (site of present day [[Grove Primary School (South Africa)|Grove Primary School]]) at [[Claremont, Cape Town|Claremont]], a suburb of [[Cape Town]]. Amongst his other observations during this time was that of the return of [[Comet Halley]]. Herschel collaborated with [[Thomas Maclear]], the Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope and the members of the two families became close friends. During this time, he also witnessed the Great Eruption of [[Eta Carinae]] (December 1837).

In addition to his astronomical work, however, this voyage to a far corner of the [[British Empire|British empire]] also gave Herschel an escape from the pressures under which he found himself in London, where he was one of the most sought-after of all British men of science. While in [[southern Africa]], he engaged in a broad variety of scientific pursuits free from a sense of strong obligations to a larger scientific community. It was, he later recalled, probably the happiest time in his life.<ref>{{Cite web |title=John Herschel in South Africa |url=https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Herschel_South_Africa/ |access-date=2024-02-14 |website=Maths History |language=en}}</ref> A [[Herschel, South Africa|village]] in the contemporary province of [[Eastern Cape]] is named after him.

Herschel combined his talents with those of his wife, Margaret, and between 1834 and 1838 they produced 131 botanical illustrations of fine quality, showing the Cape flora. Herschel used a [[camera lucida]] to obtain accurate outlines of the specimens and left the details to his wife. Even though their portfolio had been intended as a personal record, and despite the lack of floral dissections in the paintings, their accurate rendition makes them more valuable than many contemporary collections. Some 112 of the 132 known flower studies were collected and published as ''Flora Herscheliana'' in 1996. The book also included work by [[Charles Davidson Bell]] and Thomas Bowler.<ref name=feld>{{Cite web |title=Flora Herscheliana: Sir John and Lady Herschel at the Cape: 1834 – 1838 |url=https://www.nhbs.com/flora-herscheliana-book |access-date=2023-01-27 |website=www.nhbs.com |language=en}}</ref>

As their home during their stay in the Cape, the Herschels had selected 'Feldhausen' ("Field Houses"),<ref name=feld/> an old estate on the south-eastern side of [[Table Mountain]]. Here John set up his reflector to begin his survey of the southern skies.

Herschel, at the same time, read widely. Intrigued by the ideas of gradual formation of landscapes set out in [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'', he wrote to Lyell on 20 February 1836 praising the book as a work that would bring "a complete revolution in [its] subject, by altering entirely the point of view in which it must thenceforward be contemplated" and opening a way for bold speculation on "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others." Herschel himself thought [[catastrophism|catastrophic extinction and renewal]] "an inadequate conception of the Creator" and by analogy with other [[Physical law|intermediate causes]], "the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".{{sfn|van Wyhe|2007|p=197}}{{sfn|Babbage|1838|pp=225–227}} He prefaced his words with the couplet:

{{poemquote|He that on such quest would go must know not fear or failing
To coward soul or faithless heart the search were unavailing.}}

Taking a gradualist view of development and referring to evolutionary descent from a [[proto-language]], Herschel commented:

{{blockquote|Words are to the Anthropologist what rolled pebbles are to the Geologist – battered relics of past ages often containing within them indelible records capable of intelligent interpretation – and when we see what amount of change 2000 years has been able to produce in the languages of Greece & Italy or 1000 in those of Germany France & Spain we naturally begin to ask how long a period must have lapsed since the Chinese, the Hebrew, the Delaware & the Malesass [Malagasy] had a point in common with the German & Italian & each other – Time! Time! Time! – we must not impugn the Scripture Chronology, but we ''must'' interpret it in accordance with ''whatever'' shall appear on fair enquiry to be the ''truth'' for there cannot be two truths. And really there is scope enough: for the lives of the Patriarchs may as reasonably be extended to 5000 or 50000 years apiece as the days of Creation to as many thousand millions of years.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=214–215}}{{sfn|Darwin|1985b|loc=[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-346.xml#mark-346.f5 Letter No. 346]}} }}

The document was circulated, and [[Charles Babbage]] incorporated extracts in his ninth and unofficial ''[[Bridgewater Treatise]]'', which postulated laws set up by a divine programmer.{{sfn|van Wyhe|2007|p=197}} When [[The Voyage of the Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] called at [[Cape Town]], Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]] and the young naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] visited Herschel on 3 June 1836. Later on, Darwin would be influenced by Herschel's writings in developing his theory advanced in ''[[The Origin of Species]]''. In the opening lines of that work, Darwin writes that his intent is "to throw some light on the origin of species – that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers," referring to Herschel.  However, Herschel ultimately rejected the theory of natural selection.<ref>John Herschel, ''Physical Geography'' (1861), p. 12.</ref>

Herschel returned to England in 1838, was created a [[Herschel baronets|baronet]], of Slough in the County of Buckingham,<ref name=HersNAH/> and published ''Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope'' in 1847. In this publication he proposed the names still used today for the seven then-known satellites of [[Saturn]]: [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], [[Enceladus]], [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]].{{sfn|Lassell|1848|p=}} In the same year, Herschel received his second Copley Medal from the Royal Society for this work.  A few years later, in 1852, he proposed the names still used today for the four then-known satellites of [[Uranus]]: [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], [[Umbriel]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]]. A stone obelisk, erected in 1842 and now in the grounds of [[Grove Primary School (South Africa)|The Grove Primary School]], marks the site where his 20-ft reflector once stood.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|title=The Herschel Obelisk in Cape Town|journal=The Observatory|year=2020|volume=140 |pages=262–264|bibcode=2020Obs...140..262R |url=https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2020Obs...140..262R}}</ref>

== Photography ==

Herschel made numerous important contributions to photography. He made improvements in [[photographic processes]], particularly in inventing the [[cyanotype]]<ref name="WDL1" /> process, which became known as [[blueprint]]s,<ref name="EncycBrit" /><ref name="columbia" /><ref name="vernacu"/> and variations, such as the [[chrysotype]]. In 1839, he made a photograph on glass, which still exists, and experimented with some colour reproduction, noting that rays of different parts of the spectrum tended to impart their own colour to a [[photographic paper]]. Herschel made experiments using [[photosensitive]] emulsions of vegetable juices, called phytotypes, also known as [[anthotype]]s, and published his discoveries in the Philosophical Transactions of the [[Royal Society]] of London in 1842.{{sfn|Herschel|1842|pp=182–214}}  He collaborated in the early 1840s with [[Henry Collen]], portrait painter to [[Queen Victoria]].  Herschel originally discovered the platinum process on the basis of the light sensitivity of platinum salts, later developed by [[William Willis (inventor)|William Willis]].<ref name= "KNAW" />

Herschel coined the term ''photography'' in 1839.{{sfn|Schaaf|1979|pp=47–60}}{{sfn|Peres|2008|p=}} Herschel was also the first to apply the terms ''negative'' and ''positive'' to photography.<ref name=HersNAH/>

Herschel discovered [[sodium thiosulfate]] to be a solvent of silver [[halide]]s in 1819,{{sfn|Herschel|1819|p=}} and informed [[Henry Fox Talbot|Talbot]] and [[Louis Daguerre|Daguerre]] of his discovery that this "hyposulphite of soda" ("hypo") could be used as a [[photographic fixer]], to "fix" pictures and make them permanent, after experimentally applying it thus in early 1839.

Herschel's ground-breaking research on the subject was read at the Royal Society in London in March 1839 and January 1840.

== Other aspects of Herschel's career ==
Herschel wrote many papers and articles, including entries on meteorology, physical geography and the telescope for the eighth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.<ref name=HersNAH/> He also translated the ''[[Iliad]]'' of Homer.
{{further|English translations of Homer#Herschel}}

In 1823, Herschel published his findings on the optical spectra of metal salts.{{sfn|Herschel|1823}}

Herschel invented the [[actinometer]] in 1825 to measure the direct heating power of the Sun's rays,{{sfn|Anon|1884|p=527}} and his work with the instrument is of great importance in the early history of [[photochemistry]].

[[File:Lunar Copernicus crater - Herschel 1842.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Calotype]] of a model of the lunar crater Copernicus, 1842. Photographs of the Moon's surface were not yet possible at the time]]

Herschel proposed a correction to the Gregorian calendar, making years that are multiples of 4000 [[common year]]s rather than [[leap year]]s, thus reducing the average length of the [[calendar year]] from 365.2425 days to 365.24225.{{sfn|Herschel|1876a|p=712}}{{failed verification|date=October 2024}} Although this is closer to the [[mean tropical year]] of 365.24219 days, his proposal has never been adopted because the [[Gregorian calendar]] is based on the mean time between vernal [[equinox]]es (currently {{gaps|365.242|374}} days).{{sfn|Steel|2000|p=185}}

Herschel was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1832,<ref name="AAAS" /> and in 1836, a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. 

In 1835, the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' newspaper wrote a series of satiric articles that came to be known as the [[Great Moon Hoax]], with statements falsely attributed to Herschel about his supposed discoveries of animals living on the Moon, including batlike winged humanoids.

Several locations are named for him: the village of [[Herschel, Saskatchewan|Herschel]] in western [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]], site of the discovery of  ''[[Dolichorhynchops herschelensis]]'', a type of [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaur]]; [[Mount Herschel]] in [[Antarctica]]; the crater [[J. Herschel (crater)|J. Herschel]] on [[the Moon]]; and the settlement of [[Herschel, Eastern Cape]] and the [[Herschel Girls' School]] in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.

While it is commonly accepted that Herschel Island, in the Arctic Ocean, part of the [[Yukon Territory]], was named after him, the entries in the expedition journal of Sir [[John Franklin]] state that the latter wished to honour the Herschel family, of which John Herschel's father, Sir [[William Herschel]], and his aunt, [[Caroline Herschel]], are as notable as John.{{sfn|Burn|2009|pp=317–323}}
