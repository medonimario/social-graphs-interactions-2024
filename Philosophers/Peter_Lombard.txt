==Biography==

===Early years===
Peter Lombard was born in [[Lumellogno]]<ref>Hödl, in ''Biografisch-Bibliografisches Kirchenlexikon''.</ref> (then a rural commune, now a ''quartiere'' of [[Novara]], [[Piedmont]]), in northwestern [[Italy]], to a poor family.<ref>The few known facts of Peter's life are presented in Philippe Delhaye, ''Pierre Lombard: sa vie, ses œuvres, sa morale'' (Paris/Montreal) 1961.</ref> His date of birth was likely between 1095 and 1100.<ref name="CEN" /><ref name="GFH" /><ref name="CDG" />

His education most likely began in Italy at the [[cathedral school]]s of [[Novara Cathedral|Novara]] and [[Lucca]] and at the [[University of Bologna]].<ref name="brit7">{{Cite journal |last=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |date=2 April 2024 |title=Peter Lombard |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Peter-Lombard |journal=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]}}</ref> The patronage of [[Odo of Lucca|Odo, bishop of Lucca]], who recommended him to [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], allowed him to leave Italy and further his studies at [[Reims]] and [[Paris]]. Lombard studied first in the [[cathedral school at Reims]], where Magister Alberich and Lutolph of Novara were teaching, and arrived in Paris about 1134,<ref>Hödl</ref> where Bernard recommended him<ref>In a surviving letter, Ep. 410, ''Opera omnia'' viii.391, noted by Hödl</ref> to the canons of the church of St. Victor.

===Professor===
In Paris, where he spent the next decade teaching at the cathedral school of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], he came into contact with [[Peter Abelard]] and [[Hugh of St. Victor]], who were among the leading theologians of the time. There are no proven facts relating to his whereabouts in Paris until 1142, when he became recognized as a teacher and writer.  Around 1145, Peter became a "magister", or professor, at the cathedral school of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris. Peter's means of earning a living before he began to derive income as a teacher and from his [[canon (priest)|canon]]'s [[prebend]] is shrouded in uncertainty.

Lombard's style of teaching gained quick acknowledgment. It can be surmised that this attention is what prompted the canons of Notre Dame to ask him to join their ranks. He was considered a ''celebrated theologian'' by 1144. The Parisian school of canons had not included among their number a theologian of high regard for some years. The canons of Notre Dame, to a man, were members of the [[Capetian dynasty]], relatives of families closely aligned to the Capetians by blood or marriage, scions of the [[Île-de-France]] or eastern [[Loire Valley]] nobility, or relatives of royal officials. In contrast, Peter had no relatives, ecclesiastical connections, and no political patrons in France. It seems that he must have been invited by the canons of Notre Dame solely for his academic merit.

===Priesthood and Bishop of Paris===
He became a [[subdeacon]] in 1147. Possibly he was present at the consistory of Paris in 1147, and certainly he attended the [[Council of Rheims (1148)|Council of Rheims]] in 1148, held in the presence of  [[Pope Eugenius III]] to examine [[Gilbert de la Porrée]] and [[Éon de l'Étoile]]. Peter was among the signatories of the act condemning Gilbert's teachings.<ref>Hödl.</ref> At some time after 1150 Peter became a [[deacon]], then  [[archdeacon]], maybe as early as 1152. He was ordained priest some time before 1156. On 28 July 1159, on the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]], he was [[consecration|consecrated]] [[bishop of Paris]]. [[Walter of St Victor]] accused Peter of obtaining the office by [[simony]].<ref>In his polemic ''Contra quatuor labyrinthos Franciae'' II.4.</ref> The more usual story is that Philip, younger brother of [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] and archdeacon of Notre-Dame, was elected by the canons but declined in favor of Peter Lombard, his teacher.

Lombard's time as bishop was brief.<ref>His successor, Maurice de Sully, was bishop by the end of 1160.</ref> Lombard died on either 21 or 22 August 1160 in Paris.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019 |title=Peter Lombard |url=https://www.nndb.com/people/775/000094493/ |access-date=17 May 2024 |website=NNDB}}</ref><ref name=brit7/> As to his administrative style or objectives little can be ascertained, since he left behind so few episcopal ''acta''. He was succeeded by [[Maurice de Sully]], the builder of the [[Cathedral of Notre Dame]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Peter Lombard}}</ref> Lombard's tomb in the church of Saint-Marcel in Paris was destroyed during the [[French Revolution]], but a transcription of his epitaph survives.

==Writings==
[[File:Bologna, pietro lombardo, sententiae, 1280 ca., pluteo 25 dex 1.jpg|thumb|300px|''Sententiae'', 1280 circa, [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]], Florence]]
Peter Lombard wrote commentaries on the Psalms and the Pauline epistles; however, his most famous work by far was ''Libri Quatuor Sententiarum'', or the ''[[Sentences|Four Books of Sentences]]'', which became the standard textbook of theology at the medieval universities.<ref>{{cite book |title=Scholasticism|url=https://archive.org/details/Scholasticism|author=Joseph Rickaby|year=1908|publisher=A. Constable|page=23}}</ref> From the 1220s until the 16th century, no work of Christian literature, except for the [[Bible]] itself, was commented upon more frequently. Even [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]],'' written around 1270, would not eclipse the ''Sentences'' in importance until around the 16th century. All the major medieval thinkers in western Europe, from [[Albert the Great]] and Thomas Aquinas to [[William of Ockham]] and [[Gabriel Biel]], were influenced by it. Even the young [[Martin Luther]] still wrote glosses on the ''Sentences'', and [[John Calvin]] quoted from it over 100 times in his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion|Institutes]]''.

The ''Four Books of Sentences'' formed the framework upon which four centuries of scholastic interpretation of Western Christian dogma was based; however, rather than being a dialectical work itself, the ''Four Books of Sentences'' is a compilation of biblical texts, together with relevant passages from the [[Church Fathers]] and many medieval thinkers. It covered virtually the entire field of Christian theology as it was understood at the time. Peter Lombard's ''magnum opus'' stands squarely within the pre-scholastic [[exegesis]] of biblical passages, in the tradition of [[Anselm of Laon]] who taught through quotations from authorities.<ref>This is a central point of Delhaye 1961, who sees Abelard, rather than Peter, as the founder of [[scholasticism]].</ref> It stands out as the first major effort to bring together commentaries on the full range of theological issues, arrange the material in a systematic order, and attempt to reconcile them where they appeared to defend different viewpoints. The ''Sentences'' starts with the [[Trinity]] in Book I, moves on to [[Creation myth|creation]] in Book II, treats [[Christ]], the saviour of the fallen creation, in Book III, and deals with the [[sacraments]], which mediate Christ's grace, in Book IV.

==Doctrine==
Peter Lombard's most famous and most controversial doctrine in the ''Sentences'' was his identification of [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] with the [[Holy Spirit]] in Book I, distinction 17. According to this doctrine, when the Christian loves God and his neighbour, this love literally is God; he becomes divine and is taken up into the life of the Trinity. This idea, in its inchoate form, can be extrapolated from certain remarks of [[Augustine of Hippo]] (cf. De Trinitate 13.7.11). Although this was never explicitly declared unorthodox, few theologians have been prepared to follow Peter Lombard in this aspect of his teaching. The Council of Trent however, may have condemned this view in an implicit manner, with ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' noting that: <blockquote>According to the Council of Trent sanctifying grace is not merely ''a'' formal cause, but "''the only'' formal cause" (''unica causa formalis'') of our justification. By this important decision the Council excluded the error of Butzer and some Catholic theologians (Gropper, Seripando, and Albert Pighius) who maintained that an additional "external favour of God" (''favor Dei externus'') belonged to the essence of justification. The same decree also effectually set aside the opinion of Peter Lombard, that the formal cause of justification (i.e. sanctifying grace) is nothing less than the ''Person'' of the Holy Ghost, Who is the hypostatic holiness and charity, or the uncreated grace (''gratia increata''). Since justification consists in an interior sanctity and renovation of spirit, its formal cause evidently must be a created grace (''gratia creata''), a permanent quality, a supernatural modification or accident (''accidens'') of the soul.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Justification |url=https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08573a.htm#:~:text=Considered%20as%20an%20act%20(actus%20justificationis),%20justification%20is%20the%20work#:~:text=Considered%20as%20an%20act%20(actus%20justificationis),%20justification%20is%20the%20work |access-date=2024-10-06 |website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref></blockquote>Also in the ''Sentences'' was the doctrine that [[marriage]] was consensual and need not be consummated to be considered perfect, unlike [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s analysis (see ''[[sponsalia de futuro]]''). Lombard's interpretation was later endorsed by [[Pope Alexander III]], and had a significant impact on Church interpretation of marriage.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1163/ej.9789004118614.i-551.6 |chapter=The Pseudo-Peter of Poitiers Gloss |title=Mediaeval Commentaries on the ''Sentences'' of Peter Lombard |year=2010 |pages=1–33 |isbn=978-90-04-11861-4 |first1=Marcia L. |last1=Colish |author-link=Marcia Colish |editor1-first=Philipp |editor1-last=Rosemann }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Donahue |first1=Charles |title=The Canon Law On the Formation of Marriage and Social Practice in the Later Middle Ages |journal=Journal of Family History |date=June 1983 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=144–158 |id={{ProQuest|1300086562}} |doi=10.1177/036319908300800204 |s2cid=144042143 }}</ref> He emphasized that reciprocal consent of the parties is sufficiently constitutive of an absolutely indissoluble marriage, and is its only cause independent of sexual intercourse.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kamas|first=Juraj|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FS-kaB37VisC&q=He+emphasized+the+reciprocal+consent+of+the+parties+is+sufficiently&pg=PA98|title=The Separation of the Spouses with the Bond Remaining: Historical and Canonical Study with Pastoral Applications|date=1997|publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop|isbn=978-88-7652-757-9|language=en}}</ref>
