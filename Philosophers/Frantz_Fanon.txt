In the course of his work as a [[physician]] and psychiatrist, Fanon supported the [[Algerian War]] of independence from France and was a member of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Algerian National Liberation Front]]. Fanon has been described as "the most influential anticolonial thinker of his time".<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Jansen|first1=Jan C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AhpDQAAQBAJ|title=Decolonization: A Short History|last2=Osterhammel|first2=Jürgen|date=2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8488-9|pages=165|language=en}}</ref> For more than five decades, the life and works of Fanon have inspired [[national liberation movements]] and other freedom and political movements in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Sri Lanka]], South Africa, and the United States.<ref name=AliceCherki>Alice Cherki, ''Frantz Fanon.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===

Frantz Omar Fanon was born on 20 July 1925 in [[Fort-de-France]], [[Martinique]], which was then part of the [[French colonial empire]]. His father, Félix Casimir Fanon, worked as a [[customs officer]], while Fanon's mother, Eléanore Médélice, who was of [[Afro-Caribbean people|Afro-Caribbean]] and [[French people|French descent]], was a shopkeeper.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfwJCAAAQBAJ |title=What Fanon Said: A Philosophical Introduction to His Life and Thought |last1=Gordon |first1=Lewis R. |last2=Cornell |first2=Drucilla |date=1 January 2015 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823266081 |page=26 |language=en}}</ref> Fanon was the third of four sons in a family of eight children. Two of his siblings died young, including Fanon's sister Gabrielle, with whom he was very close. As they were [[middle class]], his family could afford to send Fanon to the [[Lycée Victor Schœlcher]], the most prestigious [[secondary school]] in Martinique, where Fanon came to admire one of his teachers, [[Aimé Césaire]].<ref name=EhlenBiog>Patrick Ehlen, ''Frantz Fanon: A Spiritual Biography'' (2001), New York: Crossroad 8th Avenue.</ref>

=== World War II ===

After the [[Battle of France]] resulted in the [[French Third Republic]] capitulating to [[Nazi Germany]] in July 1940, Martinique came under the control of [[French Navy]] elements led by Admiral [[Georges Robert (admiral)|Georges Robert]] who were loyal to the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]]. The disruption of imports from [[Metropolitan France]] led to major shortages on the island, which were exacerbated by a naval [[blockade]] imposed by the [[United States]] on Martinique in April 1943. Robert's authoritarian regime repressed local [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] sympathizers, hundreds of whom escaped to nearby [[Caribbean]] islands. Fanon later described the Vichy regime in Martinique as taking off their masks and behaving like "authentic racists".<ref>David Macey, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v058/58.1macey.html "Frantz Fanon, or the Difficulty of Being Martinican"], ''History Workshop Journal'', Project Muse. Retrieved 27 August 2010.</ref> In January 1943, he fled Martinique during the wedding of one of his brothers and travelled to the [[British Empire|British colony]] of [[Dominica]] in order to link up with other Allied sympathizers.<ref name=zellig>{{cite book |last1=Zeilig |first1=Leo |title=Frantz Fanon: A Political Biography |date=2021 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=9780755638239 |edition=First |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PyUhEAAAQBAJ}}</ref>{{rp|24}} 

After he arrived at Dominica, Robert's regime was deposed by an indigenous uprising in June 1943, which Fanon would later acclaim as "the birth of the [Martinican] [[proletariat]]" as a revolutionary force. After the uprising, [[Charles de Gaulle]] appointed [[Henri Tourtet]] as the governor of Martinique, and he raised the [[5th Antillean Marching Battalion]] to serve in [[French Liberation Army|Free French Forces]] (FFL). Fanon "enthusiastically" returned to Martinique and joined the unit in Fort-de-France.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Macey |first1=David |title=Frantz Fanon 1925-1961 |journal=History of Psychiatry |date=December 1996 |volume=7 |issue=28 |pages=489–497 |doi=10.1177/0957154X9600702802 |pmid=11618750 |citeseerx=10.1.1.858.188 |s2cid=45834503 }}</ref><ref>Nicholls, Tracey. ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/fanon/#H1</ref> He underwent basic training before boarding a [[troopship]] bound for [[Casablanca]], [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] in March 1944. After Fanon arrived in Morocco, he was shocked to discover the extent of [[racial discrimination]] in the FFL. He was subsequently transferred to a Free French military base in [[Béjaïa]], [[French Algeria|Algeria]], where Fanon witnessed firsthand the [[antisemitism]] and [[Islamophobia]] of the ''[[pieds-noirs]]'', many of whom had supported racist laws promulgated by the Vichy regime.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Algerian Revolution Changed the World for the Better |url=https://jacobin.com/2021/04/algerian-revolution-france-colonialism |access-date=2024-08-18 |website=jacobin.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

In August 1944, he departed on another troopship from [[Oran]] to France as part of [[Operation Dragoon]], the Allied invasion of German-occupied [[Provence]]. After the US [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] secured a [[beachhead]], Fanon's unit came ashore at [[Saint-Tropez]] and advanced inland. He participated in several engagements near [[Montbéliard]], [[Doubs]] and was seriously wounded by shrapnel, which resulted in him being hospitalized for two months. Fanon was awarded a ''[[Croix de Guerre 1939–1945|Croix de Guerre]]'' by Colonel [[Raoul Salan]] for his actions during the engagements, and in early 1945 rejoined his unit and fought in the [[Battle of Alsace]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Macey|first=David|date=December 1996|title=Frantz Fanon 1925-1961|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0957154X9600702802|journal=History of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=7|issue=28|page=490|doi=10.1177/0957154X9600702802|pmid=11618750|s2cid=45834503|issn=0957-154X}}</ref> After German forces had been pushed out of France and Allied troops crossed the [[Rhine]] into Germany, Fanon and his fellow Black troops were removed from their formations and sent southwards to [[Toulon]] as part of de Gaulle's policy of removing non-white soldiers from the French army.<ref name=MaceyBiog /> He was subsequently transferred to [[Normandy]] to await [[repatriation]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fanon |first=Frantz |date=14 November 2011 |title=Franz Fanon, Writer born |url=https://aaregistry.org/story/franz-fanon-writer-born/ |access-date=15 May 2022 |website=African American Registry |language=en}}</ref>

Although Fanon had been initially eager to participate in the Allied war effort, the racism he witnessed during the war disillusioned him. Fanon wrote to his brother Joby from Europe that "I've been deceived, and I am paying for my mistakes&nbsp;... I'm sick of it all."<ref name=":0" /> In the fall of 1945, a newly-discharged Fanon returned to Martinique, where he focused on completing his secondary education. He also worked for the political campaign of Césaire, by now a friend and mentor of his. Césaire ran on the [[French Communist Party]] ticket as a delegate from Martinique to the first [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] of the [[French Fourth Republic]]. Fanon stayed in Martininque long enough to complete his ''[[baccalauréat]]'' and then went to Metropolitan France, where he studied medicine and psychiatry.{{fact|date=July 2024}}

===France===

Fanon was educated in [[Lyon]], where he also studied literature, drama and philosophy, sometimes attending [[Merleau-Ponty]]'s lectures. During this period, he wrote three plays, of which two survive.<ref>Fanon, Frantz (2015). [http://www.editionsladecouverte.fr/catalogue/index-_crits_sur_l_alienation_et_la_liberte-9782707188717.html ''Écrits sur l'aliénation et la liberté''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113140322/http://www.editionsladecouverte.fr/catalogue/index-_crits_sur_l_alienation_et_la_liberte-9782707188717.html |date=13 January 2017 }}. Éditions La Découverte, Paris. {{ISBN|978-2-7071-8871-7}}</ref> After qualifying as a [[psychiatrist]] in 1951, Fanon did a residency in psychiatry at [[Saint-Alban-sur-Limagnole]] under the radical [[Catalan people|Catalan]] psychiatrist [[François Tosquelles]], who invigorated Fanon's thinking by emphasizing the role of culture in psychopathology.

In 1948, Fanon started a relationship with Michèle Weyer, a medical student, who soon became pregnant. He left her for an 18-year-old high school student, Josie, whom he married in 1952. At urging of his friends he later recognized his daughter, [[Mireille Fanon Mendès-France|Mireille]], although he did not have contact with her.<ref>Zeilig, L. (2016) ''Frantz Fanon, Militant Philosopher of Third World Liberation.'' I.B.Tauris & Co. Ltd. p 31</ref>

In France while completing his residency, Fanon wrote and published his first book, ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'' (1952), an analysis of the negative psychological effects of [[Colonialism|colonial]] subjugation upon black people. Originally, the manuscript was the [[Thesis|doctoral dissertation]], submitted at Lyon, entitled "Essay on the Disalienation of the Black", which was a response to the racism that Fanon experienced while studying psychiatry and medicine at university in Lyon; the rejection of the dissertation prompted Fanon to publish it as a book. For his doctor of philosophy degree, he submitted another dissertation of narrower scope and different subject. [[Left-wing]] philosopher [[Francis Jeanson]], leader of the pro-Algerian independence [[Jeanson network]], read Fanon's manuscript and as a senior book editor at [[Éditions du Seuil]] in Paris, gave the book its new title and wrote its epilogue.<ref name=ACherki>{{cite book |last=Cherki|first=Alice|title=Frantz Fanon: A Portrait|url=https://archive.org/details/frantzfanonportr00cher|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-7308-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/frantzfanonportr00cher/page/24 24]}}</ref>

After receiving Fanon's manuscript at Seuil, Jeanson invited him to an editorial meeting. Amid Jeanson's praise of the book, Fanon exclaimed: "Not bad for a nigger, is it?" Insulted, Jeanson dismissed Fanon from his office. Later, Jeanson learned that his response had earned him the writer's lifelong respect, and Fanon acceded to Jeanson's suggestion that the book be entitled ''Black Skin, White Masks''.<ref name=ACherki/>

In the book, Fanon described the unfair treatment of black people in France and how they were disapproved of by [[white people]]. Black people also had a sense of inferiority when facing white people. Fanon believed that even though they could speak French, they could not fully integrate into the life and environment of white people. (See further discussion of ''Black Skin, White Masks'' under Work, below.)

===Algeria===

After his residency, Fanon practised psychiatry at [[Pontorson]], near [[Mont Saint-Michel]], for another year and then (from 1953) in [[Algeria]]. He was ''chef de service'' at the [[Blida|Blida-Joinville]] Psychiatric Hospital in Algeria. He worked there until his deportation in January 1957.<ref name="Cherki">Cherki, Alice (2000), ''Frantz Fanon. Portrait'', Paris: Seuil; Macey, David (2000), ''Frantz Fanon: A Biography'', New York: Picador Press.</ref>

Fanon's methods of treatment started evolving, particularly by beginning [[Sociotherapy|socio-therapy]] to connect with his patients' [[Culture|cultural backgrounds]]. He also trained nurses and interns. Following the outbreak of the [[Algerian War|Algerian revolution]] in November 1954, Fanon joined the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]], after having made contact with [[Pierre Chaulet]] at [[Blida]] in 1955. Working at a French hospital in Algeria, Fanon became responsible for treating the psychological distress of the French soldiers and officers who carried out torture in order to suppress anti-colonial resistance. Additionally, Fanon was also responsible for treating Algerian [[torture]] victims.

Fanon made extensive trips across Algeria, mainly in the [[Kabylia]] region, to study the cultural and psychological life of Algerians. His lost study of "The [[marabout]] of Si Slimane" is an example. These trips were also a means for clandestine activities, notably in his visits to the ski resort of [[Chrea]] which hid an [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] base.

===Joining the FLN and exile from Algeria===

By summer 1956, Fanon realized that he could no longer continue to support French efforts, even indirectly via his hospital work. In November he submitted his "Letter of resignation to the Resident Minister", which later became an influential text of its own in [[anti-colonialist]] circles.<ref name="Azar00">{{cite journal |last1=Azar |first1=Michael |title=In the Name of Algeria: Frantz Fanon and the Algerian Revolution |journal=Eurozine |date=6 December 2000 |url=https://www.eurozine.com/in-the-name-of-algeria/ |access-date=30 December 2020}}</ref>

<blockquote>
There comes a time when silence becomes dishonesty. The ruling intentions of personal existence are not in accord with the permanent assaults on the most commonplace values. For many months my conscience has been the seat of unpardonable debates. And the conclusion is the determination not to despair of man, in other words, of myself. The decision I have reached is that I cannot continue to bear a responsibility at no matter what cost, on the false pretext that there is nothing else to be done.
</blockquote>

Shortly afterwards, Fanon was expelled from Algeria and moved to [[Tunis]], where he joined the FLN openly. He was part of the editorial collective of ''[[Al Moudjahid]]'', for which he wrote until the end of his life. He also served as [[Ambassador]] to [[Ghana]] for the Provisional Algerian Government ([[Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic|GPRA]]). He attended conferences in [[Accra]], [[Conakry]], [[Addis Ababa]], [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]], [[Cairo]] and [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]]. Many of his shorter writings from this period were collected posthumously in the book ''[[Toward the African Revolution]]''. In this book Fanon reveals war tactical strategies; in one chapter he discusses how to open a southern front to the war and how to run the supply lines.<ref name="Cherki"/>

Upon his return to [[Tunis]], after his exhausting trip across the [[Sahara]] to open a Third Front, Fanon was diagnosed with [[leukemia]]. He went to the [[Soviet Union]] for treatment and experienced [[Cure|remission]] of his illness. When he came back to Tunis once again, he dictated his testament ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]''. When he was not confined to his bed, he delivered lectures to [[Armée de Libération Nationale]] (ALN) officers at [[Ghardimaou|Ghardimao]] on the Algerian–Tunisian border. He traveled to [[Rome]] for a three-day meeting with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who had greatly influenced his work. Sartre agreed to write a preface to Fanon's last book, ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Massey |first1=David |title=Frantz Fanon: A Biography |date=2000 |publisher=Picador}}</ref>

===Death and aftermath===

With his health declining, Fanon's comrades urged him to seek treatment in the [[United States|U.S.]] as his Soviet doctors had suggested.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book |last=Lewis |first=Gordon R. |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVUYDAAAQBAJ&dq=fanon+death+pneumonia+living+fanon&pg=PA25 |title=Living Fanon: Global Perspectives |date=2016-04-30 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-230-11999-4 |editor-last=Gibson |editor-first=Nigel C. |pages=25 |language=en |chapter=Requiem on a Life Well Lived: In Memory of Fanon}}</ref> In 1961, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] arranged a trip under the promise of stealth for further leukemia treatment at a [[National Institutes of Health]] facility.<ref name=":8" /><ref>Codevilla, Angelo, ''Informing Statecraft'' (1992, New York).</ref> During his time in the United States, Fanon was handled by CIA agent Oliver Iselin.<ref>Meaney, Thomas (2019), "Frantz Fanon and the CIA Man", ''The American Historical Review'' '''124'''(3): 983–995.</ref> As Lewis R.

==Work==
=== ''Black Skin, White Masks'' ===

''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'' was first published in French as ''Peau noire, masques blancs'' in 1952 and is one of Fanon's most important works. In ''Black Skin, White Masks,'' Fanon psychoanalyzes the oppressed Black person who is perceived to have to be a lesser creature in the White world that they live in, and studies how they navigate the world through a performance of [[Whiteness studies|Whiteness]].<ref name=":0" /> Particularly in discussing language, he talks about how the black person's use of a colonizer's language is seen by the colonizer as predatory, and not transformative, which in turn may create insecurity in the black's consciousness.<ref name=":1" /> He recounts that he himself faced many admonitions as a child for using [[Creole language|Creole French]] instead of "real French", or "French French", that is, "white" French.<ref name=":0" /> Ultimately, he concludes that "mastery of language [of the white/colonizer] for the sake of recognition ''as white'' reflects a dependency that subordinates the black's humanity".<ref name=":1" />

The reception of his work has been affected by English translations which are recognized to contain numerous omissions and errors, while his unpublished work, including his doctoral thesis, has received little attention. As a result, it has been argued Fanon has often been portrayed as an advocate of violence (it would be more accurate to characterize him as a dialectical opponent of nonviolence) and that his ideas have been extremely oversimplified. This reductionist vision of Fanon's work ignores the subtlety of his understanding of the colonial system. For example, the fifth chapter of ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'' translates, literally, as "The Lived Experience of the Black" ("L'expérience vécue du Noir"), but Markmann's translation is "The Fact of Blackness", which leaves out the massive influence of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] on Fanon's early work.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Moten|first=Fred|title=The Case of Blackness|journal=Criticism|date=Spring 2008|volume=50|issue=2|pages=177–218|doi=10.1353/crt.0.0062|s2cid=154145525 }}</ref>

Although Fanon wrote ''Black Skin, White Masks'' while still in France, most of his work was written in [[North Africa]]. It was during this time that he produced works such as ''L'An Cinq, de la Révolution Algérienne'' in 1959 (''Year Five of the Algerian Revolution''), later republished as ''Sociology of a Revolution'' and later still as ''[[A Dying Colonialism]]''. Fanon's original title was "Reality of a Nation"; however the publisher, [[François Maspero]], refused to accept this title.

Fanon's three books were supplemented by numerous psychiatry articles as well as radical critiques of French colonialism in journals such as ''Esprit'' and [[El Moudjahid]].

=== ''A Dying Colonialism'' ===

''[[A Dying Colonialism]]'' is a 1959 book by Fanon that provides an account of how, during the Algerian Revolution, the people of Algeria fought their oppressors. They changed centuries-old cultural patterns and embraced certain ancient cultural practices long derided by their colonialist oppressors as “primitive,” in order to destroy the oppressors. Fanon uses the fifth year of the Algerian Revolution as a point of departure for an explication of the inevitable dynamics of colonial oppression. The militant book describes Fanon's understanding that for the colonized, “having a gun is the only chance you still have of giving a meaning to your death.”<ref>Summary of "A Dying Colonialism" by Publisher Grove Atlantic. Viewed on 15 January 2019. [https://groveatlantic.com/book/a-dying-colonialism/].</ref> It also contains one of his most influential articles, "Unveiled Algeria", that signifies the fall of imperialism and describes how oppressed people struggle to decolonize their "mind" to avoid assimilation.

=== ''The Wretched of the Earth'' ===

In ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' (1961, ''Les damnés de la terre''), published shortly before Fanon's death, Fanon defends the right of a colonized people to use violence to gain independence. In addition, he delineated the processes and forces leading to national independence or neocolonialism during the decolonization movement that engulfed much of the world after [[World War II]]. In defence of the use of violence by colonized peoples, Fanon argued that human beings who are not considered as such (by the colonizer) shall not be bound by principles that apply to humanity in their attitude towards the colonizer. His book was [[Censorship in France|censored]] by the French government.

For Fanon in ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'', the colonizer's presence in Algeria is based on sheer military strength. Any resistance to this strength must also be of a violent nature because it is the only "language" the colonizer speaks. Thus, violent resistance is a necessity imposed by the colonists upon the colonized. The relevance of language and the reformation of discourse pervades much of his work, which is why it is so interdisciplinary, spanning psychiatric concerns to encompass politics, sociology, anthropology, linguistics and literature.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fanon |first=Frantz |date=1961 |title=Frantz Fanon {{!}} Biography, Writings, & Facts {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frantz-Fanon |access-date=15 May 2022 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

His participation in the Algerian [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]] from 1955 determined his audience as the Algerian colonized. It was to them that his final work, ''Les damnés de la terre'' (translated into English by Constance Farrington as ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'') was directed. It constitutes a warning to the oppressed of the dangers they face in the whirlwind of decolonization and the transition to a [[Neocolonialism|neo-colonialist]], [[Globalization|globalized]] world.<ref>"Two centuries ago, a former European colony decided to catch up with Europe. It succeeded so well that the United States of America became a monster, in which the taints, the sickness and the inhumanity of Europe have grown to appalling dimensions.

Comrades, have we not other work to do than to create a third Europe? [...] It is a question of the Third World starting a new history of Man, a history which will have regard to the sometimes prodigious theses which Europe has put forward, but which will also not forget Europe's crimes, of which the most horrible was committed in the heart of man, and consisted of the pathological tearing apart of his functions and the crumbling away of his unity. And in the framework of the collectivity there were the differentiations, the stratification and the bloodthirsty tensions fed by classes; and finally, on the immense scale of humanity, there were racial hatreds, slavery, exploitation and above all the bloodless genocide which consisted in the setting aside of fifteen thousand millions of men.
So, comrades, let us not pay tribute to Europe by creating states, institutions and societies which draw their inspiration from her."
''The Wretched of the Earth'' – [http://marxists.org/subject/africa/fanon/conclusion.htm "Conclusions"].</ref>

An often overlooked aspect of Fanon's work is that he did not like to physically write his pieces. Instead, he would dictate to his wife, Josie, who did all of the writing and, in some cases, contributed and edited.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=What Fanon Said|last=Gordon|first=Lewis|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2015|location=New York}}</ref>

==Influences==
Fanon was influenced by a variety of thinkers and [[School of thought|intellectual traditions]] including [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Négritude]], and [[Marxism]].<ref name=AliceCherki />

[[Aimé Césaire]] was a particularly significant influence in Fanon's life. Césaire, a leader of the ''[[Négritude]]'' movement, was teacher and [[Mentorship|mentor]] to Fanon on the island of Martinique.<ref>''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', second edition, 2010, p. 1438.</ref> Fanon was first introduced to ''Négritude'' during his lycée days in Martinique when Césaire coined the term and presented his ideas in ''[[Tropiques]]'', the journal that he edited with Suzanne Césaire, his wife, in addition to his now classic ''[[Cahier d'un retour au pays natal]] '' (Journal of a Homecoming).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfwJCAAAQBAJ|title=What Fanon Said: A Philosophical Introduction to His Life and Thought|last1=Gordon|first1=Lewis R.|last2=Cornell|first2=Drucilla|date=1 January 2015|publisher=Fordham University Press|isbn=9780823266081|language=en}}</ref> Fanon referred to Césaire's writings in his own work. He quoted, for example, his teacher at length in "The Lived Experience of the Black Man", a heavily [[Anthology|anthologized]] essay from ''Black Skins, White Masks''.<ref>[[Imre Szeman|Szeman, Imre]], and Timothy Kaposy (eds), ''Cultural Theory: An Anthology'', 2011, Wiley-Blackwell, p. 431.</ref>

==Legacy==
Fanon has had an influence on anti-colonial and [[national liberation movements]]. In particular, ''Les damnés de la terre'' was a major influence on the work of revolutionary leaders such as [[Ali Shariati]] in Iran, [[Steve Biko]] in South Africa, [[Malcolm X]] in the United States and [[Ernesto Che Guevara]] in [[Cuba]]. Of these, only Guevara was primarily concerned with Fanon's theories on violence;<ref>{{Cite web|title="Black Skin White Mask" Documentary About Revolutionary Frantz Fanon|url=https://originalpeople.org/black-skin-white-mask-documentary-revolutionary-frantz-fanon/|date=5 October 2013|website=Originalpeople.org|language=en-US|access-date=27 May 2020|archive-date=20 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020033109/https://originalpeople.org/black-skin-white-mask-documentary-revolutionary-frantz-fanon/|url-status=dead}}</ref> for Shariati and Biko the main interest in Fanon was "the new man" and "[[Black Consciousness Movement|black consciousness]]" respectively.<ref>[[Lewis Gordon|Lewis R. Gordon]], T. Denean Sharpley-Whiting, & Renee T. White (eds), ''Fanon: A Critical Reader'' (1996: Oxford: Blackwell), p. 163, and Bianchi, Eugene C., ''The Religious Experience of Revolutionaries'' (1972: Doubleday), p. 206.</ref>

With regard to the American liberation struggle more commonly known as [[Black Power movement|The Black Power Movement]], Fanon's work was especially influential. His book ''Wretched of the Earth'' is quoted directly in the preface of [[Stokely Carmichael]] (Kwame Ture) and [[Charles V. Hamilton|Charles Hamilton]]'s book, ''[[Black Power: The Politics of Liberation]]''<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Black power : the politics of liberation in America|author=Carmichael, Stokely|date=1992|publisher=Vintage Books|others=Hamilton, Charles V.|isbn=978-0679743132|edition=Vintage|location=New York|oclc=26096713|url=https://archive.org/details/blackpowerpoliti00carm_0}}</ref> which was published in 1967, shortly after Carmichael left the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). In addition, Carmichael and Hamilton include much of Fanon's theory on [[Colonialism]] in their work, beginning by framing the situation of former slaves in America as a colony situated inside a nation. "To put it another way, there is no "American dilemma" because black people in this country form a colony, and it is not in the interest of the colonial power to liberate them" (Ture Hamilton, 5).<ref name=":3" /> Another example is the indictment of the black middle class or what Fanon called the "colonized intellectual" as the indoctrinated followers of the colonial power. Fanon states, "The native intellectual has clothed his aggressiveness in his barely veiled desire to assimilate himself to the colonial world" (47).<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Fanon, Frantz |title=The wretched of the earth |date=1983 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780140224542 |location=Harmondsworth |oclc=12480619}}</ref> A third example is the idea that the natives (African Americans) should be constructing new social systems rather than participating in the systems created by the settler population. Ture and Hamilton contend that "black people should create rather than imitate" (144).<ref name=":3" />

The Black Power group that Fanon had the most influence on was the [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP). In 1970 [[Bobby Seale]], the Chairman of the BPP, published a collection of recorded observations made while he was incarcerated entitled ''[[Seize The Time: The Story of The Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton|Seize the Time: The Story of the Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton]]''.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=Seize the time : the story of the Black Panther party and Huey P.

While describing one of his first meetings with [[Huey P. Newton]], Seale describes bringing him a copy of ''Wretched of the Earth''. There are at least three other direct references to the book, all of them mentioning ways in which the book was influential and how it was included in the curriculum required of all new BPP members. Beyond just reading the text, Seale and the BPP included much of the work in their party platform. The Panther 10 Point Plan contained six points which either directly or indirectly referenced ideas in Fanon's work; these six points included their contention that there must be an end to the "robbery by the white man", and "education that teaches us our true history and our role in present day society" (67).<ref name=":4" /> One of the most important elements adopted by the BPP was the need to build the "humanity" of the native. Fanon claimed that the realization by the native that s/he was human would mark the beginning of the push for freedom (33).<ref name=":2" /> The BPP embraced this idea through the work of their Community Schools and [[Free Breakfast for Children|Free Breakfast Programs]].

Bolivian indianist [[Fausto Reinaga]] also had some Fanon influence and he mentions ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' in his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''La Revolución India'', advocating for decolonisation of native [[South America]]ns from European influence. In 2015, [[Raúl Zibechi]] argued that Fanon had become a key figure for the [[Latin America]]n [[Left-wing politics|left]].<ref>[http://compamanuel.com/2015/09/19/zibechi-red-hot-interest-in-fanon/ Red-hot interest in Fanon], Raul Zibechi, 2015</ref> In August 2021 Fanon's book ''Voices of liberation'' was one of those brought by [[Elisa Loncón]] to the new "plurinational library" of the [[Constitutional Convention (Chile)|Constitutional Convention of Chile]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Los libros que mostró Elisa Loncon en la Convención y que apuntan a una "biblioteca plurinacional"|url=https://www.latercera.com/culto/2021/08/03/los-libros-que-mostro-elisa-loncon-en-la-convencion-y-que-apuntan-a-una-biblioteca-plurinacional/|last=Retamal N.|first=Pablo|date=3 August 2021|access-date=10 August 2021|work=[[La Tercera]]|language=Spanish}}</ref>

Fanon's influence extended to the liberation movements of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]], the [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s, [[African American]]s and others. His work was a key influence on the [[Black Panther Party]], particularly his ideas concerning [[nationalism]], violence and the [[lumpenproletariat]]. More recently, radical South African poor people's movements, such as [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] (meaning 'people who live in shacks' in [[Zulu language|Zulu]]), have been influenced by Fanon's work.<ref>Gibson, Nigel C. (November 2008), [http://abahlali.org/files/uprightandfree.pdf "Upright and free: Fanon in South Africa, from Biko to the shackdwellers' movement (Abahlali baseMjondolo)]", ''Social Identities'', 14:6, pp. 683–715.</ref> His work was a key influence on Brazilian educationist [[Paulo Freire]], as well.

Fanon has also profoundly affected contemporary African literature. His work serves as an important theoretical gloss for writers including Ghana's [[Ayi Kwei Armah]], Senegal's [[Ken Bugul]] and [[Ousmane Sembène]], [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[Tsitsi Dangarembga]], and [[Kenya]]'s [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]]. Ngũgĩ goes so far to argue in ''[[Decolonising the Mind|Decolonizing the Mind]]'' (1992) that it is "impossible to understand what informs African writing" without reading Fanon's ''Wretched of the Earth''.<ref>Vincent B.

The [[Caribbean Philosophical Association]] offers the Frantz Fanon Prize for work that furthers the decolonization and liberation of mankind.<ref>[http://www.enriquedussel.org/agenda_en.html] [[Enrique Dussel]] website {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417010258/http://www.enriquedussel.org/agenda_en.html|date=17 April 2010}}</ref>

Fanon's writings on black sexuality in ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'' have garnered critical attention by a number of academics and [[queer theory]] scholars. Interrogating Fanon's perspective on the nature of black homosexuality and masculinity, queer theory academics have offered a variety of critical responses to Fanon's words, balancing his position within [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial studies]] with his influence on the formation of contemporary black [[queer theory]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alessandrini|first1=Anthony C.|title=Frantz Fanon: Critical Perspectives|date=1999|publisher=Routledge}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Pellegrini|first1=Ann|title=Performance Anxieties: Staging Psychoanalysis, Staging Race|url=https://archive.org/details/performanceanxie0000pell|url-access=registration|date=1997|publisher=Routledge}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Stecopoulos|first1=Harry|title=Race and the Subject of Masculinities|date=1997|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=31–38|chapter=Fanon: Race and Sexuality}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mars-Jones|first1=Adam|title=Black is the colour|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/black-is-the-colour-1257983.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Mercer|first1=Kobena|editor1-last=Read|editor1-first=Alan|title=Decolonization and Disappointment: Reading Fanon's Sexual Politics|date=1996|publisher=Bay Press|location=Seattle|chapter=The fact of Blackness: Frantz Fanon and Visual Representation}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fuss|first1=Diana|title=Interior Colonies: Frantz Fanon and the Politics of Identification|journal=Diacritics|date=1994|volume=24|issue=2/3|pages=19–42|jstor=465162|doi=10.2307/465162}}</ref>

Fanon's legacy has expanded even further into Black Studies and more specifically, into the theories of [[Afro-pessimism (United States)|Afro-pessimism]] and Black Critical Theory. Thinkers such as [[Sylvia Wynter]], [[David Marriott]], [[Frank B. Wilderson III]], Jared Sexton, Calvin Warren, and Zakkiyah Iman Jackson have taken up Fanon's [[Ontology|ontological]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]], and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] analyses of the Negro and the "zone of non-being" in order to develop theories of anti-Blackness. Putting Fanon in conversation with prominent thinkers such as Sylvia Wynter, [[Saidiya Hartman]], and [[Hortense Spillers]], and focusing primarily on the Charles Lam Markmann translation of ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'', Black Critical Theorists and Afropessimists take seriously the ontological implications of the "Fact of Blackness" and "The Negro and Psychopathology", formulating the Black or the Slave as the non-relational, phobic object that constitutes [[Antonio Gramsci|civil society]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Skin, White Masks|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|others=Markmann, Charles Lam., Sardar, Ziauddin., Bhabha, Homi K., 1949-|isbn=9781435691063|edition= New|location=London|oclc=298658340}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Red, White & Black : Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms|last=Wilderson III|first=Frank B.|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822346920|location=Durham, NC|oclc=457770963}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Whither Fanon?: Studies in the Blackness of Being|last=Marriott|first=D.|year=2018|isbn=9780804798709|location=Stanford, California|oclc=999542477}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Amalgamation schemes : Antiblackness and the Critique of Multiracialism|last=Jared|first=Sexton|date=2008|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816656639|location=Minneapolis|oclc=318220788}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Scenes of subjection : Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America|last=Hartman|first=Saidiya V.|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195089839|location=New York|oclc=36417797}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Ontological Terror: Blackness, Nihilism, and Emancipation|last=Warren|first=Calvin L.|isbn=9780822371847|location=Durham|oclc=1008764960|date = 10 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Black, White, and in Color : Essays on American Literature and Culture|last=Spillers|first=Hortense J.|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226769798|location=Chicago|oclc=50604796}}</ref>
