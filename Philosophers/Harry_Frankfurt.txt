'''Harry Gordon Frankfurt''' (May 29, 1929 – July 16, 2023) was an American philosopher. He was a [[professor emeritus]] of philosophy at [[Princeton University]], where he taught from 1990 until 2002. Frankfurt also taught at [[Yale University]], [[Rockefeller University]], and [[Ohio State University]].

Frankfurt made significant contributions to fields like ethics and [[philosophy of mind]]. The attitude of caring played a central role in his philosophy. To care about something means to see it as [[important]] and reflects the [[Moral character|person's character]]. According to Frankfurt, a person is someone who has [[Higher-order volition|second-order volitions]] or who cares about what [[Desire (philosophy)|desires]] he or she has. He contrasts persons with wantons. Wantons are beings that have desires but do not care about which of their desires is translated into [[Action (philosophy)|action]]. In the field of ethics, Frankfurt gave various influential counterexamples, so-called [[Frankfurt cases]], against the principle that [[moral responsibility]] depends on the [[Ability#Free will|ability to do otherwise]]. His most popular book is ''[[On Bullshit]]'', which discusses the distinction between [[Bullshit (philosophy)|bullshitting]] and lying.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Frankfurt was born '''David Bernard Stern''' at a home for unwed mothers in [[Langhorne, Pennsylvania]], on May 29, 1929, and did not know his biological parents. Shortly after his birth, he was adopted by a middle-class Jewish family and given a new name, Harry Gordon Frankfurt. His adoptive parents, Bertha (née Gordon) and Nathan Frankfurt, a piano teacher and a bookkeeper, respectively, raised him in Brooklyn and Baltimore. He attended [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1949 and Doctor of Philosophy in 1954, both in philosophy.<ref name="New York Times" />

===Career===
Frankfurt was professor emeritus of [[philosophy]] at Princeton University.<ref name="Princeton:0">{{cite web |title=Harry Frankfurt |url=https://philosophy.princeton.edu/people/harry-frankfurt |website=Department of Philosophy |publisher=Princeton University |access-date=July 23, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230718203024/https://philosophy.princeton.edu/people/harry-frankfurt |archive-date=July 18, 2023 |language=en |format=by the [[Wayback Machine]]}}</ref>

His major areas of interest included [[moral philosophy]], [[philosophy of mind]] and [[philosophy of action|action]], and 17th-century [[rationalism]]. His 2005 book ''[[On Bullshit]]'', originally published in 1986 as a paper on the concept of "bullshit", unexpectedly became a [[bestseller]], which led to his making media appearances such as on [[Jon Stewart]]'s late-night television program, ''[[The Daily Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dougherty |first1=Peter |title=The Character of Its Content |url=https://paw.princeton.edu/article/character-its-content |website=Princeton Alumni Weekly |date=December 6, 2017}}</ref> In this work he explains how bullshitting is different from lying, in that it is an act that has no regard for the truth. He argues that "It is impossible for someone to lie unless he thinks he knows the truth. Producing bullshit requires no such conviction." In 2006, he followed up with ''On Truth'', a companion book in which he explored the dwindling appreciation in society for truth.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McCulloch |first1=Alison |title=Bull Session |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/books/review/McCulloch.t.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 12, 2006 }}</ref>

Among philosophers, he was for a time best known for his interpretation of [[Descartes]]'s rationalism.  His most influential work, however, has been on [[freedom of the will]] (on which he has written numerous important papers<ref>Feinberg; Shafer-Landau: ''Reason & Responsibility'', p. 486.</ref>) based on his concept of [[higher-order volition]]s and for developing "[[Frankfurt cases]]" (also known as "Frankfurt counter-examples", which are [[thought experiment]]s designed to demonstrate the possibility of situations in which a person could not have done other than he/she did, but in which our intuition is to say nonetheless that this feature of the situation does not prevent that person from being morally responsible).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frankfurt|first=Harry G.|date=December 4, 1969 |title=Alternate Possibilities and Moral Responsibility |url=https://www.pdcnet.org/jphil/content/jphil_1969_0066_0023_0829_0839 |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]]|volume=66|issue=23|pages=829–839|doi=10.2307/2023833|jstor=2023833}}</ref>  Frankfurt's view of [[compatibilism]] is perhaps the most influential version of compatibilism, developing the view that to be free is to have one's actions conform to one's more reflective desires. Frankfurt's version of compatibilism is the subject of a substantial number of citations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Understanding Moral Responsibility within the Context of the Free Will Debate |url=https://cah.ucf.edu/fpr/article/understanding-moral-responsibility-within-the-context-of-the-free-will-debate/ |via=University of Central Florida}}</ref>  More recently, he wrote on love and caring in ''The Reasons of Love''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Reasons of Love |url=https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691191478/the-reasons-of-love |publisher=Princeton |author=Harry G.

== Philosophy ==
=== Caring and importance ===
According to Frankfurt, a lot of the philosophical discourse concerns either the domain of [[epistemology]], which asks what we should believe, or [[ethics]], which asks how we should [[Action (philosophy)|act]]. He argues that there is another branch of inquiry that has received less attention, namely the question of what has importance or what we should [[Importance#Caring|care]] about.<ref name="Frankfurt1982">{{cite journal |last1=Frankfurt |first1=Harry |title=The Importance of What We Care About |journal=Synthese |date=1982 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=257–272 |doi=10.1007/BF00484902 |jstor=20115802 |s2cid=46967621 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20115802 |issn=0039-7857}}</ref> An agent cares about something if he/she has a certain attitude of the will: He/she sees the entity in question as important to them. For Frankfurt, what we care about reflects our [[Moral character|personal character]] or who we are. This also affects the person on the practical level concerning how he/she acts and leads his/her life.<ref name="Jouan2008">{{cite journal |last1=Jouan |first1=Marlène |title=Harry Frankfurt's Metaphysics of Care: Towards an Ethics Without Reason |journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism |date=2008 |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=759–797 |doi=10.1177/0191453708093085 |s2cid=143684323 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MJOHFM}}</ref><ref name="Frankfurt1999">{{cite book |last1=Frankfurt |first1=Harry G. |title=Necessity, Volition, and Love |date=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-63395-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GX-JLyXihY0C |language=en |chapter=14. On Caring}}</ref>

In the academic literature, caring is often understood as a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] attitude in contrast to importance as an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] factor. On this view, the importance of something determines whether it is appropriate to care about it: people should care about important things but not about unimportant ones.<ref name="Kahane2022">{{cite book |last1=Kahane |first1=Guy |editor1-last=Landau |editor1-first=Iddo |title=The Oxford Handbook of Meaning in Life |date=June 10, 2022 |url=https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190063504.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190063504-e-6 |language=en |chapter=Meaningfulness and Importance|pages=92–108 |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190063504.013.6 |isbn=978-0-19-006350-4 }}</ref><ref name="Kahane2021a">{{cite journal |last1=Kahane |first1=Guy |title=Importance, Value, and Causal Impact |journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy |date=August 13, 2021 |volume=-1 |issue=aop |pages=577–601 |doi=10.1163/17455243-20213581 |s2cid=238678531 |url=https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20213581/article-10.1163-17455243-20213581.xml |issn=1745-5243}}</ref><ref name="Benbaji2001">{{cite journal |last1=Benbaji |first1=Yitzhak |title=The Moral, the Personal, and the Importance of What We Care about |journal=Philosophy |date=2001 |volume=76 |issue=297 |pages=415–433 |doi=10.1017/S0031819101000365 |jstor=3751779 |s2cid=143737564 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3751779 |issn=0031-8191}}</ref> Frankfurt defends a different perspective on this issue by arguing that caring about something makes this thing important. So when a person starts caring about something, this thing becomes important to them even if it was unimportant to them before. Frankfurt explains this in terms of needs: the caring attitude brings with it a need. Because of this need, the cared-for thing can affect the person's well-being and has thereby become important to them.<ref name="Frankfurt1982"/><ref name="Benbaji2001"/> Yitzhak Benbaji terms this relation between caring and importance "Frankfurt's Care-Importance Principle". He rejects it based on the claim that at least some cases of the caring attitude are misguided. This usually involves situations in which the agent has a wrong belief that the object of their caring would affect their well-being. In one example, the agent follows a charlatan's health advice to avoid a certain type of food. Benbaji argues that this constitutes a counterexample because the person cares about avoiding this food even though it has no impact on their health or their well-being.<ref name="Benbaji2001"/>

=== Personhood ===
Persons are characterized by certain attributes or capacities, like reason, moral responsibility, and self-consciousness.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tshivhase |first1=Mpho |chapter=Personhood: Implications for Moral Status and Uniqueness of Women |title=Handbook of African Philosophy of Difference |date=2020 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-030-14835-5 |pages=347–360 |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-030-14835-5_17 |language=en |series=Handbooks in Philosophy |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-14835-5_17 |s2cid=260602264 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Joel |title=Self-Consciousness |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-consciousness/#SelfConsPers |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=July 6, 2022 |date=2020}}</ref> However, there is wide disagreement, both within the academic discourse and between different cultures about what the essential features of personhood are.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shir-Vertesh |first1=Dafna |title=Personhood |url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0169.xml |website=Oxford Bibliographies |access-date=July 6, 2022 |language=en}}</ref> One influential and precisely formulated account of personhood is given by Frankfurt in his "Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person". He holds that persons are beings that have [[Higher-order volition|second-order volitions]].<ref name="Vezér">{{cite journal |last1=Vezér |first1=Martin Alexander |title=On the Concept of Personhood: A Comparative Analysis of Three Accounts |journal=LYCEUM |date=2007 |volume=IX |issue=1 |url=http://lyceumphilosophy.com/?q=node/86}}</ref><ref name="Norris">{{cite journal |last1=Norris |first1=Christopher |title=Frankfurt on Second-Order Desires and the Concept of a Person |journal=Prolegomena |date=2010 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=199–242 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/NORFOS}}</ref> A volition is an effective desire, i.e. a desire that the agent is committed to realizing.<ref name="Frankfurt1971"/><ref name="Fischer2018">{{cite book |last1=Fischer |first1=John Martin |last2=Ravizza |first2=Mark |title=Perspectives on Moral Responsibility |date=July 5, 2018 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-1-5017-2156-4 |page=217 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06FhDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA217 |language=en}}</ref> Not all desires become volitions: humans usually have many desires but put only some of them into [[Action (philosophy)|action]]. For example, the agent may have one desire to eat an unhealthy cake but follows their other desire to have a healthy salad instead. In this case, eating the cake is a mere desire while eating the salad is a volition. Frankfurt places great importance on the difference between first- and second-order desires. Most regular desires, like the desire to eat healthy food or to buy a car, are first-order desires. Second-order desires are desires about desires.<ref name="Frankfurt1971"/><ref name="Vezér"/><ref name="Norris"/> So the desire to have a desire to eat healthy food is a second-order desire. Entities with first-order desires care about what the world around them is like, for example, whether they own a car or not. Entities with second-order desires care also about themselves, i.e. what they themselves are like and what mental states they possess. A second-order desire becomes a second-order volition if it is effective, i.e. if the agent is committed to realizing it by fostering the corresponding first-order desire. Frankfurt sees this as the mark of personhood because entities with second-order volitions do not just have desires but care about which desires they have. So persons are committed to the desires they have.<ref name="Fischer2018"/><ref name="Vezér"/>
 
According to Frankfurt, not every entity with a mind is a person. He refers to such entities as "wantons". Wantons have desires and follow them but do not care about their own will. In this regard, they are indifferent to which of their desires become effective and are translated into action. Frankfurt holds that personhood is an important feature of humans but not of other animals. However, even some humans may be wantons at times. Various of Frankfurt's examples of such cases involve some forms of [[akrasia]] in which a person acts according to a first-order desire that he/she does not want to have on the second order. For example, a struggling drug addict may follow his/her first-order desire to take drugs despite having a second-order desire to stop wanting drugs.<ref name="Frankfurt1971">{{cite journal |last1=Frankfurt |first1=Harry G. |title=Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person |journal=Journal of Philosophy |date=1971 |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=5–20 |doi=10.2307/2024717 |jstor=2024717 |url=https://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~schopra/Persons/Frankfurt.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Vezér"/><ref name="Norris"/>

=== Moral responsibility and principle of alternative possibilities ===
The term "[[moral responsibility]]" refers to the forward-looking [[moral obligation]] to perform certain actions and to the backward-looking status of being [[Desert (philosophy)|worthy]] of blame or praise for having done something or having failed to do so.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Klein |first= Martha |author-link= Martha Klein |editor-first= Ted |editor-last= Honderich |editor-link = Ted Honderich | encyclopedia = Oxford Companion to Philosophy | title = responsibility | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001/acref-9780199264797-e-2205 | year = 2005 | quote = The term 'moral responsibility' covers (i) the having of a moral obligation and (ii) the fulfilment of the criteria for deserving blame or praise (punishment or reward) for a morally significant act or omission.|doi= 10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001 |isbn= 978-0199264797 |publisher= Oxford University Press }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Talbert |first1=Matthew |title=Moral Responsibility |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-responsibility/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=July 6, 2022 |date=2019}}</ref> An important principle in this regard is the ''principle of alternative possibilities''. It states that "a person is morally responsible for what she has done only if she could have done otherwise".<ref name="Robb2020">{{cite web |last1=Robb |first1=David |title=Moral Responsibility and the Principle of Alternative Possibilities |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alternative-possibilities/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=July 6, 2022 |date=2020}}</ref> Having this [[Ability#Free will|ability to do otherwise]] is usually associated with having [[free will]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kittle |first1=Simon |title=Abilities to Do Otherwise |journal=Philosophical Studies |date=2015 |volume=172 |issue=11 |pages=3017–3035 |doi=10.1007/s11098-015-0455-8 |s2cid=170485685 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/KITATD}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Talbert |first1=Matthew |title=Moral Responsibility: 1.

However, this may not be the case under special circumstances, for example, if a [[neurological disorder]] compelled them to do it. Frankfurt has rejected the principle of alternative possibilities based on a series of counterexamples, the so-called "[[Frankfurt cases]]". In one example, Allison's father has implanted a computer chip in Allison's head without her knowing. This chip would force Allison to walk her dog. However, Allison freely decides to do so and the chip is thus not activated. Frankfurt argues that, in this case, Allison is morally responsible for walking her dog even though she lacked the ability to do otherwise. The crux of this and similar cases is that the agent is morally responsible because he/she acted in accordance with his/her own will. This is so despite the fact that, usually unbeknownst to the agent, there was no real alternative.<ref name="Robb2020"/><ref name="Timpe">{{cite web |last1=Timpe |first1=Kevin |title=Free Will |url=https://iep.utm.edu/freewill/#SH5b |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=July 6, 2022}}</ref> This line of thought has led Frankfurt to advocate a form of [[compatibilism]]: If free will and moral responsibility do not depend on the ability to do otherwise, then they could even exist in a fully [[Determinism|deterministic]] world.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McKenna |first1=Michael |last2=Coates |first2=D.

However, not everyone agrees that they are successful at disproving it.<ref name="Robb2020"/>

==Personal life and death==
Harry Frankfurt was first married to Marilyn Rothman. They had two daughters. The marriage ended in divorce. He then married Joan Gilbert.<ref name="New York Times" />

Frankfurt was an amateur classical pianist. He started taking piano lessons from an early age, initially from his mother who hoped that he might pursue a career as a concert pianist. Frankfurt continued to play piano and receive lessons throughout his life, alongside his philosophical career. According to Frankfurt, becoming a professor of philosophy was acceptable to his mother, seeing as it was "close enough" to her other ambition for him, which was to become a rabbi.<ref>{{Citation |title=2017 A Life of Learning by Harry G.
