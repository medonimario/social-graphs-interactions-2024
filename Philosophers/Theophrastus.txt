'''Theophrastus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|θ|iː|.|ə|ˈ|f|r|æ|s|t|ə|s}}; {{langx|grc|Θεόφραστος|lit=godly phrased|translit=Theophrastos}}; c. 371 – c. 287 BC) was an ancient Greek [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Natural history|naturalist]]. A native of [[Eresos]] in [[Lesbos]], he was [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] close colleague and successor as head of the [[Lyceum (classical)|Lyceum]], the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic school of philosophy]] in [[Athens]]. Theophrastus wrote numerous treatises across all areas of philosophy, working to support, improve, expand, and develop [[Aristotelian system|the Aristotelian system]]. He made significant contributions to various fields, including [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], [[botany]], and [[natural history]]. Often considered the "father of botany" for his groundbreaking works "[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants]]" ({{langx|grc|Περὶ φυτῶν ἱστορία|translit=Peri phytōn historia}}) and "On the Causes of Plants," ({{langx|grc|Περὶ αἰτιῶν φυτικῶν|translit=Peri aitiōn phytikōn}}) Theophrastus established the foundations of [[Botany|botanical science]]. His given name was {{grc-transl|Tyrtamos}} ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Τύρταμος}}); the nickname Theophrastus ("divine speaker") was reputedly given to him by Aristotle in recognition of his eloquent style.

He came to [[Athens]] at a young age and initially studied in [[Platonic Academy|Plato's school]]. After Plato's death, he attached himself to Aristotle who took to Theophrastus in his writings. When Aristotle fled Athens, Theophrastus took over as head of the [[Lyceum (classical)|Lyceum]].<ref name="Ancient Botany p8">{{cite book |first1=Gavin|last1=Hardy |first2=Laurence|last2=Totelin |title=Ancient Botany |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2015 |page=8 |isbn=}}</ref> Theophrastus presided over the Peripatetic school for thirty-six years, during which time the school flourished greatly. He is often considered the father of [[botany]] for his works on plants.<ref>Matthew Hall, ''Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany'', p. 28.</ref> After his death, the Athenians honoured him with a public funeral. His successor as head of the school was [[Strato of Lampsacus]].

The interests of Theophrastus were wide ranging, including [[biology]], [[physics]], [[ethics]] and [[metaphysics]]. His two surviving botanical works, ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus book)|Enquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum)]]'' and ''On the Causes of Plants'', were an important influence on [[Renaissance science]]. There are also surviving works ''On Moral Characters'', ''On Sense Perception'', and ''On Stones'', as well as fragments on ''Physics'' and ''Metaphysics''. In philosophy, he studied [[grammar]] and [[language]] and continued Aristotle's work on [[logic]]. He also regarded [[space]] as the mere arrangement and position of bodies, [[time]] as an accident of motion, and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] as a necessary consequence of all activity.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}} In [[ethics]], he regarded [[happiness]] as depending on external influences as well as on [[virtue]].

== Life ==
Most of the biographical information about Theophrastus was provided by [[Diogenes Laërtius]]' ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', written more than four hundred years after Theophrastus's time.<ref name= Hort1916>{{harvnb|Hort|1916|loc=Book I–V}}</ref> He was a native of [[Eresos]] in [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]].<ref>Strabo, xiii.; {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;36, etc}}.</ref> His given name was '''Tyrtamus''' ({{lang|grc|Τύρταμος}}), but he later became known by the nickname "Theophrastus", given to him, it is said, by [[Aristotle]] to indicate the grace of his conversation (from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|Θεός}} 'god' and {{lang|grc|φράζειν}} 'to phrase', i.e. divine expression).<ref>Strabo, xiii.; {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;38}}</ref>

[[File:Aristotle Theophrastus Strato Lebiedzki Rahl.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Aristotle]], Theophrastus, and [[Strato of Lampsacus]]. Part of a fresco in the portico of the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]] painted by [[Carl Rahl]], {{circa|1888}}.]]

After receiving instruction in philosophy on Lesbos from one Alcippus, he moved to [[Athens]], where he may have studied under [[Plato]].{{efn|"Theophrastus is said to have studied first at Eresus under Alcippus, then at Athens under Plato. The latter report is problematic; but if true, it would explain an early association with Aristotle."{{harv|''Encyclopedia of classical philosophy''|1997|p=552}}.}} He became friends with Aristotle, and when Plato died (348/7 BC) Theophrastus may have joined Aristotle in his self-imposed exile from Athens. When Aristotle moved to [[Mytilene]] on Lesbos in 345/4, it is very likely that he did so at the urging of Theophrastus.{{sfn|''Encyclopedia of classical philosophy''|1997|p=552}} It seems that it was on Lesbos that Aristotle and Theophrastus began their research into [[natural science]], with Aristotle studying animals and Theophrastus studying plants.{{sfn|Grene|Depew|2004|p=11}} Theophrastus probably accompanied Aristotle to [[Macedon]]ia when Aristotle was appointed tutor to [[Alexander the Great]] in 343/2.{{sfn|''Encyclopedia of classical philosophy''|1997|p=552}} Around 335 BC, Theophrastus moved with Aristotle to Athens, where Aristotle began teaching in the [[Lyceum (classical)|Lyceum]]. When, after the death of Alexander, anti-Macedonian feeling forced Aristotle to leave Athens, Theophrastus remained behind as head (''[[scholarch]]'') of the [[Peripatetic school]],{{sfn|''Encyclopedia of classical philosophy''|1997|p=552}} a position he continued to hold after Aristotle's death in 322/1.

Aristotle in his will made him guardian of his children, including [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], with whom he was close.{{efn|"[[Aristippus]] in the fourth book of his treatise ''On Ancient Luxury'' asserts that he was enamored of Aristotle's son Nicomachus" {{harv|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;38}}.}} Aristotle likewise bequeathed to him his library and the originals of his works,{{efn|"It may we be that we owe to Theophrastus the publication of some at least of his master's voluminous works" (Hort){{full citation needed|date=March 2016}}.}} and designated him as his successor at the Lyceum.<ref>{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;36}}; comp. Aulus Gellius, xiii. 5.</ref> [[Eudemus of Rhodes]] also had some claims to this position, and [[Aristoxenus]] is said to have resented Aristotle's choice.{{sfn|Wheeler|1911}}

Theophrastus presided over the Peripatetic school for 35 years,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;36, 58}} and died at age 85, according to Diogenes.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;40}}{{efn|"He is made indeed to say in the probably spurious Preface to the ''Characters'' that he is writing in his ninety-ninth year; while St. [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicle]]'' asserts that he lived to the age of 107" (Hort){{full citation needed|date=March 2016}}.}}
He is said to have remarked, "We die just when we are beginning to live".<ref>[[Cicero]]. ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes|Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', iii. 28; Jerome, ''Letter to Nepotian''; {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;41}}.</ref>

Under his guidance, the school flourished greatly—there were at one period more than 2,000 students, Diogenes affirms{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;36, 37}}—and at his death, according to the terms of his will preserved by Diogenes, he bequeathed to it his garden with house and colonnades as a permanent seat of instruction. The comic poet [[Menander]] was among his pupils.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;36, 37}} His popularity was shown in the regard paid to him by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]], [[Cassander]], and [[Ptolemy I of Egypt|Ptolemy]], and by the complete failure of a charge of impiety brought against him.<ref>{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;37}}; comp. Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', iv. 19.</ref>{{sfn|Filonik|2013|pp=73–74}} He was honored with a public funeral, and "the whole population of Athens, honouring him greatly, followed him to the grave."{{sfn|Wheeler|1911}}{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;41}} He was succeeded as head of the Lyceum by [[Strato of Lampsacus]].

== Writings ==
[[File:Theophrastus - Historia plantarum, 1549 - 3034262.tif|thumb|upright|left|''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia plantarum]]'', 1549]]
From the lists of Diogenes, giving 227 titles, it appears that the activity of Theophrastus extended over the whole field of contemporary knowledge. His writing probably differed little from Aristotle's treatment of the same themes, though supplementary in details. Like Aristotle, most of his writings are [[Lost literary work|lost work]]s.{{sfn|Wheeler|1911}} Thus Theophrastus, like Aristotle, had composed a first and second ''Analytic'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀναλυτικῶν προτέρων}} and {{lang|grc|Ἀναλυτικῶν ὑστέρων}}).{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;42}} He had also written books on ''Topics'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνηγμένων τόπων}}, {{lang|grc|Τοπικῶν}} and {{lang|grc|Τὰ πρὸ τῶν τόπων}});{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;42, 45, 50}} on the ''Analysis of Syllogisms'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ ἀναλύσεως συλλογισμῶν}} and {{lang|grc|Περὶ συλλογισμῶν λύσεως}}), on ''Sophisms'' ({{lang|grc|Σοφισμάτων}}) and on ''Affirmation and Denial'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ καταφάσεως καὶ ἀποφάσεως}}){{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;42, 45}} as well as on the ''Natural Philosophy'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ φύσεως}}, {{lang|grc|Περὶ φυσικῶν}}, {{lang|grc|Φυσικῶν}} and others), on ''Heaven'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ οὐρανοῦ}}), and on ''Meteorological Phenomena'' ({{lang|grc|Τῆς μεταρσιολεσχίας}} and {{lang|grc|Μεταρσιολογικῶν}}).{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;46, 50, 43, 44}}

[[File:161Theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg|upright|thumb|Frontispiece to the illustrated 1644 edition of the ''Enquiry into Plants'' (''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]'')]]

In addition, Theophrastus wrote on the ''Warm and the Cold'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ θερμοῦ καὶ ψυχροῦ}}),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;44}} on ''Water'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ ὕδατος}}), ''Fire'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ πυρóς}}),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;45}} the ''Sea'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ θαλάττης}}),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;45}} on ''Coagulation and Melting'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ πήξεων καὶ τήξεων}}), on various phenomena of organic and spiritual life,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;45}} and on the ''Soul'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ ψυχῆς}}), on ''Experience'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ ἐμπειρίας}}) and ''On Sense Perception'' (also known as ''On the Senses''; {{lang|grc|Περὶ αἰσθήσεων}}).{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;42, 46}} Likewise, we find mention of monographs of Theophrastus on the early Greek philosophers [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], [[Anaxagoras]], [[Empedocles]], [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;42, 43}} [[Diogenes of Apollonia]], [[Democritus]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;43}} which were made use of by [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]]; and also on [[Xenocrates]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;47}} against the [[Platonism|Academics]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;49}} and a sketch of the political doctrine of [[Plato]].{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;43}}

He studied general history, as we know from [[Plutarch]]'s lives of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], [[Solon]], [[Aristides]], [[Pericles]], [[Nicias]], [[Alcibiades]], [[Lysander]], [[Agesilaus]], and [[Demosthenes]], which were probably borrowed from the work on ''Lives'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ βίων}}).{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;42}} But his main efforts were to continue the labours of Aristotle in [[natural history]]. This is testified to not only by a number of treatises on individual subjects of [[zoology]], of which, besides the titles, only fragments remain, but also by his books ''On Stones'', his ''Enquiry into Plants'', and ''On the Causes of Plants'' (see below), which have come down to us entire. In politics, also, he seems to have trodden in the footsteps of Aristotle. Besides his books on the ''State'' ({{lang|grc|Πολιτικῶν}} and {{lang|grc|Πολιτικοῦ}}), we find quoted various treatises on ''Education'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ παιδείας βασιλέως}} and {{lang|grc|Περὶ παιδείας}}),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;42, 50}} on ''Royalty'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ βασιλείας}}, {{lang|grc|Περὶ παιδείας βασιλέως}} and {{lang|grc|Πρὸς Κάσανδρον περὶ βασιλείας}}),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;42, 47, 45}} on the ''Best State'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ τῆς ἀρίστης πολιτείας}}), on ''Political Morals'' ({{lang|grc|Πολιτικῶν ἐθῶν}}), and particularly his works on the ''Laws'' ({{lang|grc|Νόμων κατὰ στοιχεῖον}}, {{lang|grc|Νόμων ἐπιτομῆς}} and {{lang|grc|Περὶ νόμων}}), one of which, containing a recapitulation of the laws of various [[barbarian]] as well as [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] states, was intended to be a companion to Aristotle's outline of ''Politics'', and must have been similar to it.<ref>Cicero, ''de Finibus'', v. 4.</ref> He also wrote on [[Public speaking|oratory]] and [[poetry]].<ref>Cicero, ''de Invent.'' i. 35.</ref> Theophrastus, without doubt, departed further from Aristotle in his [[ethical]] writings,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 49, 50}} as also in his [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] investigations of [[Motion (physics)|motion]], the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and [[God]].{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;48}}

Besides these writings, Theophrastus wrote several collections of problems, out of which some things at least have passed into the ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]]'' that have come down to us under the name of Aristotle,<ref>{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;45, 47, 48}}; comp. Pliny, ''H.N.'' xxviii. 6; Aristotle, ''Probl.'' xxxiii. 12.</ref> and commentaries,<ref>{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;48, 49}}; comp. §&nbsp;43.</ref> partly [[dialogues|dialogue]],<ref>Basil. Magn. ''Epist.'' 167.</ref> to which probably belonged the ''Erotikos'' ({{lang|grc|Ἐρωτικός}}),<ref>{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;43}}; Athenaeus, xii. 2, xiii. 2.</ref> ''Megacles'' ({{lang|grc|Μεγακλῆς}}),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;47}} ''Callisthenes'' ({{lang|grc|Καλλισθένης}}),<ref>{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;44}}; Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iii. 10; Alexander of Aphrodisius, ''de Anima'', ii.</ref> and ''Megarikos'' ({{lang|grc|Μεγαρικός}}),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;44}} and letters,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;46, 50}} partly books on [[mathematical]] sciences and their history.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;42, 46, 48, 50}}

Many of his surviving works exist only in fragmentary form. "The style of these works, as of the botanical books, suggests that, as in the case of Aristotle, what we possess consists of notes for lectures or notes taken of lectures," his translator Arthur F. Hort remarks.<ref name=Hort1916 /> "There is no literary charm; the sentences are mostly compressed and highly elliptical, to the point sometimes of obscurity".<ref name=Hort1916 /> The text of these fragments and extracts is often so corrupt that there is a certain plausibility to the well-known story that the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus were allowed to languish in the cellar of [[Neleus of Scepsis]] and his descendants.<ref name="SmithDGRBM">{{harvnb|Smith|1870|loc="Theophrastus"}}</ref>

=== On plants ===
{{Main|Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)}}

The most important of his books are two large botanical treatises, ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants]]'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ φυτῶν ἱστορία}}, generally known as {{lang|la|Historia Plantarum}}), and ''On the Causes of Plants'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Περὶ αἰτιῶν φυτικῶν}}, [[Latin]]: {{lang|la|De causis plantarum}}), which constitute the most important contribution to botanical science during antiquity and the Middle Ages,{{sfn|Wheeler|1911}} the first systemization of the botanical world; on the strength of these works some, following [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], call him the "father of [[botany]]".{{sfn|Grene|Depew|2004|p=11}}

The ''Enquiry into Plants'' was originally ten books, of which nine survive. The work is arranged into a system whereby plants are classified according to their modes of generation, their localities, their sizes, and according to their practical uses such as foods, juices, herbs, etc.<ref name="Long1842">{{harvnb|Long|1842|pp=332–224}}</ref> The first book deals with the parts of plants; the second book with the reproduction of plants and the times and manner of sowing; the third, fourth, and fifth books are devoted to trees, their types, their locations, and their practical applications; the sixth book deals with [[shrubs]] and spiny plants; the seventh book deals with herbs; the eighth book deals with plants that produce edible seeds; and the ninth book deals with plants that produce useful juices, [[natural gum|gums]], [[resins]], etc.<ref name="Long1842" />

''On the Causes of Plants'' was originally eight books, of which six survive. It concerns the growth of plants; the influences on their fecundity; the proper times they should be sown and reaped; the methods of preparing the soil, manuring it, and the use of tools; and of the smells, tastes, and properties of many types of plants.<ref name="Long1842" /> The work deals mainly with the economical uses of plants rather than their medicinal uses, although the latter is sometimes mentioned.<ref name="Long1842" /> A book on wines and a book on plant smells may have once been part of the complete work.<ref>Gavin Hardy and Laurence Totelin, ''Ancient Botany'', 2015, p. 10.</ref>

Although these works contain many absurd and fabulous statements, they include valuable observations concerning the functions and properties of plants.<ref name="Long1842" /> Theophrastus observed the process of [[germination]] and recognized the significance of climate to plants. Much of the information on the Greek plants may have come from his own observations, as he is known to have travelled throughout Greece, and to have had a botanical garden of his own; but the works also profit from the reports on plants of Asia brought back from those who followed [[Alexander the Great]]: {{quote|to the reports of Alexander's followers he owed his accounts of such plants as the [[Cotton|cotton-plant]], [[banyan]], [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[cinnamon]], [[myrrh]], and [[frankincense]].<ref name=Hort1916 />}}

Theophrastus's ''Enquiry into Plants'' was first published in a [[Latin]] translation by [[Theodore Gaza]], at Treviso, 1483;{{efn|Theodore Gaza, a refugee from [[Thessalonica]], was working from a lost Greek manuscript that was different from any others (Hort){{full citation needed|date=March 2016}}.}} in its original [[editio princeps|Greek it first appeared]] from the press of [[Aldus Manutius]] at Venice, 1495–98, from a third-rate manuscript, which, like the majority of the manuscripts that were sent to printers' workshops in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, has disappeared.{{efn|It was carefully copied in a printing at [[Basel]], 1541.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} }} [[Christian Friedrich Heinrich Wimmer|Christian Wimmer]] identified two manuscripts of first quality, the ''Codex Urbinas'' in the [[Vatican Library]], which was not made known to [[Johann Gottlob Schneider|J. G. Schneider]], who made the first modern critical edition, 1818–21, and the excerpts in the ''Codex Parisiensis'' in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].

=== On moral characters ===
His book {{anchor|Characters}}''Characters'' ({{lang|grc|Ἠθικοὶ χαρακτῆρες}}) contains thirty brief outlines of moral types. They are the first recorded attempt at systematic [[character sketch|character writing]]. The book has been regarded by some as an independent work; others incline to the view that the sketches were written from time to time by Theophrastus, and collected and edited after his death; others, again, regard the ''Characters'' as part of a larger systematic work, but the style of the book is against this. Theophrastus has found many imitators in this kind of writing, notably [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] (1608), [[Thomas Overbury|Sir Thomas Overbury]] (1614–16), [[John Earle (bishop)|Bishop Earle]] (1628), and [[Jean de La Bruyère]] (1688), who also translated the ''Characters''.{{sfn|Wheeler|1911}} [[George Eliot]] also took inspiration from Theophrastus's ''Characters'', most notably in her book of caricatures, ''[[Impressions of Theophrastus Such]]''. Writing the "character sketch" as a scholastic exercise also originated in Theophrastus's typology.{{Cn|date=February 2021}}

=== On sensation ===
A treatise ''On Sense Perception'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ αἰσθήσεων}}) and its objects is important for a knowledge of the doctrines of the more ancient Greek philosophers regarding the subject. A paraphrase and commentary on this work was written by [[Priscian of Lydia]] in the sixth century.<ref name="Long1842" /> With this type of work we may connect the fragments on ''Smells'', on ''Fatigue'', on ''Dizziness'', on ''Sweat'', on ''Swooning'', on ''Palsy'', and on ''Honey''.<ref name="SmithDGRBM" />

=== Physics ===
Fragments of a ''History of Physics'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ φυσικῶν ἱστοριῶν}}) are extant. To this class of work belong the still extant sections on ''Fire'', on the ''Winds'', and on the signs of ''Waters'', ''Winds'', and ''Storms''.<ref>Probably out of the fourth book of the ''Meteorology'' ("ἐν τετάρτῃ περὶ μεταρσίων") of Theophrastus: see Plutarch, ''Quaest. Gr.'' vii.</ref>

Various smaller scientific fragments have been collected in the editions of [[Johann Gottlob Schneider]] (1818–21) and [[Christian Friedrich Heinrich Wimmer|Friedrich Wimmer]] (1842–62) and in [[Hermann Usener]]'s ''Analecta Theophrastea''.{{sfn|Wheeler|1911}}

=== Metaphysics ===
The ''Metaphysics'' (anachronistic Greek title: {{lang|grc|Θεοφράστου τῶν μετὰ τὰ φυσικά}}),<ref>[[Dimitri Gutas]] (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YdIIYCpEXHMC ''Theophrastus – On First Principles: known as His Metaphysics''], Brill, 2010, p. 10.</ref> in nine chapters (also known as ''On First Principles''), was considered a fragment of a larger work by Usener in his edition (Theophrastos<!--[sic]-->, ''Metaphysica'', Bonn, 1890), but according to Ross and Fobes in their edition (Theophrastus, ''Metaphysica'', Oxford, 1929), the treatise is complete (p.&nbsp;X) and this opinion is now widely accepted. There is no reason for assigning this work to some other author because it is not noticed in [[Hermippus of Smyrna|Hermippus]] and [[Andronicus of Rhodes|Andronicus]], especially as [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] had already mentioned it.<ref name="SmithDGRBM" />

=== On stones ===
In his treatise ''On Stones'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ λίθων}}), which would become a source for other  [[lapidary (text)|lapidaries]] until at least the [[Renaissance]],{{sfn|Walton|2001|pp=359–364}} Theophrastus classified rocks and gems based on their behavior when heated, further grouping minerals by common properties, such as [[amber]] and [[magnetite]], which both have the power of attraction.<ref name="Cuvier1830">{{harvnb|Cuvier|1830|pp=76–83}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Richards|Caley|1956|p=238}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Caley|1956}}.</ref>

Theophrastus describes different [[marble]]s; mentions [[coal]], which he says is used for heating by metal-workers; describes the various [[ore|metal ores]]; and knew that [[pumice|pumice stones]] had a [[volcanic]] origin. He also deals with precious stones, [[emeralds]], [[amethysts]], [[onyx]], [[jasper]], etc., and describes a variety of "sapphire" that was blue with veins of gold, and thus was presumably [[lapis lazuli]].<ref name="Cuvier1830" />

He knew that [[pearls]] came from [[shellfish]], that [[coral]] came from India, and speaks of the [[fossilized]] remains of organic life.<ref name="Cuvier1830" /> He also considers the practical uses of various stones, such as the minerals necessary for the manufacture of glass; for the production of various pigments of paint such as [[ochre]]; and for the manufacture of [[plaster]].<ref name="Cuvier1830" />

Many of the rarer minerals were found in mines, and Theophrastus mentions the famous [[copper]] mines of [[Cyprus]] and the even more famous [[silver mine]]s, presumably of [[Laurium]] near [[Athens]] – the basis of the wealth of the city – as well as referring to [[gold mines]]. The Laurium silver mines, which were the property of the state, were usually leased for a fixed sum and a percentage on the working. Towards the end of the fifth century BCE the output fell, partly owing to the [[Sparta]]n occupation of [[Decelea]] from {{circa | 413}} BCE. But the mines continued to be worked, though [[Strabo]] ({{circa | 64}} BCE to {{circa | 24}} CE) records that in his time the tailings were being worked over, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] ({{circa | 110}} to {{circa | 180}}) speaks of the mines as a thing of the past. The ancient workings, consisting of shafts and galleries for excavating the ore, and washing tables for extracting the metal, may still be seen. Theophrastus wrote a separate work ''On Mining'',{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;44}} which – like most of his writings – is a [[Lost literary work|lost work]].

[[Pliny the Elder]] makes clear references to his use of ''On Stones'' in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of 77 AD, while updating and making much new information available on [[minerals]] himself. Although Pliny's treatment of the subject is more extensive, Theophrastus is more systematic and his work is comparatively free from fable and magic,{{sfn|Healy|1999|pp= 17–7}} although he did describe [[lyngurium]], a gemstone supposedly formed of the solidified urine of the [[lynx]] (the best ones coming from wild males), which featured in many lapidaries until it gradually disappeared from view in the 17th century.{{sfn|Walton|2001|loc= abstract & throughout}}
It is mistakenly attributed to Theophrastus the first record of pyroelectricity. The misconception arose soon after the discovery of the pyroelectric properties of [[tourmaline]], which made mineralogists of the time associate the ''[[lyngurium]]'' with it.<ref>Earle R. Caley and John F.C. Richards, ''Theophrastus: On Stones'' (Columbus, Ohio: Ohio State University, 1956), page 110, line 12 of the commentary: "Watson identifies the ''lyngounon'' of Theophrastus with tourmaline, but evidently his opinion is partly based on the attractive properties of heated tourmaline which had recently been discovered. This identification is repeated by various later writers. For example, Dana states that ''lyncurium'' is supposed to be the ancient name for common tourmaline. However, the absence of tourmaline among surviving examples of ancient gems is clearly against this view."</ref> [[Lyngurium]] is described in the work of Theophrastus as being similar to [[amber]], capable of attracting "straws and bits of wood", but without specifying any pyroelectric properties.<ref>Earle R. Caley and John F.C. Richards, ''Theophrastus: On Stones'' (Columbus, Ohio: Ohio State University, 1956), page 51, paragraph 28 of the original text: "It [''smaragdos''] is remarkable in its powers, and so is the ''lyngourion'' [i.e., lynx-urine stone] … . It has the power of attraction, just as amber has, and some say that it not only attracts straws and bits of wood, but also copper and iron, if the pieces are thin, as Diokles used to explain."</ref>

The extent to which Theophrastus followed Aristotle's doctrines, or defined them more accurately, or conceived them in a different form, and what additional structures of thought he placed upon them, can only be partially determined because of the loss of so many of his writings.<ref name="SmithDGRBM" /> Many of his opinions have to be reconstructed from the works of later writers such as [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Ierodiakonou |first=Katerina |title=Theophrastus |date=2020 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entriesheophrastus/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Winter 2020 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=2022-07-07 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

=== Logic ===
Theophrastus seems to have carried out still further the [[grammatical]] foundation of [[logic]] and [[rhetoric]], since in his book on the elements of [[speech]], he distinguished the main parts of speech from the subordinate parts, and also direct expressions ({{lang|grc|κυρία λέξις}} {{Transl|grc|kuria lexis}}) from metaphorical expressions, and dealt with the emotions ({{lang|grc|πάθη}} {{Transl|grc|pathe}}) of speech.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Categ.'' 8.</ref> He further distinguished a twofold reference of speech ({{lang|grc|σχίσις}} {{Transl|grc|schisis}}) to things ({{lang|grc|πράγματα}} {{Transl|grc|pragmata}}) and to the hearers, and referred poetry and rhetoric to the latter.<ref>Ammonius, ''de Interpr.'' 53; Schol. ''in Arist.'' 108, 27.</ref>

He wrote at length on the unity of [[judgment]],<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' f. 128, 124; Schol. ''in Arist.'' 184. 24. 183, b. 2; Boethius, ''de Interpr.''</ref> on the different kinds of negation,<ref>Ammonius, ''in Arist. de Interpr.'' 128; Schol. ''in Arist.'' 121. 18.</ref> and on the difference between unconditional and conditional necessity.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' f. 12. 6; Schol. ''in Arist.'' 149. 44.</ref> In his doctrine of [[syllogisms]] he brought forward the proof for the conversion of universal affirmative judgments, differed from Aristotle here and there in the laying down and arranging the ''modi'' of the syllogisms,<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' 14, 72, 73, 82. 22, b, 35; Boethius, ''de Syll. categ.'' ii. 594. 5, f. 603, 615.</ref> partly in the proof of them,<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' 39, b</ref> partly in the doctrine of mixture, i.e. of the influence of the modality of the premises upon the modality of the conclusion.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' 39, b. etc. 40, 42, 56, b. 82, 64, b. 51; John Phil. xxxii, b. etc.</ref> Then, in two separate works, he dealt with the reduction of arguments to the syllogistic form and on the resolution of them;<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' 115.</ref> and further, with hypothetical conclusions.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Arist. Anal. Pr.'' 109, b. etc. 131, b.; John Phil. lx. etc. lxxv.; Boethius, ''de Syll. hypoth.''</ref> For the doctrine of [[Proof (truth)|proof]], [[Galen]] quotes the second ''Analytic'' of Theophrastus, in conjunction with that of Aristotle, as the best treatises on that doctrine.<ref>Galen, ''de Hippocr. et Plat. Dogm.'' ii. 2.</ref> In different [[monograph]]s he seems to have tried to expand it into a general theory of [[science]]. To this, too, may have belonged the proposition quoted from his ''Topics'', that the ''principles of opposites'' are themselves opposed, and cannot be deduced from one and the same higher genus.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Categ.'' f. 5; Schol. p. 89. 15; comp. Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Metaph.'' 342. 30.</ref> For the rest, some minor deviations from the Aristotelian definitions are quoted from the ''Topica'' of Theophrastus.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Top.'' 5, 68, 72, 25, 31.</ref> Closely connected with this treatise was that upon ambiguous words or ideas,<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Top.'' 83, 189.</ref> which, without doubt, corresponded to book Ε of Aristotle's ''Metaphysics''.<ref name="SmithDGRBM" />

=== Physics and metaphysics ===
Theophrastus introduced his Physics with the proof that all natural existence, being corporeal and composite, requires ''principles'',<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' f. 1, 6.</ref> and first and foremost, [[Motion (physics)|motion]], as the basis of all change.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' f. 5, 6.</ref> Denying the substance of [[space]], he seems to have regarded it, in opposition to Aristotle, as the mere arrangement and position ({{Transl|grc|taxis}} and {{Transl|grc|thesis}}) of bodies.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' 149, b. 141.</ref> [[Time]] he called an accident of motion, without, it seems, viewing it, with Aristotle, as the numerical determinant of motion.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' f. 87, b; John Phil. 213. 4.</ref> He attacked the doctrine of the four [[classical elements]] and challenged whether [[fire (classical element)|fire]] could be called a primary element when it appears to be compound, requiring, as it does, another material for its own nutriment.<ref>Theophrastus, ''On Fire'', 1.</ref>

[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aristotle]]]]
He departed more widely from Aristotle in his doctrine of motion, since on the one hand he extended it over all categories, and did not limit it to those laid down by Aristotle.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Categ.''; comp. Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' 94, 201, 202, 1.</ref> He viewed motion, with Aristotle, as an activity, not carrying its own goal in itself ({{Transl|grc|ateles}}), of that which only [[Potentiality and actuality|potentially]] exists,<ref>Simplicius, l. c. and f. 94, 1.</ref> but he opposed Aristotle's view that motion required a special explanation, and he regarded it as something proper both to nature in general and the celestial system in particular:

{{quote|Surely, then, if the life in animals does not need explanation or is to be explained only in this way, may it not be the case that in the heavens too, and in the heavenly bodies, movement does not need explanation or is to be explained in a special way?|Theophrastus, ''Metaphysics'', 10a.16–29.{{sfn|Gould|1970|p=24}} }}

He recognised no activity without motion,<ref>Simplicius, ''in Categ.''</ref> and so referred all activities of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to motion: the desires and emotions to corporeal motion, judgment ({{Transl|grc|kriseis}}) and contemplation to spiritual motion.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' 225.</ref> The idea of a spirit entirely independent of organic activity, must therefore have appeared to him very doubtful; yet he appears to have contented himself with developing his doubts and difficulties on the point, without positively rejecting it.<ref>Themistius, ''in Arist. de An.'' 89, b. 91, b.</ref> Other Peripatetics, like [[Dicaearchus]], [[Aristoxenus]], and especially [[Strato of Lampsacus|Strato]], developed further this [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] in Aristotelian doctrine.

Theophrastus seems, generally speaking, where the investigation overstepped the limits of experience, to have preferred to develop the difficulties rather than solve them, as is especially apparent in his ''Metaphysics''.<ref name="SmithDGRBM" /> He was doubtful of Aristotle's [[teleology]] and recommended that such ideas be used with caution:

{{quote|With regard to the view that all things are for the sake of an end and nothing is in vain, the assignation of ends is in general not easy, as it is usually stated to be ... we must set certain limits to purposiveness and to the effort after the best, and not assert it to exist in all cases without qualification.|Theophrastus, ''Metaphysics'', 10a.22–24, 11a.1–3.{{sfn|Gould|1970b|p=25}}<!--end of quote-->}}

He did not follow the incessant attempts by Aristotle to refer phenomena to their ultimate foundations, or his attempts to unfold the internal connections between the latter, and between them and phenomena.<ref name="SmithDGRBM" /> In antiquity, it was a subject of complaint that Theophrastus had not expressed himself with precision and consistency respecting [[God]], and had understood it at one time as [[Heaven]], at another an (enlivening) breath (''[[pneuma]]'').<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Protrept.''; Cicero, ''de Natura Deorum'', i. 13.</ref>

=== Ethics ===
[[File:Theophrastus.jpg|thumb|upright|The bust inscribed "{{lang|grc|Θεόφραστος Μελάντα Ἐρέσιος}} ({{Transl|grc|Theophrastos Melanta Eresios}})"]]
Theophrastus did not allow a happiness resting merely upon virtue,<ref>Cicero, ''Academica'', i. 10, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', v. 9.</ref> or, consequently, to hold fast by the unconditional value of [[morality]]. He subordinated moral requirements to the advantage at least of a friend,<ref>Aulus Gellius, i. 3. §&nbsp;23.</ref> and had allowed in prosperity the existence of an influence injurious to them. In later times, fault was found with his expression in the ''Callisthenes'', "life is ruled by fortune, not wisdom" (''{{lang|la|vitam regit fortuna non sapientia}}'').<ref>Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iii. 10; comp. Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''de Anima'', ii.</ref> That in the definition of pleasure, likewise, he did not coincide with Aristotle, seems to be indicated by the titles of two of his writings, one of which dealt with pleasure generally, the other with pleasure as Aristotle had defined it.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§&nbsp;44}} Although, like his teacher, he preferred contemplative (theoretical), to active (practical) life,<ref>Cicero, ''ad Atticus'', ii. 16.</ref> he preferred to set the latter free from the restraints of family life, etc. in a manner of which Aristotle would not have approved.<ref>Jerome, ''Adversus Jovinianum'', i, 189.</ref>

Theophrastus was opposed to eating meat on the grounds that it robbed animals of life and was therefore unjust. Non-human animals, he said, can reason, sense, and feel just as human beings do.<ref name=Taylor35>Taylor, Angus. ''Animals and Ethics''. Broadview Press, p. 35.</ref>

== The "portrait" of Theophrastus ==
The marble [[Herma|herm figure]] with the bearded head of philosopher type, bearing the explicit inscription, must be taken as purely conventional. Unidentified portrait heads did not find a ready market in post-Renaissance Rome.{{efn|"Since 'unknown portraits' were not valued highly, identifying inscriptions were often added to classical portraits by antiquaries and collectors before modern scholarship condemned the practice", notes Eugene Dwyer.{{sfn|Dwyer|1993|p=478 note 65..}} }} This bust was formerly in the collection of marchese Pietro Massimi at Palazzo Massimi and belonged to marchese L. Massimi at the time the engraving was made. It is now in the [[Villa Albani]], Rome (inv. 1034). The inscribed bust has often been illustrated in engravings<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|1993|p={{page needed|date=March 2016}} }} notes Statius pl. xiii; Galle pl. 143; Bellori pl. 38; Gronovius, vol.
