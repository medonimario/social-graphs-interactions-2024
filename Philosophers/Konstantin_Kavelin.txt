[[File:Kavelin Konstantin Dmitrievich.jpg|thumb|right|Konstantin D. Kavelin, 1880-1884]]

'''Konstantin Dmitrievich Kavelin''' ({{langx|ru|Константи́н Дми́триевич Каве́лин}}; November 4, 1818 – May 5, 1885) was a Russian historian, jurist, and [[sociologist]], sometimes called the chief architect of early [[Russian liberalism]].

Born in [[Saint Petersburg]] into an old noble family, Kavelin graduated from the legal department of the [[Moscow University]] and read law at the [[University of St Petersburg]] from 1839. Together with [[Timofey Granovsky]] and [[Alexander Herzen]], he was one of the leading ''[[Westernizer]]s''. In 1855, Herzen published Kavelin's celebrated proposal for the emancipation of serfs, which cost him the lucrative position of [[tsesarevich]]'s tutor.  In 1862, he was forced to resign from his post for becoming politically-involved with the student, constitutional movement.<ref>{{cite journal

Some scholars believe that Kavelin was a [[prototype]] of Stiva Oblonski in [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[Anna Karenina]]''.
