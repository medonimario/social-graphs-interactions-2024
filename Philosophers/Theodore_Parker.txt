'''Theodore Parker''' (August 24, 1810 – May 10, 1860) was an American [[transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] and [[Reform movement|reforming]] [[Religious minister|minister]] of the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church. A reformer and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], his words and popular quotations would later inspire speeches by [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]

==Early life and education==
Parker was born in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]],<ref name=Hankins143>{{harvp|Hankins|2004|p=143}}</ref> the youngest child in a large farming family. His paternal grandfather was [[John Parker (captain)|John Parker]], the leader of the Lexington militia at the [[Battle of Lexington]]. Among his colonial Yankee ancestors were [[Thomas Hastings (colonist)|Thomas Hastings]], who came from the East Anglia region of England to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1634, and [[Thomas Parker (deacon)|Deacon Thomas Parker]], who came from England in 1635 and was one of the founders of [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]].<ref>Buckminster, Lydia N.H., ''The Hastings Memorial, A Genealogical Account of the Descendants of Thomas Hastings of Watertown, Mass. from 1634 to 1864''.

Most of Theodore's family had died by the time he was 27,<ref name="UUHS">{{cite web|url=http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/theodoreparker.html |title=Theodore Parker |author=Dean Grodzins |work=Unitarian Universalist Historical Society |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530203236/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/theodoreparker.html |archive-date=2012-05-30 }}</ref> probably due to [[tuberculosis]]. Out of eleven siblings, only five remained: three brothers, including Theodore, and two sisters. His mother, to whom he was emotionally close, died when he was eleven. He responded to these tragedies by refusing to lapse into what he called "the valley of tears", focusing instead on other events and demands, and by affirming "the immortality of the soul", later a benchmark of his theology.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=27–28}} Theodore's sisters Rebecca, Ruth, and Hannah all died before he was five;  by the time he was eleven, his grandmother and loved mother had also died. His brother John and two remaining sisters, Emily, Mary, and Lydia, died while he was a young man.</ref>

Descriptions of Parker as a teenager recall him as "raw" and rough, emotional and poetic, sincere, "arch", "roguish", volatile, witty, and quick. He excelled at academics and gained an early education through country schools and personal study. He studied long and late when farm chores allowed, teaching himself math, Latin, and other subjects. At seventeen he began teaching in local schools. He continued teaching himself and private students in advanced and specialized subjects.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=20–21}}</ref> He learned Hebrew from Joshua Seixas (son of [[Gershom Mendes Seixas]] and Hannah Manuel<ref>{{Cite web |editor1-last=Flatow |editor1-first=Alisa M. |editor2-last=Anflick |editor2-first=Adina |year=2019 |title=Guide to the Papers of the Seixas Family, undated, 1746–1911, 1926, 1939 |url=http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=109167 |location=New York |publisher=Center for Jewish History, American Jewish Historical Society |id=*P-60 |access-date=17 April 2019}}</ref>), whom he may have baptized in a covert conversion to Christianity.<ref>Shalom Goldman, ''God's Sacred Tongue: Hebrew & the American Imagination'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2004), 187.

[[File:Houghton MS Am 1506 (14) - Cranch.jpg|thumb|Caricature by [[Christopher Pearse Cranch]] depicting Parker's interest in [[Germans|German]] thinking]]
In 1830, at age 19, Parker walked the ten miles from Lexington to Cambridge to apply to [[Harvard College]]. He was accepted but could not pay the tuition, so he lived and studied at home, continued to work on his father's farm, and joined his classmates only for exams. Under that program, he was able to complete three years of study in one.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=22}}</ref> He then took various posts as a teacher, conducting an academy from 1831 to 1834 at [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], where his late mother's family lived. At Watertown, he met his future wife, Lydia Dodge Cabot. He announced their engagement to his father in October, 1833. Theodore and Lydia were married four years later on April 20, 1837.<ref>For Parker's time in Watertown and engagement, see Grodzins, ''American Heretic'', 36; an earlier and more poetic account is in Henry Steele Commager, ''Theodore Parker: Yankee Crusader'' (Boston: Unitarian Universalist Association, 1947), 23. For marriage, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=87}}</ref>

While at Watertown, Parker produced his first significant manuscript, ''The History of the Jews'', which outlined his skepticism of biblical miracles and an otherwise liberal approach to the Bible.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=31, 391}}. For an account written by a contemporary describing Parker's time and writings at Watertown, including ''A History of the Jews'', see [[Octavius Brooks Frothingham]], ''Theodore Parker: A Biography'' (New York: G.P. Putnam, 1880), 39.</ref> These were to be themes throughout his career.

Parker considered a career in law, but his strong [[faith]] led him to theology. He entered the [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1834.<ref>Hankins, Barry. The Second Great Awakening and the Transcendentalists. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2004: 143. {{ISBN|0-313-31848-4}}</ref> He specialized in the study of German theology and was drawn to the ideas of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]. He wrote and spoke (with varying degrees of fluency) [[Latin (language)|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and German.<ref>For his lack of speaking fluency in French and German, despite translating thousands of pages in writing, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=381}}.</ref> His journal and letters show that he was acquainted with many other languages, including [[Biblical Aramaic|Chaldee]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]]. He completed the divinity school program quickly, in 1836, in order to marry and begin preaching without delay.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=39}}</ref><ref>Commager, ''Theodore Parker'', 23-24.</ref>

==Career==
Parker called the late 1830s a "period of…disappointment". Citing "home; children; & a good professional sphere," he wrote in his journal that "All fail me, & all equally."<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=118}}</ref> Increasing controversies in his career culminated in a break with orthodoxy in the early 1840s. The fallout from these events affected him deeply, and it took him a few years to land on his feet and move forward.

===First pastorate===
Parker had spent 1836 visiting pulpits in the [[Boston]] area, but for family reasons accepted a pastorate at [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]], in 1837.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tparkerchurch.org/about/our-history/|title=Our History &#124; Theodore Parker Church|date=March 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313090117/http://www.tparkerchurch.org/about/our-history/|archive-date=2014-03-13}}</ref> At first, he found the location less than stimulating and work constraining.<ref>For pulpit touring, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=80}}; for his initial response to West Roxbury, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=89}}.</ref> He adapted to pastoral life, however, and preached in many pulpits around Boston as a visitor. He gained a wide reputation as an earnest, effective speaker. In 1840 Harvard awarded him an honorary master's degree on the basis of his extensive learning.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=175}}</ref>

Parker delivered one especially popular sermon twenty-five times between 1838 and 1841. In it, he argued against the popular notion that religion could be reduced to morality. "The principle of morality is obedience to the Law of con[science]," he wrote, while religion required more: that we "feel naturally, allegiance to a superior Being: dependence on him & accountability to him." The theme of dependence echoes [[Schleiermacher]], an indication of the [[Germans|German]] influence on his theology. Morality involves right acting, while religion requires love of God and regular prayer, which Parker considered essential to human life. "No feeling is more deeply planted in human nature than the tendency to adore a superior being," he preached, "to reverence him, to bow before him, to feel his presence, to pray to him for aid in times of need" and "to bless him when the heart is full of joy."<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=145}}</ref>

===Transcendentalism===
In 1837, Parker had begun attending meetings of the group later known as the [[Transcendental Club]]. [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s Divinity School Address that year had been deeply arresting to him,<ref>Gary J. Dorrien, The Making of American Liberal Theology: Imagining Progressive Religion, 1805-1900, 77. Dorrien writes that Emerson's Harvard address "had a formative and catalyzing effect" on Parker.</ref> and he welcomed the opportunity to associate with [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Orestes Brownson]], and several others.<ref>Buell, Lawrence. ''Emerson''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2003: 32–33. {{ISBN|0-674-01139-2}}</ref> [[Transcendentalists]] such as [[Henry David Thoreau]] and Parker wrote of the world as divine, and of themselves as part of this divinity. Unlike Emerson and other Transcendentalists, however, Parker believed the movement was rooted in deeply religious ideas and did not believe it should retreat from religion. All shared a conviction that slavery should be abolished and social reforms should take root.<ref>Hankins, The Second Great Awakening and the Transcendentalists, 28; 105; 143. On 105, Hankins notes that Parker was a Transcendentalist antislavery advocate and considered "perhaps the most important theologian the movement produced."</ref>

Parker gradually introduced Transcendentalist ideas into his sermons. He tempered his radicalism with diplomacy and discretion, however. "I preach abundant heresies," he wrote to a friend, "and they all go down—for the listeners do not know how heretical they are."<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=148}}</ref> For years he had wrestled with the factuality of the Hebrew Scriptures, and by 1837 he was wishing "some wise man would now write a book…and show up the absurdity of…the Old Testament miracles, prophecies, dreams, miraculous births, etc.'" He was hardly alone. "'What shall we do with the Old Testament?' asked fellow [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] James Walker in 1838. 'That question is of such frequent recurrence among laymen as well as clergymen, that any well-considered attempt to answer it, or supply the means of answering it, is almost sure of hearty welcome."<ref>Shalom Goldman, God's Sacred Tongue, 187.</ref> Questions regarding biblical realism and meaning, and the answers clergy increasingly found through the German-based [[higher criticism]], formed the basis of [[liberal Christianity]] as it emerged and developed throughout the nineteenth century.

In 1838 Parker published his first major article, a critical review of an orthodox work written by his former professor [[John Gorham Palfrey]]. In it Parker broke for the first time with supernatural realism, as he also increasingly did in his sermons.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=156}}</ref> To him, Christianity was natural rather than miraculous. More and more, he praised social reform movements such as those for temperance, peace, and the abolition of slavery. In 1840 he described such movements as divinely inspired, though he added that they did not fully address the spiritual and intellectual ills of society.<ref>Grodzins, American Heretic, 205.</ref> Controversy mounted regarding these and other Transcendentalist elements in his work. So did criticism, which often saddened and distressed him.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=184}} records one such experience of criticism, after which he "went weeping through the streets."</ref>

===Break with Orthodoxy===
[[Image:Theodore Parker statue.JPG|thumb|right|Parker's statue in front of the Theodore Parker Church,<ref name="TParkerChurch">{{cite web |url= http://www.tparkerchurch.org/about/history.htm |title= History of the Theodore Parker Church |quote= Established as a Calvinist Protestant church, the congregation adopted a conservative [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theology in the 1830s and followed its minister, Theodore Parker, to a more liberal position in the 1840s. When the First Parish of West Roxbury merged with the Unitarian Church of [[Roslindale, Boston, Massachusetts|Roslindale]] in 1962, the congregation decided to name their new community in memory of Theodore Parker. |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509094758/http://www.tparkerchurch.org/about/history.htm |archive-date= 2008-05-09 }}</ref> a Unitarian parish in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]].]]

In 1841, Parker laid bare his radical theological position in a sermon titled ''A Discourse on the Transient and Permanent in Christianity'', in which he espoused his belief that the traditions of historic Christianity did not reflect the truth.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Parker |first1=Theodore |title=A DISCOURSE OF THE TRANSIENT AND PERMANENT IN CHRISTIANITY |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/etas/14/ |conference=PREACHED AT THE ORDINATION OF MR. CHARLES C. SHACKFORD, IN THE HAWES PLACE CHURCH IN BOSTON  |website=Electronic Texts in American Studies |date=19 May 1841}}; [https://archive.org/details/transientandper00unkngoog alternate digitization at archive.org]</ref> In so doing, he made an open break with orthodox theology. He instead argued for a type of Christian belief and worship in which the essence of Jesus's teachings remained permanent but the words, traditions, and other forms of their conveyance did not. He stressed the immediacy of God and saw the Church as a communion, looking upon Christ as the supreme expression of God. Ultimately, he rejected all miracles and revelation and saw the Bible as full of contradictions and mistakes. He retained his faith in God but suggested that people experience God intuitively and personally, and that they should center their religious beliefs on individual experience.<ref name=Hankins143/>

Parker's West Roxbury church remained loyal. Sermons and media attacked him, however, when he denied Biblical miracles and the literal authority of the Bible and Jesus. Many questioned his Christianity. Nearly all the pulpits in the Boston area were closed to him,<ref name="Britannica nineteen eleven">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Parker, Theodore |volume=20 |page=830}}</ref> and he lost friends. Parker reacted with grief and defiance.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=307, 361}}</ref> He remained unwilling to concede that his views placed him beyond the outer bounds of Unitarian liberalism. After this unwilling break with the Unitarian establishment, he spent two years (1841–1843) adjusting to the reality of his newly controversial and independent career and increasing his social activism on religious grounds. He began to see himself as a prophetic religious reformer.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=344}} shows his first open support for [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] activism; {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=340}} notes that "For Parker, the ideal religious reformer was the solitary, heroic prophet. He was starting to see himself in this role."</ref>

==Personal life==
Parker and Lydia Cabot married in 1837, but the union was rocky from the start.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=91–102}} sketches out the initial difficulties of their marriage. Also see the journal entry reprinted as the figure "Marital strife" in {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=294}}, and taken from the Theodore Parker Papers, bMS 101, Harvard Divinity School Library of Harvard Divinity School, Cambridge, Massachusetts.</ref> In 1840 he befriended a neighbor, Anna Blake Shaw. Although their relationship was by all accounts not sexual, it caused problems with his wife.<ref>For his relationship with Shaw, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=177}}; for the relationship with his wife, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=100–102}}.</ref>

== Mature home life and career, 1843–1859 ==
[[File:Theodore Parker BPL milk glass c1850-crop.jpg|thumb|left|Parker c. 1850]]

Parker's family life, temperament, and work steadied during the 1840s. The second half of his career revolved around antislavery, democracy, and religious social activism.

===Travel to Europe===
In 1843 and 1844, Theodore and Lydia traveled in Europe. While there his theology, career, and personal life matured and steadied. He was no longer as sensitive to criticism and bore difficulties more easily.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=370}}. In {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=401–402}} Grodzins write that in Europe, "Parker's temperament grew steadier. The extraordinary sensitivity to rebuff, the intense 'agony of spirit,' seemed to disappear. Before his trip to Europe, he burst easily and often into tears; afterward, he almost never did so. He later would confront controversies far more severe, opponents far more dangerous, than any he had faced in 1841, 1842, and 1843; but none would so deeply affect him."</ref> Away from extended family problems in West Roxbury, his marriage seems to have improved and become more steadily affectionate. Despite complex issues that occasionally resurfaced, he and Lydia were happier. "My wife is kind as an angel," he would write in his journal during denominational trials in 1845. His travels also seemed to stimulate a growing interest in political and social issues.<ref>For "kind as an angel," see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=414}}. For renewed affection between the Parkers during and after their European trip, despite ongoing marital issues, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=387–401}}. For more interest in political and social issues, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=403}}.</ref>

===Independent Boston pastorate===
Returning to the United States, Parker found Unitarianism on the cusp of a division over his right to fellowship as a minister. His controversial 1841 sermon had created a stir that ballooned into an all-out storm in 1844 at the [[Church of the Disciples (Boston)|Church of the Disciples]]. The debate over the nature and degree of Parker's "infidelity" caused Unitarians to adopt a liberal creed, which they had formerly declined to do based on an inclusive principle. Their position proved too orthodox to include Parker.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=412, 431}}</ref>

In January, 1845, a sizeable group of supporters gathered at Marlboro Chapel in Boston and resolved to provide Parker "a chance to be heard in Boston." Calling themselves "Friends of Theodore Parker," they hired a hall and invited him to preach there on Sunday mornings.<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=457}}</ref> Despite misgivings, Parker accepted and preached his first sermon at the [[Melodeon (Boston, Massachusetts)]] Theater in February. Although the arrangement was temporary at first,<ref>{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=460}}</ref> he resigned his West Roxbury pastorate in early 1846 (to the dismay of his faithful parishioners there). He elected to call his new congregation the 28th Congregational Society of Boston; after the Melodeon, Parker's congregation met in the [[Boston Music Hall]] on Winter Street, Boston.<ref>On his resignation in West Roxbury and choosing a name for his new congregation, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=476}}. Also see Grodzins. "Theodore Parker". Unitarian Universalist Historical Society. The Boston Music Hall became the Orpheum Theater, with addresses at 6 ½ Hamilton Place and 413-415 Washington Street. “Orpheum Theater,” BOS.1769, Massachusetts Cultural Resources Information System (MACRIS), https://mhc-macris.net/details?mhcid=bos.1769.</ref>

Parker's congregation grew to 2,000 and included influential figures such as [[Louisa May Alcott]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[Julia Ward Howe]] (a personal friend), and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]].<ref>On the size of Parker's Melodean congregation, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=477, 491}}.</ref> Stanton called his sermons "soul-satisfying" when beginning her career, and she credited him with introducing her to the idea of a Heavenly Mother in the Trinity.<ref>Kathi Kern, ''Mrs. Stanton's Bible'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2001). For "soul-satisfying," see 45. For "Heavenly Mother," see 165.</ref> Parker was increasingly known for preaching what he and his followers identified as a type of prophetic Christian social activism.

The 28th Congregational Society, now renamed Theodore Parker Unitarian Church, located on 1851 Centre Street in West Roxbury was designated a [[Boston Landmark]] by the [[Boston Landmarks Commission]] in 1985.

===Reform movements and social theology===
After 1846, Parker shifted from a focus on Transcendentalism and challenging the bounds of Unitarian theology to a focus on the gathering national divisions over [[slavery]] and the challenges of [[democracy]]. In Boston, he led the movement to combat the stricter [[Fugitive Slave Act]], a controversial part of the [[Compromise of 1850]]. This act required law enforcement and citizens of all states—free states as well as slave states—to assist in recovering fugitive slaves. Parker called the law "a hateful statute of kidnappers" and helped organize open resistance to it. He and his followers formed the [[Boston Vigilance Committee]], which refused to assist with the recovery of fugitive slaves and helped hide them.<ref>Buescher, John. [http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24525 Keep Your Top Eye Open]. [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org] Accessed 2 June 2011.</ref> For example, they smuggled away [[Ellen and William Craft]] when Georgian slave catchers came to Boston to arrest them. Due to such efforts, from 1850 to the onset of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, only twice were slaves captured in Boston and transported back to the South. On both occasions, Bostonians combatted the actions with mass protests.<ref>Potter, David Morris., and Don E. Fehrenbacher. ''The Impending Crisis, 1848–1861'', New York: Harper & Row, 1976</ref>

As Parker's early biographer John White Chadwick wrote, Parker was involved with almost all of the reform movements of the time: "peace, [[temperance movement|temperance]], education, the condition of women, penal legislation, [[prison reform|prison discipline]], the moral and mental destitution of the rich, the physical destitution of the poor" though none became "a dominant factor in his experience" with the exception of his antislavery views.<ref>Gura, Philip F.

[[Image:Cimitero degli inglesi, tomba Theodore Parker.JPG|thumb|Parker's tomb in Florence]]

Following a lifetime of overwork, Parker's ill health forced his retirement in 1859. He developed [[tuberculosis]], then without effective treatment, and departed for [[Florence]], Italy, where he died on May 10, 1860. He sought refuge in Florence because of his friendship with [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett]] and [[Robert Browning]], [[Isa Blagden]] and [[Frances Power Cobbe]], but died scarcely a month following his arrival. It was less than a year before the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]].

Parker was a patient of William Wesselhoeft, who practiced [[homeopathy]]. Wesselhoeft gave the oration at Parker's funeral.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homeoint.org/seror/biograph/wesselhoeft.htm|title=William Wesselhoeft (1794-1858) - Pioneers of homeopathy by T. L.

Parker's headstone by [[Joel Tanner Hart]] was later replaced by one by [[William Wetmore Story]].  The British writer [[Fanny Trollope]], also buried here, wrote the first anti-slavery novel and [[Richard Hildreth]] wrote the second.  Both books were used by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] for her antislavery novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852).

==Legacy and honors==
{{ulist

|2= The church in West Roxbury where Parker held his first pastorate (1837–1846) was renamed [http://www.tparkerchurch.org/ Theodore Parker Unitarian Universalist Church] in 1962. It retains this name today.
|3= [[Frances Power Cobbe|Frances P. Cobbe]] collected and published Parker's writings in 14 volumes.
|4= According to Unitarian clergyman [[John White Chadwick]], Parker made common use of the phrase, "A democracy—of all the people, by all the people, for all the people" in his letters and writing.<ref>{{Cite magazine |magazine=The American Monthly Review of Reviews |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7hCmMq85tOoC&q=Wycliffe+%22by+all+the+people+for+all+the+people%22&pg=PA336 |access-date=17 Aug 2022 |last1=Shaw |first1=Albert |year=1901 |title=A Letter from Mr. John White Chadwick|page=336}}</ref> It appears publicly in a speech by Parker at an 1850 anti-slavery convention.<ref name="Bartleby">{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/100/459.html |title=The American Idea:" speech at N.E.

Herndon]], Lincoln's law partner, witnessed Parker use the phrase in a July 4, 1858 address and claimed to have given Lincoln a copy, which Lincoln later used in formulating his [[Gettysburg Address]].<ref name="Bartleby"/> (Parker himself might have developed his phrase from [[John Wycliffe]]'s prologue to the first English translation of the Bible.)<ref>[[Wikiquote:John Wycliffe]]</ref>
|5= Parker predicted the inevitable success of the abolitionist cause this way:

<blockquote>I do not pretend to understand the moral universe; the arc is a long one, my eye reaches but little ways; I cannot calculate the curve and complete the figure by the experience of sight; I can divine it by conscience. And from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice.<ref>{{ cite web |last=Manker-Seale |first=Susan |title=The Moral Arc of the Universe: Bending Toward Justice |url=http://www.uucnwt.org/sermons/TheMoralArcOfTheUniverse%201-15-06.html |date=2006-01-15 |access-date=2008-02-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811220256/http://www.uucnwt.org/sermons/TheMoralArcOfTheUniverse%201-15-06.html |archive-date=2007-08-11 }}</ref></blockquote>

A century later, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] would paraphrase these words in a number of his [[Sermons and speeches of Martin Luther King Jr.|speeches and sermons]], including: a prepared statement he read in 1956 following the conclusion of the [[Montgomery bus boycott]];<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/statement-ending-bus-boycott |title=Statement on Ending the Bus Boycott (statement for Montgomery Improvement Association) |first1=Martin Luther Jr. |last1=King |author-link1=Martin Luther King Jr. |date=25 March 1965 |publisher=The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute, Stanford University |access-date=23 February 2017 |quote=There have been moments when roaring waters of disappointment poured upon us in staggering torrents.

|6=In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]]'s influential best seller, ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', believed to have sparked the 1960s and 70s women's movement, bore the following 1853 [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from Theodore Parker:

<blockquote>The domestic function of the woman does not exhaust her powers... To make one half of the human race consume its energies in the functions of housekeeper, wife and mother is a monstrous waste of the most precious material God ever made.</blockquote>

Eight months after the publication of Friedan's book, [[Kurt Vonnegut]] uses the same quote in his short story "Lovers Anonymous", first published in the October issue of ''Redbook'' magazine and reprinted in Vonnegut's 1999 collection ''Bagombo Snuff Box''.
|7= The beige rug chosen for President [[Barack Obama]]'s remodeled [[Oval Office]]  in August 2010, was bordered by five quotations, two of which (by Lincoln and King) are inspired by the writings of Parker, as noted above.<ref>{{ cite news |last=Stiehm |first=Jamie |title=Oval Office rug gets history wrong |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/03/AR2010090305100.html |date=2010-09-04 |access-date=2010-09-04 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref>
