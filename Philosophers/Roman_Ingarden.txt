'''Roman Witold Ingarden''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|n|ˈ|g|ɑːr|d|ən}}; 5 February 1893 – 14 June 1970) was a Polish [[philosopher]] who worked in [[aesthetics]], [[ontology]], and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

Before [[World War II]], Ingarden published his works mainly in the [[German language]] and in books and newspapers. During the war, he switched to [[Polish language|Polish]] out of solidarity with his homeland after the German invasion,<ref name=":3" /> and as a result, his major works in [[ontology]] went largely unnoticed and undetected by the wider world and philosophical community. Nevertheless, Ingarden's writings have made some indirect cultural impact through the writings of his student and eventual Pope, [[Karol Wojtyla]].

==Biography==
Ingarden was born in [[Kraków]], [[Austria-Hungary]], on February 5, 1893.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stein|first=Edith|title=Edith Stein: Letters to Roman Ingarden: Edith Stein: Self-Portrait in Letters; The Collected Works volume 12|publisher=ICS Publications|year=2014|isbn=978-1-939272-25-6|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=12}}</ref> He first studied [[mathematics]] and philosophy at the [[Jan Kazimierz University|Lwów University]] under [[Kazimierz Twardowski]], then moved to the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany  to study philosophy under [[Edmund Husserl]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Keith|title=New Research on the Philosophy of Nicolai Hartmann|last2=Poli|first2=Roberto|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG|year=2016|isbn=978-3-11-044102-4|location=Berlin|pages=171|language=en}}</ref> He was considered by Husserl to be one of his best and greatest students and accompanied Husserl to the [[University of Freiburg]], where, in 1918, Ingarden submitted his doctoral dissertation with Husserl as director.<ref name="leeds">{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ingarden/|title=Roman Ingarden (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|access-date=2015-12-04}}</ref> The title of his thesis was ''Intuition und Intellekt bei Henri Bergson'' (''Intuition and Intellect in Henri Bergson'').<ref name=":1" /> Ingarden previously suggested that he transfer to Lwów and write a new dissertation under Twardowski due to an increasing tension between Germany and Poland but Husserl refused and was uninterested.<ref name=":1" />

Ingarden then returned to Poland, where he spent his academic career after obtaining his doctorate. For a long period, he had to support himself by secondary-school teaching.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tymieniecka|first=Anna-Teresa|title=Phenomenology World-Wide: Foundations — Expanding Dynamics — Life-Engagements A Guide for Research and Study|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=978-94-007-0472-5|location=Dordrecht|pages=184}}</ref> During this period, one of his works - aside from his post-doctoral work in [[epistemology]] - was a review of the ''[[Festschrift]]'' written for Twardowski. This involved an analysis of Zygmunt Lempicki's "''W sprawie uzasadnienia poetyki czystej''" (On the Justification of Pure Poetics).<ref name=":0" />

In 1925 he submitted his ''[[Habilitationschrift]]'', ''Essentiale Fragen'' (''Essential Questions''), to Kazimierz Twardowski at [[Jan Kazimierz University|Lwów University]]. This thesis was noticed by the English-speaking philosophical community.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Porębski|first=Czesław|title=Lectures on Polish Value Theory|publisher=BRILL|year=2019|isbn=978-90-04-39432-2|location=Leiden|pages=125}}</ref><ref>See the review by Gilbert Ryle, ''Mind'', 36, 1927, pp. 366–370.</ref> In 1933, the university promoted him as professor of philosophy.<ref name=":2" /> He became well known for his work on ''The Literary Work of Art'' (''Das literarische Kunstwerk. Eine Untersuchung aus dem Grenzgebiet der Ontologie, Logik und Literaturwissenschaft'', 1931).<ref name="leeds" /> Particularly, interest in his works increased when the English translation of this text was released.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Ingarden|first1=Roman|title=The Work of Music: and the Problem of its Identity|last2=Czerniawski|first2=Adam|last3=Harrell|first3=Jean G.|publisher=Springer|year=1986|isbn=978-1-349-09254-3|location=Cham|pages=vii|language=en}}</ref>

From 1939 to 1941 during the Soviet occupation of Lwów he continued his university activity and lived in the Kraków area.<ref name=":2" /> After the [[Operation Barbarossa]] 1941 under the German occupation Ingarden secretly taught students [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]]. After his house was bombed, he continued work on his book, ''The Controversy over the Existence of the World''.<ref name="leeds"/>

Ingarden became a professor at [[Nicolaus Copernicus University]] in [[Toruń]] in 1945 shortly after the war but was banned in 1946 under the Communist regime.<ref name=":3" /> He then moved to the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków, where he was offered a position.<ref name=":2" /> In 1949, however, he was banned from teaching due to his alleged [[idealism]], supposedly being an "enemy of materialism".<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Ian|title=A Dictionary of Critical Theory|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-953291-9|location=Oxford|pages=247}}</ref> In 1957 he was reappointed at the Jagiellonian University after the ban was lifted, and so he went on to teach, write and publish.

Ingarden died on June 14, 1970, in Kraków as a result of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].<ref name="leeds" />

==Works==
Ingarden was a [[Realist phenomenology|realist phenomenologist]] and thus did not accept Husserl's [[transcendental idealism]]. His training was phenomenological; thus, his work as a whole was directed towards [[ontology]]. That is why{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Ingarden is one of the most renowned phenomenological ontologists, as he strove to describe the ontological structure and state of being of various objects based on the essential features of any experience that could provide such knowledge.

The best-known works of Ingarden, and the only ones widely-known to English-speaking readers, concern [[aesthetics]] and [[literature]]. His most popular book, for instance, was ''The Literary Work of Art,'' which explored the [[concept]] of the literary [[work of art]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Dziemidok|first1=Bohdan|title=On the Aesthetics of Roman Ingarden: Interpretations and Assessments|last2=McCormick|first2=Peter|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=1989|isbn=978-94-010-7511-4|location=Dordrecht|pages=13, 101}}</ref> In this book, Ingarden argued that a literary work of art is a purely [[Object of the mind|intentional object]] and is a product of the author's [[conscious]] acts.<ref name=":0" /> This work would contribute to the development of the [[literary theory]] called [[reader-response criticism]] and influence scholars such as [[René Wellek]] and [[Wolfgang Iser]].<ref name=":3" /> Another notable notion in Ingarden's aesthetics was his idea that music is not a form of literature. He maintained that literary works have four distinct ontological strata, and one of these - the stratum of represented objectivities - is absent in musical works.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Elsby|first1=Charlene|title=Essays on Aesthetic Genesis|last2=Massecar|first2=Aaron|publisher=University Press of America|year=2016|isbn=978-0-7618-6769-2|location=Lanham, MD|pages=88|language=en}}</ref> In his stratification of literary work of art, he cited that aesthetic value is the polyphonic harmony that arises between these strata of meaning.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Stephen|title=A Companion to Aesthetics|last2=Higgins|first2=Kathleen Marie|last3=Hopkins|first3=Robert|last4=Stecker|first4=Robert|last5=Cooper|first5=David E.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4443-1042-9|location=Malden, MA|pages=56|language=en}}</ref>

The exclusive focus on Ingarden's work in [[aesthetics]] does not reflect Ingarden's overall philosophical standpoint, which is focused on the ideas regarding [[formal ontology|formal]], [[existential]], and [[Materiality (social sciences and humanities)|material ontology]] set forth in his ''The Controversy over the Existence of the World''. In his aesthetic investigations, Ingarden considered aesthetics as an integral part of philosophy. He argued that his aesthetic theory is not only an [[analysis]] of art but an approach that answers basic philosophical issues.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tymieniecka|first=Anna-Teresa|title=Phenomenology of Life in a Dialogue Between Chinese and Occidental Philosophy, Volume XVII|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|year=2012|isbn=978-94-009-6262-0|location=Dordrecht|pages=271}}</ref> Ingarden also attempted to establish a phenomenological circle at Lvov. The group, which focused on aesthetics and [[descriptive psychology]], attracted some of Twardowski's students including Leopold Blaustein and [[Eugénie Ginsberg]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Poli|first=Roberto|title=In Itinere: European Cities and the Birth of Modern Scientific Philosophy|publisher=Rodopi|year=1997|isbn=90-420-0201-8|location=Amsterdam|pages=173|language=en}}</ref> Ingarden was a close associate of [[Edith Stein]]. He came to her defense when her work with Husserl was challenged.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stein|first=Edith|title=Life in a Jewish Family: An Autobiography, 1891-1916 (The Collected Works of Edith Stein, vol. 1)|date=2017-11-24|publisher=ICS Publications|isbn=978-1-939272-46-1|language=en}}</ref>

Ingarden wrote his own biography in 1949. This work, which was written in third person, was one of the three biographies he submitted to Tatarkiewicz, who was then revising his ''Historia filozofii'' (History of philosophy).<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Mitscherling|first=Jeffrey Anthony|title=Roman Ingarden's Ontology and Aesthetics|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|year=1997|isbn=0-7766-0435-X|location=Ottawa|pages=16, 31}}</ref> The philosopher had also undertaken work for Husserl.<ref name=":1" />
