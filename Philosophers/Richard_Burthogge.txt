'''Richard Burthogge''' (1637/38–1705) (''alias'' Borthoge, Burthog, [[List of Latinized names|Latinized]] to ''Burthoggius'') of [[Devon]], England, was a [[physician]], [[magistrate]] and [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Richard Burthogge was the son of a Captain of [[Infantry|Foot]] at the garrison of [[Plymouth]], and was baptised in Plympton St Maurice on 30 January 1637 (OS; 1638 by Modern Style). He attended [[Exeter Grammar School]],<ref name = CDNB>''Concise Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> was admitted to [[All Souls College, Oxford]], as a servitor in 1654, migrated to [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], and graduated B.A. "completed by determination" in 1658.<ref>	Anthony à Wood, Athenae Oxonienses, Vol. IV, p. 581</ref> He matriculated at the [[University of Leiden]] in October 1661. His doctoral thesis was entitled "''De lithiasi et calculo''" and submitted on 27 February 1662. 

Back in England, Burthogge practiced medicine in and near [[Totnes]]. He spent many years at [[Bowden, Ashprington|Bowden House]], [[Ashprington]], near Totnes, which belonged to his sister’s husband Edward Giles. Unprejudiced even against Catholics and probably himself a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Non-Conformist]], he was made a [[Justice of the Peace]] under King [[James II of England|James II]], a position he retained under King [[William III of England|William III]].

Burthogge married at least three times. His first wife was Sarah Trevill,<ref name="The Totnes Times, 31 March 1928">The Totnes Times, 31 March 1928</ref> the daughter of Andrew Trevill, to whom he dedicated ''The Divine Goodness'' in 1670 and his ''Organum Vetus et Novum'' in 1678. In the following years, when  married to Mary Deeble,<ref name="The Totnes Times, 31 March 1928"/> Burthogge published several other works on religious subjects and two further philosophical works, both dedicated to [[John Locke]]: ''An Essay upon Reason, and the Nature of Spirits'' (1694) and ''Of the Soul of the World; and of Particular Souls'' (1699). Mary Deeble probably died in 1695. His daughters Sarah, Mary and Ann originated from these first two marriages. Ann Burthogge, who predeceased her father, left a young son, Richard Babbage, ancestor of the computer pioneer [[Charles Babbage]]. At the time of his death Burthogge was married to Honour and seems to have lived at Bowden. He died in 1705 and was buried at St. Mary’s church, Totnes, on 24 July 1705.<ref>Dictionary of National Biography</ref>

==Opinions==
In his philosophical and theological writings he was a critic in some respects of [[John Locke]], but generally his supporter, and an advocate of [[religious toleration]]. His [[epistemology]] was [[empiricist]], and he opposed [[innate idea]]s. His [[metaphysics]] was distinctive, but not completely worked out.<ref name = Pyle>[[Andrew Pyle (philosopher)|Andrew Pyle]] (editor), ''Dictionary of Seventeenth-Century British Philosophers'' (2000), article ''Burthogge, Richard'', pp. 147-150.</ref>
