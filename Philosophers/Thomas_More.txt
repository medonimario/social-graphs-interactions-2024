More opposed the [[Protestant Reformation]], directing polemics against the theology of [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[William Tyndale]]. More also opposed Henry VIII's separation from the Catholic Church, refusing to acknowledge Henry as [[supreme head of the Church of England]] and the annulment of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]].

== Early life ==

{{Catholic philosophy}}
Born on [[Milk Street, London|Milk Street]] in the [[City of London]], on 7 February 1478, Thomas More was the son of [[Sir John More]],<ref>Jokinen, A. (13 June 2009). [http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/morebio.htm "The Life of Sir Thomas More."] Luminarium. Retrieved 19 September 2011.</ref> a successful lawyer and later a judge,<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |last1=Glenn |first1=Garrard |title=St. Thomas More As Judge and lawyer |journal=Fordham Law Review |date=1 January 1941 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=187 |url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol10/iss2/2/}}</ref>{{sfn|House|2008|loc=More, Sir Thomas}} and his wife Agnes (''née'' Graunger). He was the second of six children. More was educated at [[St. Anthony's Hospital, St Benet Fink|St. Anthony's School]], then considered one of London's best schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/thomas-more-9414278|title=Sir Thomas More|work=The Biography Channel website|year=2014|access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tudortimes.co.uk/people/thomas-more-always-a-londoner |title=Thomas More: Always a Londoner |website=tudortimes.co.uk |date=24 September 2016 |access-date=1 May 2019}}</ref> From 1490 to 1492, More served [[John Morton (cardinal)|John Morton]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and Lord Chancellor of England, as a household page.<ref name="Rebhorn">{{cite book|editor-last=Rebhorn|editor-first=Wayne A|title=Utopia|place=New York|publisher=Barnes & Noble|series=Classics|year=2005|chapter=Introduction}}.</ref>{{rp|xvi}}

Morton enthusiastically supported the "[[New Learning]]" (scholarship which was later known as "humanism" or "London humanism"), and thought highly of the young More. Believing that More had great potential, Morton nominated him for a place at the [[University of Oxford]], either in [[St. Mary Hall]] or [[Canterbury College, Oxford|Canterbury College]], both now defunct.<ref name="Ackroyd">{{cite book|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|title=The Life of Thomas More|place=New York|publisher=Anchor Books|year=1999}}.</ref>{{rp|38}}

More began his studies at Oxford in 1492, and received a classical education. Studying under [[Thomas Linacre]] and [[William Grocyn]], he became proficient in both Latin and Greek. More left Oxford after only two years—at his father's insistence—to begin legal training in London at New Inn, one of the [[Inns of Chancery]].<ref name="Rebhorn" />{{rp|xvii}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Harpsfield|first=Nicholas|title=The Life and Death of Sr Thomas More|place=London|publisher=Early English Text Society|year=1931|pages=12–3}}</ref> In 1496, More became a student at [[Lincoln's Inn]], one of the [[Inns of Court]], where he remained until 1502, when he was [[called to the Bar]].<ref name="Rebhorn" />{{rp|xvii}}

More could speak and banter in Latin with the same facility as in English.  He wrote and translated poetry.<ref>{{cite book |last1=More |first1=Sir Thomas |title=Delphi Collected Works of Sir Thomas More (Illustrated) |date=10 December 2018 |publisher=Delphi Classics |isbn=978-1-78877-995-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVN-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT2287 |access-date=28 August 2023 |language=en}}</ref> He was particularly influenced by [[Pico della Mirandola]] and translated the ''Life of Pico'' into English.<ref name=Seebohm/>

== Spiritual life ==
According to his friend, the theologian [[Desiderius Erasmus]] of [[Rotterdam]], More once seriously contemplated abandoning his legal career to become a [[monk]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Erasmus|first=Desiderius|author-link=Desiderius Erasmus|contribution=Letter to Ulrich von Hutten|editor-last=Adams|editor-first=Robert M.|title=Utopia|year=1991|url=https://archive.org/details/utopiarevisedtra00more|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=WW Norton & Co|page=[https://archive.org/details/utopiarevisedtra00more/page/125 125]|isbn=9780393961454}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Erasmus to Ulrich von Hutten|work=The Center for Thomas More Studies. Biographical Accounts: Erasmus' Letters about More|url=https://thomasmorestudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Erasmus-to-Ulrich-von-Hutten.pdf}}</ref> Between 1503 and 1504 More lived near the [[London Charterhouse|Carthusian monastery]] outside the walls of London and joined in the monks' spiritual exercises. Although he deeply admired their piety, More ultimately decided to remain a layman, standing for election to Parliament in 1504 and marrying the following year.<ref name="Rebhorn" />{{rp |xxi}}

More continued ascetic practices for the rest of his life, such as wearing a [[hair shirt]] next to his skin and occasionally engaging in [[self-flagellation]].<ref name="Rebhorn" />{{rp |xxi}} A tradition of the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]] honours More as a member of that Order on their [[calendar of saints]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taucrossregion.org/calendarfranciscansaints.htm|work=Tau Cross Region of the Secular Franciscan Order|title=Franciscan Calendar|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505201117/http://www.taucrossregion.org/calendarfranciscansaints.htm|archive-date=5 May 2013}}</ref>

More married Joanna "Jane" Colt, the eldest daughter of John Colt of Essex in 1505.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=More, Sir Thomas |volume=18 |page=824 |first=Mark |last=Pattison |authorlink=Mark Pattison (academic)}}</ref> In that year he leased a portion of a house known as the Old Barge (originally there had been a wharf nearby serving the [[River Walbrook|Walbrook river]]) on Bucklersbury, [[St Stephen Walbrook]] parish, London.

Jane died in 1511.<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp |132}}

Going "against friends' advice and common custom," within 30 days, More had married one of the many eligible women among his wide circle of friends.<ref name= Wegemer>{{cite book|title=Thomas More: A Portrait of Courage| first= Gerard B. |last= Wegemer| year=1995|publisher=Scepter Publishing}}</ref><ref name= Wagner>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_c_md3gMpwC |title=Encyclopedia of Tudor England |first1= John A.|last1= Wagner |first2= Susan |last2= Walters Schmid |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-59884-299-9 |pages=769–770}}</ref> He chose [[Alice More|Alice Middleton]], a widow, to head his household and care for his small children.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last= Maddison| editor-first= The Rev.

More had no children from his second marriage, although he raised Alice's daughter from her previous marriage as his own. More also became the guardian of two young girls: Anne Cresacre who would eventually marry his son, John More;<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|146}} and [[Margaret Giggs]] (later Clement) who was the only member of his family to witness his execution (she died on the 35th anniversary of that execution, and her daughter married More's nephew [[William Rastell]]). An affectionate father, More wrote letters to his children whenever he was away on legal or government business, and encouraged them to write to him often.<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|150}}<ref name="Rogers">{{cite book|editor-last=Rogers|editor-first= Elizabeth Frances|first= Thomas|last=More|title=Selected Letters|url=https://archive.org/details/utopia00lumbgoog|place=New Haven and London| publisher= Yale University Press|year=1961}}.</ref>{{rp|xiv}}

More insisted upon giving his daughters the same classical education as his son, an unusual attitude at the time.<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp |146–47}} His eldest daughter, Margaret, attracted much admiration for her erudition, especially her fluency in Greek and Latin.<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|147}} More told his daughter of his pride in her academic accomplishments in September 1522, after he showed the bishop a letter she had written:

{{blockquote|When he saw from the signature that it was the letter of a lady, his surprise led him to read it more eagerly ... he said he would never have believed it to be your work unless I had assured him of the fact, and he began to praise it in the highest terms ... for its pure Latinity, its correctness, its erudition, and its expressions of tender affection. He took out at once from his pocket a portague [A Portuguese gold coin] ... to send to you as a pledge and token of his good will towards you.<ref name="Rogers" />{{rp|152}}}}

More's decision to educate his daughters set an example for other noble families. Even Erasmus became much more favourable once he witnessed their accomplishments.<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|149}}

A large portrait of More and his extended family, [[Sir Thomas More and Family]], was painted by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]]; however, it was lost in a fire in the 18th century. More's grandson commissioned a copy, of which two versions survive. The Nostell copy of the portrait shown above also includes the family's two pet dogs and monkey.<ref group=note>Erasmus wrote about this monkey in his Colloquy [[Colloquies#Amicitia (Friendship)|Amicitia]].</ref>

Musical instruments such as a lute and viol feature in the background of the extant copies of Holbein's family portrait. More played the recorder and [[viol]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bryan |first1=John |title=Extended Play: Reflections of Heinrich Isaac's Music in Early Tudor England |journal=The Journal of Musicology |date=January 2011 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=118–141 |doi=10.1525/jm.2011.28.1.118 |s2cid=18594216 |url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/10511/ |language=en |issn=0277-9269}}</ref>{{rp|136}} and made sure his wives could join in the family consort.<ref group="note">"Sir Thomas More's first wife was instructed 'in learning and every kind of music'; his second wife, in middle age, was induced 'to learn to play apon the gittern, the lute, the clavichord and the recorders.'" {{cite book |last1=Stevens |first1=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mos4AAAAIAAJ |title=Music & Poetry in the Early Tudor Court |date=1961 |publisher=CUP Archive |language=en}}, p 276</ref>

== Personality according to Erasmus ==
Concerning More's personality, [[Erasmus]] gave a consistent portrait over a period of thirty five years.

Soon after meeting the young lawyer More, who became his best friend{{refn|group=note|Victorian biographer Seebohm commented "Along with great intellectual gifts was combined in the young student (More) a gentle and loving disposition, which threw itself into the bosom of a friend with so guileless and pure an affection, that when men came under the power of its unconscious enchantment they literally ''fell in love'' with More."<ref name=Seebohm>{{cite book |last1=Seebohm |first1=Frederic |title=The Oxford Reformers. John Colet, Erasmus and Thomas More |date=1869 |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co |edition=3rd |url=https://reformationchurch.org.uk/book_oxford-reformers_seebohm.php}}</ref>}} and invited Erasmus into his household,  Erasmus reported in 1500 "Did nature ever invent anything kinder, sweeter or more harmonious than the character of Thomas More?".<ref name="BS">{{cite journal |last1=Baker-Smith |first1=Dominic |title=Erasmus and More: A Friendship Revisited |journal=Recusant History |date=May 2010 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=7–25 |doi=10.1017/S0034193200012607|s2cid=164968766 }}</ref>  In 1519, he wrote that More was "born and designed for friendship;<ref group=note>"More held that the experience of friendship is a partial anticipation of the secure friendship of heaven, where we may hope that all will "be merry together"-not just our friends in this life but our enemies too." {{cite journal |last1=McEvoy |first1=James |title=The Theory of Friendship in Erasmus and Thomas More |journal=American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly |date=2006 |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=227–252 |doi=10.5840/acpq200680243}}</ref> no one is more open-hearted in making friends or more tenacious in keeping them."<ref>{{cite web |title=Brethren of the Christian humanist life, Christian History Magazine |url=https://christianhistoryinstitute.org/magazine/article/ch-145-thomas-more-and-erasmus |website=Christian History Institute |access-date=29 July 2023 |language=en}}</ref> In 1535, after More's execution, Erasmus wrote that More "never bore ill-intent towards anyone".<ref name="BS"/>

In a 1532 letter, Erasmus wrote "such is the kindliness of his disposition, or rather, to say it better, such is his piety and wisdom, that whatever comes his way that cannot be corrected, he comes to love just as wholeheartedly as if nothing better could have happened to him."<ref>Erasmus to John Faber (later Bishop of Vienna), 1532</ref>

In a 1533 letter, Erasmus described More's character as ''imperiosus'' – commanding, far-ruling, not at all timid.<ref>Erasmus to Conrad Goclenius (Chair of Latin, Louvain), 2 September 1535</ref>

For his part, "Thomas More was an unflagging apologist for Erasmus for the thirty-six years of their adult lives (1499–1535)."<ref name="Thomas More: First and Best Apologi">{{cite journal |last1=Scheck |first1=Thomas P. |title=Thomas More: First and Best Apologist for Erasmus |journal=Moreana |date=June 2021 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=75–111 |doi=10.3366/more.2021.0093|s2cid=236358666 }}</ref>

== Early political career ==
[[File:Study for portrait of the More family, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Study for a portrait of Thomas More's family, {{Circa|1527}}, by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]

In 1504 More was elected to Parliament to represent [[Great Yarmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Yarmouth]], and in 1510 began representing [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/more-thomas-i-147778-1535| title=History of Parliament| publisher=History of Parliament Trust|access-date=13 October 2011}}</ref>

More first attracted public attention by his conduct in the parliament of 1504, by his daring opposition to the king's demand for money. [[King Henry VII]] was entitled, according to feudal laws, to a grant on occasion of his daughter [[Margaret Tudor]]'s marriage to [[James IV of Scotland]].<ref>Richard S. Sylvester & Davis P. Harding, ''Two Early Tudor Lives'' (Yale, 1962), pp. xvi, 199.</ref> But he came to the House of Commons for a much larger sum than he intended to give with his daughter. The members, unwilling as they were to vote the money, were afraid to offend the king, till the silence was broken by More, whose speech is said to have moved the house to reduce the subsidy of three-fifteenths which the Government had demanded to £30,000. One of the chamberlains went and told his master that he had been thwarted by a beardless boy. Henry never forgave the audacity; but, for the moment, the only revenge he could take was upon More's father, whom upon some pretext he threw into the Tower, and he only released him upon payment of a fine of £100. Thomas More even found it advisable to withdraw from public life into obscurity.<ref name=EB1911/>

From 1510, More served as one of the two [[undersheriff]]s of the [[City of London]], a position of considerable responsibility in which he earned a reputation as an honest and effective public servant. Interested in public health, he became a Commissioner for Sewers in 1514.<ref name=Krivatsy>{{cite journal |last1=Krivatsy |first1=Peter |title=Erasmus' Medical Milieu |journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine |date=1973 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=113–154 |jstor=44447526 |pmid=4584234 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44447526 |access-date=28 July 2023 |issn=0007-5140}}</ref> More became [[Master of Requests (England)|Master of Requests]] in 1514,<ref>Magnusson (ed.)

As secretary and personal adviser to [[King Henry VIII]], More became increasingly influential: welcoming foreign diplomats, drafting official documents, attending the court of the [[Star Chamber]] for his legal prowess but delegated to judge in the under-court for 'poor man's cases'<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Guy |first1=J. A. |title=Wolsey, the Council and the Council Courts |journal=The English Historical Review |date=1976 |volume=91 |issue=360 |pages=481–505 |doi=10.1093/ehr/XCI.CCCLX.481 |jstor=566623 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/566623 |issn=0013-8266}}</ref>{{rp|491,492}} and serving as a liaison between the King and Lord Chancellor Wolsey. More later served as [[High Steward (academia)|High Steward]] for the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

In 1523 More was elected as [[knight of the shire]] (MP) for [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]] and, on Wolsey's recommendation, the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] elected More its [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker]].<ref name=rebhorn /> In 1525 More became [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], with executive and judicial responsibilities over much of northern England.<ref name="rebhorn" />

After [[Wolsey]] fell, More succeeded to the office of [[Lord Chancellor]] (the [[List of English chief ministers|chief government minister]]) in 1529; this was the highest official responsible for equity and common law, including contracts and royal household cases, and some misdemeanour appeals.<ref name=pollard>{{cite journal |last1=Pollard |first1=A.

=== Campaign against the Protestant Reformation ===
[[File:HouseOfMore.JPG|thumb|Sir Thomas More is commemorated with a sculpture at the late-19th-century Sir Thomas More House, [[Carey Street]], London, opposite the [[Royal Courts of Justice]].]]
More supported the [[Catholic Church]] and saw the [[Protestant Reformation]] as [[heresy]], a threat to the unity of both church and society. More believed in the theology, argumentation, and ecclesiastical laws of the church, and "heard Luther's call to destroy the Catholic Church as a call to war."<ref name="Gerard">Gerard B. Wegemer, ''Portrait of Courage'', p. 136.</ref>

{{blockquote|Heresy was the single most time-consuming issue Thomas More dealt with in his chancellorship, and probably in the whole of the last ten years of his life.|[[Richard Rex]], ''More and the heretics: statesman or fanatic?''<ref name=rex/>{{rp|107}}}}

More wrote a series of books and pamphlets in English and Latin to respond to Protestants, and in his official capacities took action against the illegal book trade, notably fronting a diplomatically-sensitive raid in 1525 of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic Merchants]] in the [[Steelyard]] in role as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster<ref name=rex />{{rp|106}} and given his diplomatic experience negotiating with the Hanse.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Colvin |first1=Ian Duncan |title=The Germans in England, 1066–1598 |date=1915 |publisher=Associated Faculty Press, Incorporated |location=London |isbn=978-0-8046-1213-5 |language=en}}</ref>{{rp|150}}

====Debates with Tyndale====
More wrote several books against the first edition of [[William Tyndale|Tyndale's]] [[Tyndale Bible|English translation of the New Testament]]:.{{sfn|Mueller|Loewenstein|2002|p=93, (footnote 36)}} More wrote the ''Dialogue concerning Heresies'' (1529), Tyndale responded with ''An Answer to Sir T. More's Dialogue'' (1530), and More replied with his ''Confutation of Tyndale's Answer'' (1532).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chuilleanáin |first1=Eiléan Ní |title=The Debate Between Thomas More and William Tyndale, 1528–33: Ideas on Literature and Religion |journal=The Journal of Ecclesiastical History |date=July 1988 |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=382–411 |doi=10.1017/S0022046900038392|s2cid=163326083 }}</ref> More also wrote or contributed to several other anti-Lutheran books.

One of More's criticisms of the initial Tyndale translation was that despite claiming to be in the vernacular, Tyndale had employed numerous neologisms: for example, "Jehovah", "scapegoat", "Passover", "atonement", "mercy seat", "shewbread."<ref>{{cite web |title=Words "Fitly Spoken": Tyndale's English Translation of the Bible {{!}} Religious Studies Center |url=https://rsc.byu.edu/prelude-restoration/words-fitly-spoken-tyndales-english-translation-bible |website=rsc.byu.edu |access-date=30 July 2023}}</ref> More also accused Tyndale of deliberately avoiding common translations in favour of biased words: such as using the emotion "love" instead of the practical action "charity" for Greek {{lang|grc|agape}}, using the neologism ''senior'' instead of "priest" for the Greek {{lang|grc|presbyteros}}{{sfn|Hiscock|Wilcox|2017|p=547}} (Tyndale changed this to "elder"), and the latinate "congregation" instead of "church".<ref>{{cite web |title=William Tyndale's Concept of the Church {{!}} Christian Library |url=https://www.christianstudylibrary.org/article/william-tyndales-concept-church |website=www.christianstudylibrary.org |access-date=30 July 2023}}</ref> Tyndale's bibles include text other than the scriptures: some of Tyndale's prefaces were direct translations of Martin Luther,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Collinson |first1=Patrick |title=William Tyndale and the Course of the English Reformation |journal=Reformation |date=January 1996 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=72–97 |doi=10.1179/ref_1996_1_1_007}}</ref> and it included marginal glosses which challenged Catholic doctrine.{{sfn|Moynahan|2014|p=}}

One notable exchange occurred over More's attack on Tyndale's use of ''congregation''. Tyndale pointed out that he was following "your darling" Erasmus' Latin translation of ''ecclesia'' by ''congregatio.'' More replied that Erasmus needed to coin ''congregatio'' because there was no good Latin word, while English had the perfectly fine "church", but that the intent and theology under the words were all important:

{{blockquote |I have not contended with Erasmus my darling, because I found no such malicious intent with Erasmus my darling, as I find with Tyndale. For had I found with Erasmus my darling the cunning intent and purpose that I find in Tyndale: Erasmus my darling should be no more my darling. But I find in Erasmus my darling that he detests and abhors the errors and heresies that Tyndale plainly teaches and abides by and therefore Erasmus my darling shall be my dear darling still. And surely if Tyndale had either never taught them, or yet had the grace to revoke them: then should Tyndale be my dear darling too.

=== Resignation ===
As the conflict over supremacy between the Papacy and the King reached its peak, More continued to remain steadfast in supporting the [[Papal supremacy|supremacy of the Pope]] as [[Apostolic succession|Successor of Peter]] over that of the King of England. Parliament's reinstatement of the charge of [[praemunire]] in 1529 had made it a crime to support in public or office the claim of any authority outside the realm (such as the Papacy) to have a legal jurisdiction superior to the King's.<ref name="Kelly_xiv"/>

In 1530, More refused to sign a letter by the leading English churchmen and aristocrats asking [[Pope Clement VII]] to [[Declaration of nullity|annul]] Henry's marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], and also quarrelled with Henry VIII over the heresy laws. In 1531, a royal decree required the clergy to take an [[English post-Reformation oaths|oath acknowledging the King]] as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. The bishops at the [[Convocation of Canterbury]] in 1532 agreed to sign the Oath but only under threat of praemunire and only after these words were added: "as far as the law of Christ allows".<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Tanner |editor1-first= Joseph Robson |title=Tudor Constitutional Documents: A.

Henry purged most clergy who supported the papal stance from senior positions in the church. More continued to refuse to sign the Oath of Supremacy and did not agree to support the annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine.<ref name="Kelly_xiv"/> However, he did not openly reject the King's actions and kept his opinions private.<ref name= "Richards8"/>

On 16 May 1532, More resigned from his role as Chancellor but remained in Henry's favour despite his refusal.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=31uoDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT23 |title= Defending Royal Supremacy and Discerning God's Will in Tudor England |author=Daniel Eppley |publisher=Routledge |year=2016 |isbn= 978-1-351-94579-0 |page=13}}</ref> His decision to resign was caused by the decision of the convocation of the English Church, which was under intense royal threat, on the day before.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=y5rDAyEoHyAC&pg=PA116 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Thomas More |editor=George M.

== Controversy on extent of prosecution of heretics ==
There is considerable variation in opinion on the extent and nature of More's prosecution of heretics: witness the difference in portrayals of More in [[A Man for All Seasons (play)|A Man for All Seasons]] and in [[Wolf Hall]].{{clarify|the difference needs to be stated|date=September 2024}} The English establishment initially regarded [[Protestants]] (and [[Münster rebellion|Anabaptists]]) as akin to the [[Peasants' Revolt|Lollards]] and [[Hussites#Hussite Wars (1419–1434)|Hussites]] whose heresies fed their sedition.<ref group=note>The intertwining of sedition and heresy can be seen in [[Henry VIII]]'s pronouncement about the Lutherans' heresy "tending principally and chiefly to the withdrawing of the obedience of the Church of Rome, and also of the governance, regyment and supreme dignity of Princes and all nobility." Luther's attacks on German princes were evidence of the seditious nature of his doctrine. {{cite journal |last1=Baker House |first1=Seymour |title=Richard Rex, ed., Henry VIII and Martin Luther: The Second Controversy, 1525–1527 |journal=Moreana |date=December 2022 |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=254–269 |doi=10.3366/more.2022.0130|s2cid=254358434 }} Even 150 years later, "one of the assumptions that [[John Locke]] had to deal with in arguing for religious tolerance was that religious assemblies other than those sponsored by the established church invariably gave rise to sedition" {{cite journal |last1=Manning |first1=Roger B. |title=The Origins of the Doctrine of Sedition |journal=Albion |date=1980 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=99–121 |doi=10.2307/4048812|jstor=4048812 }}</ref>  Ambassador to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Cuthbert Tunstall]] called [[Lutheranism]] the "foster-child" of the Wycliffite heresy<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/statutes.html |title=Documents on the changing status of the English Vernacular, 1500–1540 |access-date=11 March 2008 |publisher=RIC |last=Potter |first=R.}}</ref> that had underpinned [[Lollardy]].

Historian [[Richard Rex]] wrote:<ref name=rex/>{{rp|106}}

=== Torture allegations ===
Torture was not officially legal in England, except in pre-trial discovery phase<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hanson |first1=Elizabeth |title=Torture and Truth in Renaissance England |journal=Representations |date=1991 |issue=34 |pages=53–84 |doi=10.2307/2928770 |jstor=2928770 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2928770 |issn=0734-6018}}</ref>{{rp|62}} of kinds of extreme cases that the King had allowed, such as seditious heresy. It was regarded as unsafe for evidence, and was not an allowed punishment.

Stories emerged in More's lifetime regarding persecution of the Protestant "heretics" during his time as [[Lord Chancellor]], and he denied them in detail in his ''Apologia'' (1533).

Many stories were later published by the sixteenth-century English Protestant historian [[John Foxe]] in his polemical ''[[Book of Martyrs]].'' [[John Foxe|Foxe]] was instrumental in publicizing accusations of torture, alleging that More had often personally used violence or torture while interrogating heretics.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rex |first1=Richard |author1-link=Richard Rex |editor1-last=Logan |editor1-first=George M. |title=The Cambridge Companion to Thomas More |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-82848-2 |page=93}}</ref> Later Protestant authors such as [[Brian Moynahan]] and [[Michael Farris (lawyer)|Michael Farris]] cite Foxe when repeating these allegations.<ref>{{cite journal|first= Michael| last= Farris | title = From Tyndale to Madison|year=2007}}</ref> Biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] also lists claims from Foxe's ''Book of Martyrs'' and other post-Reformation sources that More "tied heretics to a tree in his Chelsea garden and whipped them", that "he watched as 'newe men' were put upon the rack in the Tower and tortured until they confessed", and that "he was personally responsible for the burning of several of the 'brethren' in Smithfield."<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp |305}} <!-- However, the rack was not introduced to England until after More's death, wasn't it, apart from one unusual case? -->

More himself denied these allegations:

{{blockquote|Stories of a similar nature were current even in More's lifetime and he denied them forcefully.

'as help me God.'<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp |298–299}}}}

More instead claimed in his "Apology" (1533) that he only applied corporal punishment to two "heretics": a child servant in his household who was caned (the customary punishment for children at that time) for repeating a heresy regarding the Eucharist, and a "feeble-minded" man who was whipped for disrupting the mass by raising women's skirts over their heads at the moment of consecration, More taking the action to prevent a lynching.<ref name="Marius">Marius, Richard (1999).

=== Executions ===
Burning at the stake was the standard punishment by the English state for obstinate or relapsed, major seditious or proselytizing heresy, and continued to be used by both Catholics and Protestants during the religious upheaval of the following decades.<ref>Guy, John A. ''Tudor England'' Oxford, 1988. p 26</ref>  In England, following the [[Lollard]] uprisings, heresy had been linked to sedition (see [[De heretico comburendo]] and [[Suppression of Heresy Act 1414]].)

Historian [[Brian Moynahan]] alleged that More influenced the eventual execution of [[William Tyndale]] in the Duchy of Brabant, as English agents had long pursued Tyndale. He named Henry Phillips, a student at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]] and follower of Bishop Stokesley, as the man More commissioned to befriend Tyndale and then betray him.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moynahan |first1=Brian |author1-link=Brian Moynahan |title=If God spare my life: William Tyndale, the English Bible and Sir Thomas More-- a story of martyrdom and betrayal |date=2002 |publisher=Little, Brown |location=London |isbn=0-316-86092-1 |pages=325–328, 340}}</ref> This was notwithstanding that the execution took place on 6 October 1536, sixteen months after More himself had been executed, and in a different jurisdiction.

=== Modern treatment ===
Modern commentators have been divided over More's character and actions.

Some biographers, including Peter Ackroyd, have taken a relatively tolerant<ref group=note name=Ackroyd-ch22a>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8J9uNOydymUC&q=burned+as+there+was+neuer+wretche+I+wene+better+worthy |title=The Life of Thomas More |author=Peter Ackroyd |author-link=Peter Ackroyd |publisher=Chatto & Windus |year=1998 |page=244 |isbn=1-85619-711-5 |quote=(Chapter 22) ... Already, in these early days of English heresy, he was thinking of the fire. It is a measure of his alarm at the erosion of the traditional order that he should, in this letter, compose a defence of scholastic theology—the same scholasticism which in his younger days he had treated with derision. This was no longer a time for questioning, or innovation, or uncertainty, of any kind. He blamed Luther for the Peasants' Revolt in Germany, and maintained that all its havoc and destruction were the direct result of Luther's challenge to the authority of the Church; under the pretext of 'libertas' Luther preached 'licentia' which had in turn led to rape, sacrilege, bloodshed, fire and ruin. }} (Online citation [https://1000vampirenovels.com/pdf-novels/the-life-of-thomas-more-by-peter-ackroyd-free/47-page here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927204114/https://1000vampirenovels.com/pdf-novels/the-life-of-thomas-more-by-peter-ackroyd-free/47-page |date=27 September 2018 }})</ref> or even positive<ref group=note name=JoannePaul2016a >{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KN2qDQAAQBAJ&q=%22thomas+more%22+german+peasants+Revolt&pg=PT140 |title=Thomas More |author=Joanne Paul|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2016 |isbn=978-0-7456-9220-3|quote=Princes were 'driven by necessity' by the 'importune malice of heretics raising rebellions' to set 'sorer and sorer punishments thereunto' (CTA, 956).

[[Pope John Paul II]] honoured him by making More  [[patron saint]] of statesmen and politicians in October 2000, stating: "It can be said that he demonstrated in a singular way the value of a moral conscience ... even if, in his actions against heretics, he reflected the limits of the culture of his time".<ref name=JP2PatronSaint />

[[Australian High Court]] judge and President of the [[International Commission of Jurists]], Justice [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] has noted
{{Blockquote|More's resignation as Lord Chancellor demonstrates also a recognition of the fact that, so long as he held office, he was obliged to conform to the King's law. It is often the fact that judges and lawyers must perform acts which they do not particularly like. In Utopia, for example, More had written that he believed capital punishment to be immoral, reprehensible and unjustifiable. Yet as Lord Chancellor and as councillor to the King, he certainly participated in sending hundreds of people to their death, a troubling thought. Doubtless he saw himself, as many judges before and since have done, as a mere instrument of the legal power of the State.

== Indictment, trial and execution ==
In 1533, More refused to attend [[Coronation of Anne Boleyn|the coronation]] of [[Anne Boleyn]] as [[List of English royal consorts|Queen of England]]. Technically, this was not an act of treason, as More had written to Henry seemingly acknowledging Anne's queenship and expressing his desire for the King's happiness and the new Queen's health.<ref group=note>{{Citation | author-link = Eric Ives| first = Eric W | last = Ives | title = The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn | year = 2004 | page = 47 | quote = [More wrote on the subject of the Boleyn marriage that] [I] neither murmur at it nor dispute upon it, nor never did nor will. ...I faithfully pray to God for his Grace and hers both long to live and well, and their noble issue too...}}</ref> Despite this, his refusal to attend was widely interpreted as a snub against Anne, and Henry took action against him. Shortly thereafter, More was charged with accepting bribes, but the charges had to be dismissed for lack of any evidence.

In early 1534, More was accused by [[Thomas Cromwell]] of having given advice and counsel to the "Holy Maid of Kent," [[Elizabeth Barton]], a nun who had prophesied that the king had ruined his soul and would come to a quick end for having divorced Queen Catherine. This was a month after Barton had confessed, which was possibly done under royal pressure,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Religious Orders in England |volume=3 |author=David Knowles |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1979 |isbn=0-521-29568-8 |pages=188–189|author-link=David Knowles (scholar) }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Women and Religion in England: 1500–1720 |author=Patricia Crawford |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-136-09756-0 |page=29}}</ref> and was said to be concealment of treason.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8J9uNOydymUC&q=thomas+more+elizabeth+Barton&pg=PT594 |title=The Life of Thomas More |author=Peter Ackroyd |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-307-82301-4 |page=342}}</ref> Though it was dangerous for anyone to have anything to do with Barton, More had indeed met her and was impressed by her fervour. But More was prudent and told her not to interfere with state matters. More was called before a committee of the Privy Council to answer these charges of treason and, after his respectful answers the matter seemed to have been dropped.<ref name="Lee1904">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Sidney|title=Great Englishmen of the Sixteenth Century|url=https://archive.org/details/greatenglishmen00leegoog|year=1904|publisher=Archibald Constable, Limited|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/greatenglishmen00leegoog/page/n84 48]}}</ref>

On 13 April 1534, More was asked to appear before a commission and swear his allegiance to the parliamentary [[First Succession Act|Act of Succession]].<ref group=note>In March 1534, the [[First Succession Act]] passed parliament, "investing Henry VIII with the power to "visit, redress, reform, correct or amend all errors, heresies and enormities;" to define faith; and to appoint bishops.  This law also directed the monies which had previously been paid to Rome to the king's coffers.  The [[Treason Act 1534]] ([[26 Hen. 8]]. c. 13) passed in the same month among other things made it treasonable to deny the king's role as Supreme Head of the Church.' {{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia= Catholic Encyclopaedia |title= St. Thomas More| url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14689c.htm}}</ref> More accepted Parliament's right to declare [[Anne Boleyn]] the legitimate Queen of England, though he refused "the spiritual validity of the king's second marriage"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5rDAyEoHyAC&pg=PA116 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Thomas More |editor=George M.

More also publicly refused to uphold Henry's annulment from Catherine. [[John Fisher]], Bishop of Rochester, refused the oath along with More. The oath reads in part:<ref>{{cite book|last=Elton|first= Geoffrey Rudolph |title=The Tudor constitution: documents and commentary|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1982|isbn=0-521-24506-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJZZzoBJOfwC&pg=PA7 | access-date =24 July 2009|location=Cambridge, Cambridgeshire|oclc=7876927|page=7|edition= 2nd | chapter =The Crown| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CJZZzoBJOfwC&pg=PA1}}</ref>

In addition to refusing to support the King's annulment or supremacy, More refused to sign the 1534 [[Oath of Succession]] confirming Anne's role as queen and the rights of their children to succession.

===Indictment===
His enemies had enough evidence to have the King arrest him on treason. Four days later, Henry had More imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. There More prepared a devotional ''[[Dialogue of Comfort against Tribulation]]''. While More was imprisoned in the Tower, Thomas Cromwell made several visits, urging More to take the oath, which he continued to refuse.

In his unfinished ''History of the Passion'', written in the Tower to his daughter Meg, he wrote of feeling favoured by God: "For methinketh God maketh me a wanton, and setteth me on his lap and dandleth me."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Review of Book: St Thomas More's History of the Passion |journal=The Downside Review |date=April 1942 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=230–232 |doi=10.1177/001258064206000211|s2cid=220418917 }}</ref>

The charges of [[high treason]] related to More's violating the statutes as to the King's supremacy (malicious silence) and conspiring with Bishop [[John Fisher]] in this respect (malicious conspiracy) and, according to some sources, included asserting that Parliament did not have the right to proclaim the King's Supremacy over the English Church. One group of scholars believes that the judges dismissed the first two charges (malicious acts) and tried More only on the final one, but others strongly disagree.<ref name="Kelly_xiv">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oj67cj8f-rIC&q=thomas+more+refused+to+support+annulment&pg=PR14 |title=Thomas More's Trial by Jury: A Procedural and Legal Review with a Collection of Documents |editor1=Henry Ansgar Kelly |editor2=Louis W.

Regardless of the specific charges, the indictment related to violation of the [[Treasons Act 1534]] which declared it treason to speak against the King's Supremacy:<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXkkCAAAQBAJ&q=thomas+more++executed+++Lieutenant+see+me+safe+william+roper&pg=PA170 |title=Voices of the Reformation: Contemporary Accounts of Daily Life |author=John A.

===Trial===
The trial was held on 1 July 1535, before a panel of judges that included the new Lord Chancellor [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Sir Thomas Audley]], as well as Anne Boleyn's uncle [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]], her father [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]], and her brother [[George Boleyn]]. Norfolk offered More the chance of the king's "gracious pardon" should he "reform his [...] obstinate opinion". More responded that, although he had not taken the oath, he had never spoken out against it either and that his silence could be accepted as his "ratification and confirmation" of the new statutes.<ref>Ackroyd (1998) p383</ref>

Thus More was relying upon legal precedent and the maxim "''[[qui tacet consentire videtur]]''" ("one who keeps silent seems to consent"<ref>{{cite book |title=Thomas More's Trial by Jury: A Procedural and Legal Review with a Collection of Documents |editor1=Henry Ansgar Kelly |editor2=Louis W.

Thomas Cromwell, at the time the most powerful of the King's advisors, brought forth Solicitor General [[Richard Rich]] to testify that More had, in his presence, denied that the King was the legitimate head of the Church. This testimony was characterised by More as being extremely dubious. Witnesses [[Richard Southwell (courtier)|Richard Southwell]] and Mr. Palmer (a servant to Southwell) were also present and both denied having heard the details of the reported conversation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hadfield |first1=Andrew |title=Lying in early modern English culture : from the Oath of supremacy to the Oath of allegiance |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780192844804 |pages=36–38 |edition=}}</ref> As More himself pointed out:

The jury took only fifteen minutes to find More guilty.

After the jury's verdict was delivered and before his sentencing, More spoke freely of his belief that "no temporal man may be the head of the spirituality" (take over the role of the Pope). According to [[William Roper]]'s account, More was pleading that the Statute of Supremacy was contrary to [[Magna Carta]], to Church laws and to the laws of England, attempting to void the entire indictment against him.<ref name="Kelly_xiv"/>
He was sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn, and quartered]] (the usual punishment for traitors who were not the nobility), but the King commuted this to execution by decapitation.<ref group=note>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/householdsirtho00manngoog |quote=thomas more sentenced hanged, drawn and quartered. |title=The Household of Sir Thomas More |author1=Anne Manning |author2=Edmund Lodge |publisher=C.

=== Epitaph ===
In 1533, More wrote to Erasmus and included what he intended should be the epitaph on his family tomb:

<poem>
 Within this tomb Jane, wife of More, reclines;
 This More for Alice and himself designs.
 The first, dear object of my youthful vow,
 Gave me three daughters and a son to know;

 The next—ah! virtue in a stepdame rare!—
 Nursed my sweet infants with a mother's care.
 With both my years so happily have past,
 Which most my love, I know not—first or last.

=== ''History of King Richard III'' ===
Between 1512 and 1519 More worked on a ''History of [[King Richard III]]'', which he never finished but which was published after his death. The ''History'' is a Renaissance biography, remarkable more for its literary skill and adherence to classical precepts than for its historical accuracy.{{sfn|Wegemer|1996|p=218}} Some consider it an attack on royal tyranny, rather than on Richard III himself or the [[House of York]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Meyer | first = Jürgen | author-link =  | title = An Unthinkable ''History of King Richard the Third'': Thomas More's Fragment and his Answer to Lucian's ''Tyrannicide''| journal = [[Modern Language Review]] | series =  | date = 2014 | volume = 109 | issue = 3 | pages = 629–639 | doi = 10.5699/modelangrevi.109.3.0629}}</ref> More uses a more dramatic writing style than had been typical in medieval chronicles; Richard III is limned as an outstanding, archetypal tyrant—however, More was only seven years old when Richard III was killed at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] in 1485, so he had no first-hand, in-depth knowledge of him.

The ''History of King Richard III'' was written and published in both English and Latin, each written separately, and with information deleted from the Latin edition to suit a European readership.<ref name = Logan168>Logan (2011) p168</ref> It greatly influenced [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.

=== ''Utopia'' ===
{{Main|Utopia (book)}}
[[File:Insel Utopia.png|thumb|A 1516 illustration of Utopia]]
More's best known and most controversial work, ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', is a [[frame narrative]] written in Latin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=More |first1=Thomas |editor1-last=Lumby |editor1-first=J Rawson |title=More's Utopia |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=vii |edition=1952 |chapter=Introduction|date=31 October 2013 |translator-last1=Robynson|translator-first1=Raphe|translator-link1=Ralph Robinson (humanist)|isbn=978-1-107-64515-8}}</ref> More completed the book, and theologian [[Erasmus]] published it in [[Leuven]] in 1516. It was only translated into English and published in his native land in 1551 (16 years after his execution), and the 1684 translation became the most commonly cited. More (who is also a character in the book) and the narrator/traveller, Raphael Hythlodaeus (whose name alludes both to the healer archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], and 'speaker of nonsense', the surname's Greek meaning), discuss modern ills in [[Antwerp]], as well as describe the political arrangements of the imaginary island country of Utopia (a Greek pun on 'ou-topos' [no place] and 'eu-topos' [good place]) among themselves as well as to [[Pieter Gillis]] and [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]].<ref>Logan (2011) pp 39, 142, 144</ref> Utopia's original edition included a symmetrical "[[Utopian language#Writing system|Utopian alphabet]]" omitted by later editions, but which may have been an early attempt or precursor of [[shorthand]].

''Utopia'' is structured into two parts, both with much [[irony]]: Book I has conversations between friends on various European political issues: the treatment of criminals, the [[enclosure movement]], etc.; Book II is a remembered discourse by Raphael Hythlodaeus on his supposed travels, in which the earlier issues are revisited in fantastical but concrete forms that has been called ''mythical  idealism''. For example, the proposition in the Book I "no republic can be prosperous or justly governed where there is private property and money is the measure of everything."<ref name=nyers>{{cite journal |last1=Nyers |first1=Peter |title=The Politics of Enclosure in Thomas More's Utopia |journal=Problematique |date=2000 |volume=6 |url=http://www.yorku.ca/problema/issue06.html}}</ref>

''Utopia'' contrasts the contentious social life of European states with the perfectly orderly, reasonable social arrangements of Utopia and its environs (Tallstoria, Nolandia, and Aircastle). In Utopia, there are no lawyers because of the laws' simplicity and because social gatherings are in public view (encouraging participants to behave well), communal ownership supplants private property, men and women are educated alike, and there is almost complete religious toleration (except for atheists, who are allowed but despised).

More may have used [[Monasticism|monastic communalism]] as his model, although other concepts he presents such as legalising [[euthanasia]] remain far outside Church doctrine. Hythlodaeus asserts that a man who refuses to believe in a god or an afterlife could never be trusted, because he would not acknowledge any authority or principle outside himself. A scholar has suggested that More is most interested in the type of citizen Utopia produces.<ref name=nyers/>

Some take the novel's principal message to be the social need for order and discipline rather than liberty. Ironically, Hythlodaeus, who believes philosophers should not get involved in politics, addresses More's ultimate conflict between his humanistic beliefs and courtly duties as the King's servant, pointing out that one day those morals will come into conflict with the political reality.

''Utopia'' gave rise to a literary genre, [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]], which features ideal societies or perfect cities, or their opposite. Works influenced by ''Utopia'' included ''[[New Atlantis]]'' by [[Francis Bacon]], ''[[Erewhon]]'' by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], and ''[[Candide]]'' by [[Voltaire]]. Although [[Utopianism]] combined classical concepts of perfect societies ([[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) with Roman rhetorical finesse (cf. [[Cicero]], [[Quintilian]], [[epideictic]] oratory), the Renaissance genre continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and survives in modern science fiction.

=== Religious polemics ===
In 1520 the reformer [[Martin Luther]] published three works in quick succession: ''An Appeal to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation'' (Aug.), ''Concerning the Babylonish Captivity of the Church'' (Oct.), and ''On the Liberty of a Christian Man'' (Nov.).<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|225}} In these books, Luther set out his doctrine of salvation through faith alone, rejected certain Catholic practices, and attacked abuses and excesses within the Catholic Church.<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|225–6}} In 1521, Henry VIII formally responded to Luther's criticisms with the ''Assertio'', written with More's assistance.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDq-DwAAQBAJ |title = The Defence of the Seven Sacraments|isbn = 978-1-5380-9202-6|last1 = O'Donovan|first1 = Louis|date = 5 November 2019| publisher=Dalcassian Publishing Company }}</ref> [[Pope Leo X]] rewarded the English king with the title "''Fidei defensor"'' ("Defender of the Faith") for his work combating Luther's heresies.<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|226–7}}

Martin Luther then attacked Henry VIII in print, calling him a "pig, dolt, and liar".<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|227}} At the king's request, More composed a rebuttal: the ''[[Responsio ad Lutherum]]'' was published at the end of 1523. In the ''Responsio'', More defended papal supremacy, the sacraments, and other Church traditions. More, though considered "a much steadier personality",<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zENJHwQqSy0C |title=The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History |author=John Vidmar |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-8091-4234-1 |page=184|author-link=John Vidmar }}</ref> described Luther as an "ape", a "drunkard", and a "lousy little friar" amongst other epithets.<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|230}} Writing under the pseudonym of Gulielmus Rosseus,<ref name=rebhorn /> More tells Luther that:

:for as long as your reverend paternity will be determined to tell these shameless lies, others will be permitted, on behalf of his English majesty, to throw back into your paternity's shitty mouth, truly the shit-pool of all shit, all the muck and shit which your damnable rottenness has vomited up, and to empty out all the sewers and privies onto your crown divested of the dignity of the priestly crown, against which no less than the kingly crown you have determined to play the buffoon.<ref name=rex102>Rex (2011) p.102</ref>

His saying is followed with a kind of apology to his readers, while Luther possibly never apologized for his sayings.<ref name=rex102/> [[Stephen Greenblatt]] argues, "More speaks for his ruler and in his opponent's idiom; Luther speaks for himself, and his scatological imagery far exceeds in quantity, intensity, and inventiveness anything that More could muster. If for More scatology normally expresses a communal disapproval, for Luther, it expresses a deep personal rage."<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=11msvVh_3nMC |title=Learning to Curse: Essays in Early Modern Culture |author=Stephen Greenblatt |publisher=Routledge |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-136-77420-1 |page=95|author-link=Stephen Greenblatt }}</ref>

Confronting Luther confirmed More's theological conservatism. He thereafter avoided any hint of criticism of Church authority.<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|230}} In 1528, More published another religious polemic, ''A Dialogue Concerning Heresies'', that asserted the Catholic Church was the one true church, established by Christ and the Apostles, and affirmed the validity of its authority, traditions and practices.<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|279–81}} In 1529, the circulation of [[Simon Fish]]'s ''Supplication for the Beggars'' prompted More to respond with the ''Supplycatyon of Soulys''.

In 1531, a year after More's father died, [[William Tyndale]] published ''An Answer unto Sir Thomas More's Dialogue'' in response to More's ''Dialogue Concerning Heresies.'' More responded with a half million words: the ''Confutation of Tyndale's Answer''. The ''Confutation'' is an imaginary dialogue between More and Tyndale, with More addressing each of Tyndale's criticisms of Catholic rites and doctrines.<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|307–9}} More, who valued structure, tradition and order in society as safeguards against tyranny and error, vehemently believed that Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation in general were dangerous, not only to the Catholic faith but to the stability of society as a whole.<ref name="Ackroyd" />{{rp|307–9}}

=== Correspondence ===
Most major humanists were prolific letter writers, and Thomas More was no exception. As in the case of his friend Erasmus of Rotterdam, however, only a small portion of his correspondence (about 280 letters) survived. These include everything from personal letters to official government correspondence (mostly in English), letters to fellow humanist scholars (in Latin), several epistolary tracts, verse epistles, prefatory letters (some fictional) to several of More's own works, letters to More's children and their tutors (in Latin), and the so-called "prison-letters" (in English) which he exchanged with his oldest daughter Margaret while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting execution.<ref name="Gerard" /> More also engaged in controversies, most notably with the French poet [[Germain de Brie]], which culminated in the publication of de Brie's ''Antimorus'' (1519). Erasmus intervened, however, and ended the dispute.{{sfn|Moynahan|2014|p=}}

More also wrote about more spiritual matters. They include: ''A Treatise on the Passion'' (a.k.a. Treatise on the Passion of Christ), ''A Treatise to Receive the Blessed Body'' (a.k.a. Holy Body Treaty), and ''De Tristitia Christi'' (a.k.a. The Agony of Christ). More handwrote the last in the Tower of London while awaiting his execution. This last manuscript, saved from the confiscation decreed by Henry VIII, passed by the will of his daughter Margaret to Spanish hands through Fray Pedro de Soto, confessor of Emperor Charles V. More's friend [[Luis Vives]] received it in Valencia, where it remains in the collection of [[Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi]] museum.

In 1980, despite their staunch opposition to the [[English Reformation]], More and Fisher were added as martyrs of the reformation to the [[Church of England]]'s [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar]] of "Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church", to be [[Commemoration (Anglicanism)|commemorated]] every 6 July (the date of More's execution) as "Thomas More, scholar, and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, Reformation Martyrs, 1535".<ref name=CofEholyDays /><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Calendar|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/calendar|access-date=2021-03-27|website=The Church of England|language=en}}</ref> The annual remembrance of 6 July, is recognized by all Anglican Churches in communion with Canterbury, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, and South Africa.<ref name=RefRep>{{cite book|title=Reformation Reputations: The Power of the Individual in English Reformation History|year=2020|publisher=Springer International Publishing|editor=David J. Crankshaw, George W. C. Gross}}</ref>

In an essay examining the events around the addition to the Anglican calendar, Scholar William Sheils links the reasoning for More's recognition to a "long-standing tradition hinted at in Rose Macaulay's ironic debating point of 1935 about More's status as an 'unschismed Anglican', a tradition also recalled in the annual memorial lecture held at St. Dunstan's Church in Canterbury, where More's head is said to be buried."<ref name=RefRep/> Sheils also noted the influence of the 1960s play and film ''[[A Man for All Seasons (play)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' which gave More a "reputation as a defender of the right of conscience".<ref name=RefRep/> Thanks to the play's depiction,  this "brought his life to a broader and more popular audience" with the film "extending its impact worldwide following the Oscar triumphs".<ref name=RefRep/> Around this time the atheist Oxford historian and public intellectual, Hugh Trevor-Roper held More up as "the first great Englishman whom we feel that we know, the most saintly of Humanists...the universal man of our cool northern Renaissance."<ref name=RefRep/> By 1978, the quincentenary of More's birth Trevor-Roper wrote an essay putting More in the Renaissance Platonist tradition, and claim his reputation was "quite independent of his Catholicism."<ref name=RefRep/> (Only, later on, did a more critical view arise in academia, led by Professor Sir Geoffrey Elton, which "challenged More's reputation for saintliness by focusing on his dealings with heretics, the ferocity of which, in fairness to him, More did not deny. In this research, More's role as a prosecutor, or persecutor, of dissidents has been at the center of the debate.")<ref name=RefRep/>

== Legacy ==
The steadfastness and courage with which More maintained his religious convictions, and his dignity during his imprisonment, trial, and execution, contributed much to More's posthumous reputation, particularly among Roman Catholics. His friend [[Erasmus]] defended More's character as "more pure than any snow" and described his genius as "such as England never had and never again will have."<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel J.

The virtues were More's views on the primacy of conscience and his role in the practical establishment of the principle of [[Equity (law)|equity]] in English secular law through the [[Court of Chancery]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Herian |first1=Robert |title=The Conscience of Thomas More: An Introduction to Equity in Modernity |journal=The Heythrop Journal |date=January 2022 |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=64–75 |doi=10.1111/heyj.13507|s2cid=214203101 |url=https://oro.open.ac.uk/69459/9/69459.pdf }}</ref>

=== In literature and popular culture ===
[[William Roper]]'s biography of More (his father-in-law) was one of the first biographies in Modern English.

''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]'' is a play written circa 1592 in collaboration between [[Henry Chettle]], [[Anthony Munday]], [[William Shakespeare]], and others. In it More is portrayed as a wise and honest statesman. The original manuscript has survived as a handwritten text that shows many revisions by its several authors, as well as the censorious influence of [[Edmund Tylney]], [[Master of the Revels]] in the government of [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. The script has since been published and has had several productions.<ref name="Long, William B. 1989 pages 49">Long, William B. ''The Occasion of the Book of Sir Thomas More''.

In Europe in the two centuries after his death, there were at least 50 Neo-Latin school plays written about More, performed at Jesuit schools.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sutter |first1=Nicholas De |title=Sanctus martyr Thomas Morus : an unknown Neo-Latin More play from the College of Marchiennes |journal=Moreana |date=June 2022 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=1–65 |doi=10.3366/more.2022.0115}}</ref>

In 1941, the 20th-century British author [[Elizabeth Goudge]] (1900–1984) wrote a short story, "The King's Servant", based on the last few years of Thomas More's life, seen through his family, and especially his adopted daughter, Anne Cresacre More.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rawlins |first1=Christine |title=Beyond the snow : the life and faith of Elizabeth Goudge |date=2015 |publisher=Westbow |location=Bloomington, IN |isbn=978-1-4908-8619-0}}</ref>

The 20th-century agnostic playwright [[Robert Bolt]] portrayed Thomas More as the [[tragic hero]] of his 1960 play ''[[A Man for All Seasons (play)|A Man for All Seasons]]''. The title is drawn from what [[Robert Whittington]] in 1520 wrote of More:

<blockquote>More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons.<ref name="oconnell" /></blockquote>

In 1966, the play ''[[A Man for All Seasons (play)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' was adapted into a [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|film]] with the same title. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]] and adapted for the screen by the playwright. It stars [[Paul Scofield]], a noted British actor, who said that the part of Sir Thomas More was "the most difficult part I played."<ref>Gary O'Connor (2002), ''Paul Scofield: An Actor for All Seasons'', Applause Books. Page 150.</ref> The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and Scofield won the [[Best Actor Oscar]]. In 1988 [[Charlton Heston]] starred in and directed a made-for-television film that restored the character of "the common man" that had been cut from the 1966 film.

In the 1969 film ''[[Anne of the Thousand Days]]'', More is portrayed by actor [[William Squire]].

In the 1972 BBC TV series [[Henry_VIII_and_His_Six_Wives#Main_cast|Henry VIII and his Six Wives]] More was played by [[Michael Goodliffe]].

Catholic science fiction writer [[R. A. Lafferty]] wrote his novel ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' as a modern equivalent to More's ''Utopia'', which he saw as a satire. In this novel, Thomas More travels through time to the year 2535, where he is made king of the world "Astrobe", only to be beheaded after ruling for a mere nine days. One character compares More favourably to almost every other major historical figure: "He had one completely honest moment right at the end. I cannot think of anyone else who ever had one."

[[Karl Zuchardt]]'s novel, ''[[Stirb du Narr!]]'' ("Die you fool!"), about More's struggle with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry]], portrays More as an idealist bound to fail in the power struggle with a ruthless ruler and an unjust world.

In her 2009 novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', its 2012 sequel ''[[Bring Up the Bodies]]'', and the final book of the trilogy, her 2020 ''[[The Mirror & the Light]]'', the novelist [[Hilary Mantel]] portrays More (from the perspective of a sympathetically portrayed [[Thomas Cromwell]]) as an unsympathetic persecutor of Protestants and an ally of the Habsburg empire.

Literary critic James Wood in his book ''The Broken Estate'', a collection of essays, is critical of More and refers to him as "cruel in punishment, evasive in argument, lusty for power, and repressive in politics".<ref name="Wood2010">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=James|title=The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiI8Kwd6j9AC&pg=PA15|year=2010|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-42956-0|page=15}}</ref>

[[Aaron S. Zelman]]'s non-fiction book ''The State Versus the People'' includes a comparison of ''Utopia'' with Plato's ''Republic''. Zelman is undecided as to whether More was being ironic in his book or was genuinely advocating a [[police state]]. Zelman comments, "More is the only Christian saint to be honoured with a statue at the [[Kremlin]]."{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} By this Zelman implies that ''Utopia'' influenced [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks]], despite their brutal repression of religion.

Other biographers, such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], have offered a more sympathetic picture of More as both a sophisticated philosopher and man of letters, as well as a zealous Catholic who believed in the authority of the [[Holy See]] over [[Christendom]].

The protagonist of [[Walker Percy]]'s novels, ''[[Love in the Ruins]]'' and ''[[The Thanatos Syndrome]]'', is "Dr Thomas More", a reluctant Catholic and descendant of More.

More is the focus of the [[Al Stewart]] song "A Man For All Seasons" from the 1978 album ''[[Time Passages]]'', and of the [[Far (band)|Far]] song "Sir", featured on the limited editions and 2008 re-release of their 1994 album ''[[Quick (album)|Quick]]''. In addition, the song "[[So Says I]]" by indie rock outfit [[The Shins]] alludes to the socialist interpretation of More's ''Utopia''.

[[Jeremy Northam]] depicts More in the television series ''[[The Tudors]] ''as a peaceful man, as well as a devout Roman Catholic and loving family patriarch.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Robison |first1=William B. |title=History, fiction, and the Tudors : sex, politics, power, and artistic license in the Showtime television series |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-1-137-43881-2 |page=13}}</ref>

In [[David Starkey]]'s 2009 documentary series ''[[Henry VIII: The Mind of a Tyrant]]'', More is depicted by Ryan Kiggell.

More is depicted by [[Andrew Buchan]] in the television series ''[[The Spanish Princess]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nissen |first1=Dano |title=TV News Roundup: 'The Spanish Princess' Sets New and Returning Cast |url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/tv-news-roundup-spanish-princess-casting-real-housewives-of-atlanta-season-12-1203350779/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=26 September 2019}}</ref>

{{main article|Beaufort House (Chelsea)}}
[[File:Beaufort House, Chelsea from the series Britannia Illustrata 2020.163.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Beaufort House next to the Thames, {{Circa|1707}}]]

As More's royal duties frequently required his attendance at the king's [[River Thames|Thames-side]] palaces in both [[Richmond Palace|Richmond]] and [[Palace of Placentia|Greenwich]], it was convenient to select a riverside property situated between them (the common method of transport being by boat) for his home. In about 1520 he purchased a parcel of land comprising "undisturbed wood and pasture", stretching from the Thames in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] to the present-day [[King's Road]]. There he caused to be built a dignified red-brick mansion (known simply as More's house or Chelsea House) in which he lived until his arrest in 1534.  In the bawdy poem ''The Twelve Mery Jestes of Wyddow Edyth'', written in 1525 by a member of More's household (or even by More himself) using the pseudonym of "Walter Smith", the widow arrives by boat at "Chelsay...where she had best cheare of all/in the house of Syr Thomas More."<ref>Ackroyd (1999) p. 244. Bibliographer [[William Carew Hazlitt]] in his ''Shakespeare Jest Book'' Volume III ({{OCLC| 690506548}}) assigns publication of the work to More's brother-in-law [[John Rastell]], with a date of 23 March 1525.</ref>

Upon More's arrest the estate was confiscated, coming into the possession of the [[Comptroller of the Royal Household]], [[William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester|William Paulet]].

In 1682, the property was renamed ''Beaufort House'' after [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|1st Duke of Beaufort]], a new owner.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beaver |first1=Alfred |title=Memorials of Old Chelsea |date=1892 |publisher=[[Elliot Stock]]|location=London |oclc=499072940 |pages=118–138|quote=In...1682...Chelsey...was sold to...the first Duke of Beaufort...and henceforth bore [the] name.}}</ref>

{{Main|Chelsea Old Church#16th century and Sir Thomas More}}
[[File:Chelsea Old Church 14.JPG|thumb|Statue of Thomas More outside [[Chelsea Old Church]] in west London]]
Across a small park and Old Church Street from Crosby Hall is [[Chelsea Old Church]], an Anglican church whose southern chapel More commissioned and in which he sang with the parish choir. Except for his chapel, the church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1958.<ref name =RBKC>{{cite web |title=Thomas More Comes to Chelsea |url=https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/vmhistory/general/vm_hs_p02.asp |website=www.rbkc.gov.uk |publisher=[[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]] |access-date=19 January 2021 |archive-date=21 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210621225239/https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/vmhistory/general/vm_hs_p02.asp |url-status=dead }}</ref> The capitals on the medieval arch connecting the chapel to the main sanctuary display symbols associated with More and his office. On the southern wall of the sanctuary is the tomb and epitaph he erected for himself and his wives, detailing his ancestry and accomplishments in Latin, including his role as peacemaker between the various Christian European states as well as a curiously altered portion about his curbing heresy. When More served Mass, he would leave by the door just to the left of it. He is not, however, buried here, nor is it entirely certain which of his family may be. It is open to the public at specific times. Outside the church, facing the [[River Thames]], is a statue by British Sculptor, [[Leslie Cubitt Bevis]] erected in 1969, commemorating More as "saint", "scholar", and "statesman"; the back displays his coat-of-arms. Nearby, on Upper Cheyne Row, the Roman Catholic Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer & St. Thomas More honours the martyr.

The chapel is accessible to Tower visitors.

=== St Katharine Docks ===
Thomas More is commemorated by a stone [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] near [[St Katharine Docks]], just east of the Tower where he was executed. The street in which it is situated was formerly called Nightingale Lane, a corruption of "Knighten Guild", derived from the original owners of the land. It is now renamed Thomas More Street in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringeastlondon.co.uk/eel/Stkatharines/Stkatharines.htm#More|title=St Katharine's Dock|publisher=Exploring East London|access-date=4 November 2015}}</ref>

=== St Dunstan's Church and Roper House, Canterbury ===
[[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]], an Anglican parish church in Canterbury, possesses More's head, rescued by his daughter [[Margaret Roper]], whose family lived in Canterbury down and across the street from their parish church. A stone immediately to the left of the altar marks the sealed Roper family vault beneath the Nicholas Chapel, itself to the right of the church's sanctuary or main altar. [[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]] has carefully investigated, preserved and sealed this burial vault. The last archaeological investigation revealed that the suspected head of More rests in a niche separate from the other bodies, possibly from later interference.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schulte Herbrüggen|first=Hubertus|title=Das Haupt des Thomas Morus in der St. Dunstan-Kirche zu Canterbury|series=Forschungsberichte des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen|year=1982|publisher=VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften}}</ref> Displays in the chapel record the archaeological findings in pictures and narratives. Roman Catholics donated stained glass to commemorate the events in More's life. A small plaque marks the former home of William and Margaret Roper; another house nearby and entitled Roper House is now a home for deaf people.
