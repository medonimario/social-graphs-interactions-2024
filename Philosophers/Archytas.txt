As a Pythagorean, Archytas believed that arithmetic (logistic), rather than geometry, provided the basis for satisfactory proofs,<ref>Morris Kline, Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times Oxford University Press, 1972 p. 49</ref> and developed the most famous argument for the infinity of the universe in antiquity.<ref name=":0">{{Citation |last=Huffman |first=Carl |title=Archytas |date=2020 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entries/archytas/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |access-date=2023-10-28 |edition=Winter 2020 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref>

==Life ==
Archytas was born in Tarentum, a Greek city in the [[Italian Peninsula]] that was part of [[Magna Graecia]], and was the son of Hestiaeus. He was presumably taught by [[Philolaus]], and taught mathematics to [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] and to Eudoxus' student, [[Menaechmus]].<ref name=":0" />

Politically and militarily, Archytas appears to have been the dominant figure in Tarentum in his generation, somewhat comparable to [[Pericles]] in [[Athens]] a half-century earlier.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Despotopoulos |first=Constantin |date=2004-11-01 |title=Archytas' Logismos and Logistika |url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=philinquiry&id=philinquiry_2004_0026_0003_0001_0009 |journal=Philosophical Inquiry |language=en |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.5840/philinquiry200426311}}</ref> The Tarentines elected him ''[[strategos]]'' ("general") seven years in a row, a step that required them to violate their own rule against successive appointments. Archytas was allegedly undefeated as a general in Tarentine campaigns against their southern Italian neighbors.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Johnson |first=M. R. |date=2008 |title=Sources for the Philosophy of Archytas |url=https://philarchive.org/rec/JOHSFT |access-date=2023-10-30 |website=philarchive.org |language=en}}</ref>

In his public career, Archytas had a reputation for virtue as well as efficacy. The ''[[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Seventh Letter]]'', traditionally attributed to [[Plato]], asserts that Archytas attempted to rescue Plato during his difficulties with [[Dionysius the Younger|Dionysius II]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lloyd |first=G.

R. |date=1990 |title=Plato and Archytas in the "Seventh Letter" |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4182355 |journal=Phronesis |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=159–174 |doi=10.1163/156852890X00097 |jstor=4182355 |issn=0031-8868}}</ref> Some scholars have argued that Archytas may have served as one model for Plato's [[philosopher king]], and that he influenced Plato's political philosophy as expressed in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' and other works.<ref name=":0" />

==Works==
Archytas is said to be the first ancient Greek to have spoken of the sciences of [[arithmetic]] (logistic), [[geometry]], [[astronomy]], and [[Pythagorean tuning|harmonics]] as kin, which later became the medieval [[quadrivium]].<ref>

</ref> Before this, [[Hippocrates of Chios]] had reduced this problem to the finding of two mean [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionals]], equivalent to the extraction of [[cube root]]s. Archytas' demonstration uses lines generated by moving figures to construct the two proportionals between magnitudes and was, according to [[Diogenes Laërtius]], the first in which mechanical motions entered geometry.{{efn|

: ''And therefore Plato himself dislikes Eudoxus, Archytas, and Menaechmus for endeavoring to bring down the doubling the cube to mechanical operations; for by this means all that was good in geometry would be lost and corrupted, it falling back again to sensible things, and not rising upward and considering immaterial and immortal images, in which God being versed is always God.''
}} The topic of proportions, which Archytas seems to have worked on extensively, is treated in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], where the construction for two proportional means can also be found.<ref>

{{Blockquote|text=Archytas made a wooden model of a dove with such mechanical ingenuity and art that it flew; so nicely balanced was it, you see, with weights and moved by a current of air enclosed and hidden within it. About so improbable a story I prefer to give Favorinus' own words: "Archytas the Tarentine, being in other lines also a mechanician, made a flying dove out of wood. Whenever it lit, it did not rise again."}}

Aulus Gellius views the reporting of the tradition as problematic, since it spreads implausible beliefs even if accompanied by skepticism.<ref>
