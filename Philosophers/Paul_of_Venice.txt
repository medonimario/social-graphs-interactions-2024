'''Paul of Venice''' (or '''Paulus Venetus'''; 1369–1429) was a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[philosopher]], [[theologian]], [[logician]] and [[metaphysician]] of the [[Order of Saint Augustine]].

==Life==
Paul was born, according to the chroniclers of his order, at [[Udine]], about 1369 and died at [[Venice]] on 15 June 1429,<ref name="Punta1978">{{cite book | editor = Francesco Del Punta | author1 = Paolo (Veneto) | author2 = Paulus (de Venetiis.) | date = 1978 | title = Logica Magna, Part 2; Part 6 | publisher = British Academy | pages = | isbn = 978-0-19-725962-7 | oclc = 1015392634 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Xe7WAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR7}}</ref> as '''Paolo Nicoletti'''.<ref name="KretzmannKennyPinborg1982">{{cite book | editor1 = Norman Kretzmann | editor2 = Anthony Kenny | editor3 = Jan Pinborg | editor4 = Eleonore Stump | date = 1982 | title = The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy: From the Rediscovery of Aristotle to the Disintegration of Scholasticism, 1100-1600 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | pages = 875– | isbn = 978-0-521-36933-6 | oclc = 1024723432 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l821N_9GSusC&pg=PA875}}</ref> He joined the [[Order of St Augustine|Augustinian Order]] at the age of 14, at the convent of [[Santo Stefano, Venice|Santo Stefano]] in Venice. In 1390 he is said to have been sent to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] for his studies in theology, but returned to Italy, and finished his course at the [[University of Padua]], becoming a Doctor of Arts and Theology in 1405. He lectured in the Universities of Padua, [[University of Siena|Siena]], [[University of Perugia|Perugia]], and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]] during the first quarter of the fifteenth century.<ref name=":0">{{Citation |last=Conti |first=Alessandro |title=Paul of Venice |date=2017 |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/paul-venice/ |access-date=2024-09-04 |edition=Summer 2017 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |editor2-last=Nodelman |editor2-first=Uri}}</ref> He was also a teacher to [[Paolo da Pergola]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.textmanuscripts.com/home/archives/archivesdescription.php?m%3D107 |title=Text manuscripts/New items |access-date=2007-01-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613041248/http://www.textmanuscripts.com/home/archives/archivesdescription.php?m=107 |archive-date=2006-06-13 }}</ref> 

Paul was also appointed Prior General of the Augustinian Order in 1409 by [[Pope Gregory XII]], and also served as an ambassador to the Republic of Venice. Paul was one of the theologians called to [[Rome]] in 1427 by [[Pope Martin V]] to defend the orthodoxy of [[Bernardino of Siena|St. Bernardino of Siena]], occasioned by Bernardino's use of inscriptions of the name of Jesus in worship. In 1429, Paul died in Padua, while he was completing his commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[De Anima]].''<ref name=":0" />

==Philosophical work==

Paul's philosophy has been categorised within the [[Medieval realism|realist]] tradition of medieval thought.<ref name="springer"></ref> Following on from [[John Wycliffe]] and the subsequent Oxonians who followed him, Paul further developed this new brand of realism, and further renewed [[Walter Burley]]’s opposition to [[nominalism]]. Paul's metaphysical theses are rooted fundamentally in [[Scotist]] thought. [[Duns Scotus]] maintained the  doctrine of the [[univocity of being]] and the existence of the universal forms of objects outside of the person's mind. He also maintained Scotus' notion of the real identity and the formal distinction between [[essence]] and [[Being (theology)|being]], alongside the notion of "[[thisness]]" as the principle of individuation.<ref>Conti, Alessandro, "Paul of Venice", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/paul-venice/>.</ref> Paul was also simultaneously influenced by other thinkers of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic period]], including the [[Order of preachers|Dominican]] thinkers [[Albert the Great]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], and his fellow Augustinian, [[Giles of Rome]]. Paul also critically engaged with the works and doctrines of fourteenth-century nominalists such as [[William Ockham]], [[John Buridan]], and [[Marsilius of Inghen]], and sometimes gauged these thinkers' theses against each other to undermine their positions.<ref>Conti, Alessandro, "Paul of Venice", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/paul-venice/>.</ref>
