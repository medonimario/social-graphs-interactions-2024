==Early life==
[[File:1889-VernadskyVI-Paris.jpg|thumb|left|Vladimir Vernadsky, Paris 1889]]
Vernadsky was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire]], on {{OldStyleDate|12 March|1863|28 February}} in the family of the native [[Kyiv]] residents Russian Imperial economist Ivan Vernadsky and music instructor Anna Konstantinovich, who came from an old Russia noble family.{{sfn|Гумилевский|1988|с=}}{{full citation needed|date=May 2024}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sgm.ru/ABOUT/Rodoslovnaya.php|title=Родословная В.

Vladimir's mother was a Russian noblewoman of Ukrainian Cossack descent.<ref>В.В. Томазов. Генеалогія В.І. Вернадського: походження та родинні зв'язки ''tr. V.V. Tomasov. Genealogy V.I. Vernadsky: a voyage of motherland''</ref> In 1868 his family relocated to [[Kharkiv]], and in 1873 he entered the Kharkiv provincial gymnasium.
Vernadsky graduated from [[Saint Petersburg State University]] in 1885. As the position of [[mineralogist]] in [[Saint Petersburg State University]] was vacant, and [[Vasily Dokuchaev]], a soil scientist, and [[Alexey Pavlov]], a geologist, had been teaching Mineralogy for a while, Vernadsky chose to enter Mineralogy. He wrote to his wife Nataliia on 20 June 1888 from Switzerland:
{{blockquote|To collect facts for their own sake, as many now gather facts, without a program, without a question to answer or a purpose, is not interesting. However, there is a task which someday the human mind will solve, and which is extremely interesting. Minerals are remains of those chemical reactions which took place at various times on earth; these reactions take place according to laws which are not always known to us, but which, we are allowed to think, are closely tied to general changes which the earth has undergone as a planet. The task is to connect the various phases of changes undergone by the earth with the general laws of celestial mechanics.<ref>

While trying to find a topic for his doctorate, he first went to [[Naples]] to study under [[crystallography|crystallographer]] [[Arcangelo Scacchi]], who was [[Dementia|senile]] by that time. Scacchi's condition led Vernadsky to go to Germany to study under [[Paul Heinrich von Groth|Paul Groth]], curator of minerals in the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich. Vernadsky learned to use Groth's modern equipment, which included a machine to study the [[optical]], [[Heat|thermal]], [[elastic (solid mechanics)|elastic]], [[magnetic]] and electrical properties of [[crystal]]s. He also gained access to the physics lab of [[Leonhard Sohncke]] (Direktor, {{Lang|de|Physikalisches Institut der Universität Jena|italic=no}}, 1883–1886; Professor der Physik an der Technischen Hochschule München 1886–1897), who was studying [[Crystallization|crystallisation]] during that period.

In his childhood, his father had a huge influence on his development, he very carefully and consistently engaged in the upbringing and education of his son. It was he who instilled in Volodymyr interest and love for the Ukrainian people, their history and culture. The future scientist recalled that before moving from Kharkiv to St. Petersburg, he and his father were abroad and in Milan, they read about a circular in [[Pyotr Lavrov]]'s newspaper "Forward" that forbade printing in Ukrainian in Russia. In his memoirs, he wrote:

{{Blockquote|''This made a huge impression on my father, and the conversations related to this had a strong effect on me at the time. My father told the history of Ukraine in a completely different way than it was taught in the gymnasium. He often mentioned that Petersburg was built on the bones of Ukrainians (Cossacks from Ivan Mazepa's regiments built Petersburg). After returning to St. Petersburg, I tried to familiarize myself with Ukrainian literature. In his father's library, he found scattered issues of Osnovy and other Ukrainian publications. Obtained Ukrainian books from second-hand booksellers, and received some from abroad. He asked his father in detail about Shevchenko, Kulish, Maksymovich, Kvitka-Osnovianenko, whom he knew personally, as well as about the Cyril-Methodiev brotherhood, about Kostomarov, etc.''}}<ref>{{cite web | url=https://meest-online.com/history/figure/do-150-richnoho-yuvileyu-volodymyra-vernadskoho/ | title=До 150-річного ювілею Володимира Вернадського | date=7 March 2013 }}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite web | url=https://ogo.ua/articles/view/2013-03-12/38801.html | title=На купюрі 1000 гривень - вчений, який працював у Рівному! &#124; ОГО }}</ref>

==Political activities==
Vernadsky participated in the First General Congress of the [[zemstvo]]s, held in Petersburg on the eve of the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] to discuss how best to pressure the government to the needs of the Russian society; became a member of the liberal [[Constitutional Democratic Party]] (KD); and served in parliament, resigning to protest the [[Tsar]]'s proroguing of the Duma. He served as professor and later as vice rector of [[Moscow University]], from which he also resigned in 1911 in protest over the government's reactionary policies {{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}.

Following the advent of the [[First World War]], his proposal for the establishment of the [[Commission for the Study of the Natural Productive Forces]] (KEPS) was adopted by the [[Imperial Academy of Sciences]] in February 1915. He published ''War and the Progress of Science'' where he stressed the importance of science as regards to its contribution to the war effort:<ref name="Oldfield">{{Cite web |last=Oldfield |first=jon |title=Russian geography and the Commission for the Study of the Natural Productive Forces of Russia (KEPS), 1915–1930 |url=https://www.york.ac.uk/media/history/russianenvironment/solovki/Papers%20Oldfield%20.pdf |access-date=1 August 2020 |website=www.york.ac.uk |publisher=University of York}}</ref>

:After the war of 1914–1915 we will have to make known and accountable the natural productive forces of our country, i.e. first of all to find means for broad scientific investigations of Russia’s nature and for the establishment of a network of well equipped research laboratories, museums and institutions ...

Vladimir Vernadsky had dual "Russian–Ukrainian" identity<ref name="University of Pittsburgh Press"/> and considered the Ukrainian culture as part of Russian imperial culture,<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/rizne/gyrych.htm|title=Ігор Гирич.

==Scientific activities==
Vernadsky first popularized the concept of the [[noosphere]] and deepened the idea of the [[biosphere]] to the meaning largely recognized by today's scientific community. The word 'biosphere' was invented by Austrian geologist [[Eduard Suess]], whom Vernadsky met in 1911.

In Vernadsky's theory of the Earth's development, the noosphere is the third stage in the earth's development, after the [[geosphere]] (inanimate matter) and the biosphere (biological life). Just as the [[emergence]] of life fundamentally transformed the geosphere, the emergence of human [[cognition]] will fundamentally transform the biosphere. In this theory, the principles of both life and cognition are essential features of the Earth's [[evolution]], and must have been implicit in the earth all along. This systemic and geological analysis of living systems complements [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} which looks at each individual species, rather than at its relationship to a subsuming principle.

Vernadsky's visionary pronouncements were not widely accepted in the West. However, he was one of the first scientists to recognize that the [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] in the Earth's atmosphere result from biological processes. During the 1920s he published works arguing that living organisms could reshape the planets as surely as any physical force. Vernadsky was an important pioneer of the scientific bases for the environmental sciences.<ref>Weart, S.R. (2003) ''The Discovery of Global Warming,'' Cambridge, Harvard Press</ref>

Vernadsky was a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Russian and Soviet Academies of Sciences]] since 1912 and was a founder and first president of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Kyiv]], Ukraine (1918). He was a founder of the [[Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine|National Library of Ukrainian State]] and worked closely with the [[Tavrida National V.I. Vernadsky University|Tavrida University]] in [[Crimea]]. During the [[Russian Civil War]], he hosted gatherings of the young intellectuals who later founded the émigré [[Eurasianism]] movement.<ref>See Vernadsky's diaries in the "Works" section, summarized in Sergei Glebov. "Russian and East European Books and Manuscripts in the United States" in ''Russian and East European Books and Manuscripts in the United States: Proceedings of a Conference in Honor of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Bakhmeteff Archive of Russian and East European History and Culture'' (''Slavic and East European Information Resources'', Volume 4, Number 4 2003), eds. Jared S. Ingersoll and Tanya Chebotarev, The Haworth Press, 2003,  {{ISBN|0-7890-2405-5}} p. 29</ref>

In the late 1930s and early 1940s Vernadsky played an early advisory role in the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]], as one of the most forceful voices arguing for the exploitation of [[nuclear power]], the surveying of Soviet [[uranium]] sources, and having [[nuclear fission]] research conducted at his Radium Institute. He died, however, before a full project was pursued.

On religious views, Vernadsky was an [[atheist]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Margulis |first1=Lynn |author-link=Lynn Margulis |title=What Is Life? |last2=Sagan, Dorion |author2-link=Dorion Sagan |publisher=University of California Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-520-22021-8 |page=170 |quote=Both the French paleontologist-priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and the Russian atheist Vladimir Vernadsky agreed that Earth is developing a global mind.}}</ref> He was interested in [[Hinduism]] and [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Neelakandan |first=Aravindan |date=21 February 2013 |title=Vernadsky, Noosphere and Vivekananda |url=http://centreright.in/2013/02/vernadsky-noosphere-and-vivekananda/#.VDAUHpbIbFE |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530033248/http://centreright.in/2013/02/vernadsky-noosphere-and-vivekananda/#.VDAUHpbIbFE |archive-date=30 May 2015 |access-date=17 May 2015 |publisher=Centreright.in}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Yuva Bharati February 2012 &#124; Vivekananda Kendra Prakashan |url=http://prakashan.vivekanandakendra.org/periodicals/yuvabharati/2012/february |access-date=17 May 2015 |publisher=Prakashan.vivekanandakendra.org}}</ref>

Vernadsky's son [[George Vernadsky]] (1887–1973) emigrated to the United States where he published numerous books on medieval and modern Russian history.

The [[Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine|National Library of Ukraine]], the [[Tavrida National University]] in [[Crimea]] and many streets and avenues in Ukraine and Russia are named in honor of Vladimir Vernadsky.

[[UNESCO]] sponsored an international scientific conference, "Globalistics-2013", at Moscow State University on 23–25 October 2013, in honor of Vernadsky's 150th birthday.
