'''Urbanus Henricus Rhegius''' or '''Urban Rieger''' (May 1489, in [[Langenargen]] &ndash; 23 May 1541, in [[Celle]]) was a [[Protestant Reformer]] who was active both in Northern and Southern [[Germany]] in order to promote ''[[Lutheran]] unity'' in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He was also a popular poet. [[Martin Luther]] referred to him as the "Bishop of Lower Saxony".

== Life ==

He was born '''Urban Rieger''', the son of Konrad Rieger, a Catholic priest, and his mistress (priests not being allowed to marry) at Langenargen on [[Lake Constance]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://reformation500.csl.edu/bio/urbanus-rhegius/|title = Urbanus Rhegius|date = 24 September 2014}}</ref>

He was educated at the Latin school in [[Lindau (Bodensee)|Lindau]] and then studied arts at [[Freiburg University]]. He befriended [[Wolfgang Capito]] at the university. After graduating in 1510 he undertook further studies at [[Ingolstadt University]] specifically to come under the tutelage of [[John Eck]], graduating MA in 1516. During this period he was created [[poet laureate]] by Emperor Maximilian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reformation500.csl.edu/bio/urbanus-rhegius/|title=Urbanus Rhegius|date=24 September 2014}}</ref>

In 1519 he went to [[Konstanz]] where he befriended [[Johann Faber|Johann Fabri]], who encouraged him to train as a preacher, and after brief studies at [[Tübingen]], in 1520 he became a Catholic priest in [[Augsburg]], replacing [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] who had left to join the Reform Movement. A condition of this appointment was to gain a doctorate which he did at the [[University of Basel]] later that year. From 1521 he began to support the Reform Movement and was a clear admirer of [[Martin Luther]]. This forced him to leave his post, and he returned to Langenargen, before going to Hall in the [[Tyrol]] where he preached until 1523. Augsburg then invited him to return as preacher for the [[Carmelite]] Church of St Anne. Here he began to spread his own ideas in line with the Reform Movement. He initially avoided putting these views in print.<ref>The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation</ref>

In 1525 he Latinised his name to Urbanus Rhegius. It was under this name that he began publishing Protestant views. He married in this year, usually a forbidden practice as a priest, but accepted in the Protestant views.

From 1527 he began publishing pamphlets against the [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] Movement, which had begun as a rival movement to both Catholicism and Protestantism in that year. In these early years of Protestantism he proved an arbiter of the different views, particularly the different views on the [[Eucharist]], expressed by [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[Zwingli]], and these views won the admiration of [[Philip of Hesse]]. In this capacity, in 1530 he was one of the collaborators (along with Luther and others) who created the [[Augsburg Confession]].

He stayed at Augsburg until 1530 then his final role was as superintendent of the [[Principality of Lüneburg|Duchy of Lüneberg]] (under Ernst of Lüneberg), living thereafter at [[Celle]]. From 1535 he was a strong advocate of tolerating the Jews within Germany (an uncommon view at that time).<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/arg.1990.81.issue-jg/arg-1990-jg10/arg-1990-jg10.xml|doi = 10.14315/arg-1990-jg10|title = Toleration of the Jews in the German Reformation: Urbanus Rhegius and Braunschweig (1535–1540)|year = 1990|last1 = Hendrix|first1 = Scott H.|journal = Archiv für Reformationsgeschichte - Archive for Reformation History|volume = 81|pages = 189–215|s2cid = 163391408}}</ref>
