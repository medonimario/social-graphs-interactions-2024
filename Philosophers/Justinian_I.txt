His reign was marked by the ambitious but only partly realized ''[[renovatio imperii]]'', or "restoration of the Empire".<ref>J. F. Haldon, ''Byzantium in the seventh century'' (Cambridge, 2003), 17–19.</ref> This ambition was expressed by the partial recovery of the territories of the defunct [[Western Roman Empire]].<ref>On the western Roman Empire, see now H. Börm, ''Westrom'' (Stuttgart 2013).</ref> His general, [[Belisarius]], swiftly conquered the [[Vandal Kingdom]] in North Africa. Subsequently, Belisarius, [[Narses]], and other generals conquered the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]], restoring [[Dalmatia]], [[Sicily]], [[Italian peninsula|Italy]], and [[Rome]] to the empire after more than half a century of rule by the [[Ostrogoths]]. The [[Liberius (praetorian prefect)|praetorian prefect Liberius]] reclaimed the south of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], establishing the province of [[Spania]]. These campaigns re-established Roman control over the western Mediterranean, increasing the Empire's annual revenue by over a million ''[[solidi]]''.<ref name="tulane.edu" /> During his reign, Justinian also subdued the ''[[Zan people|Tzani]]'', a people on the east coast of the [[Black Sea]] that had never been under Roman rule before.<ref>Evans, J. A. S., ''The Age of Justinian: the circumstances of imperial power''. pp. 93–94</ref> He engaged the [[Sasanian Empire]] in the east during [[Kavad I]]'s reign, and later again during [[Khosrow I]]'s reign; this second conflict was partially initiated due to his ambitions in the west.

Justinian is regarded as one of the most prominent and influential Roman emperors, and historians have often characterized him as a workaholic who worked tirelessly to expand the Byzantine empire.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Woudhuysen |first=George |date=2023-12-24 |title=Restless zeal of the insomniac emperor |url=https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/december-january-2024/restless-zeal-of-the-insomniac-emperor/ |access-date=2024-09-04 |website=The Critic Magazine |language=en-GB}}</ref> One of the most enduring aspects of his legacy was the uniform rewriting of Roman law, the {{Lang|la|[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]}}, which was first applied throughout Continental Europe and is still the basis of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in many modern states.<ref>John Henry Merryman and Rogelio Pérez-Perdomo, ''The Civil Law Tradition: An Introduction to the Legal Systems of Europe and Latin America'', 3rd ed.

Justinian achieved lasting fame through his judicial reforms, particularly through the complete revision of all [[Roman law]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Department |first=Reference |title=GW Law Library: Library Guides: Roman Law Research: Corpus Juris Civilis |url=https://law.gwu.libguides.com/romanlaw/corpusjuriscivilis |access-date=2024-10-20 |website=law.gwu.libguides.com |language=en}}</ref> something that had not previously been attempted. The total of Justinian's legislation is known today as the {{Lang|la|[[Corpus juris civilis]]}}. It consists of the ''[[Codex Justinianeus]],'' the ''Digesta'' or ''[[Pandectae]]'', the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'', and the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Novellae]]''.

Early in his reign, Justinian had appointed the ''[[quaestor sacri palatii|quaestor]]'' [[Tribonian]] to oversee this task. The first draft of the ''[[Codex Justinianeus]]'', a codification of imperial constitutions from the 2nd century onward, was issued on 7 April 529. (The final version appeared in 534.) It was followed by the ''Digesta'' (or ''[[Pandectae]]''), a compilation of older legal texts, in 533, and by the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'', a textbook explaining the principles of law. The ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Novellae]]'', a collection of new laws issued during Justinian's reign, supplements the ''Corpus''. As opposed to the rest of the corpus, the ''Novellae'' appeared in [[Greek language|Greek]], the common language of the Eastern Empire.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Johnston |first=David |title=Roman Law in Context |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |isbn=0521639611 |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |pages=24}}</ref>

The ''Corpus'' forms the basis of Latin jurisprudence (including ecclesiastical [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]]) and, for historians, provides a valuable insight into the concerns and activities of the later Roman Empire. As a collection it gathers together the many sources in which the ''leges'' (laws) and the other rules were expressed or published: proper laws, [[Byzantine Senate|senatorial]] consults (''senatusconsulta''), imperial decrees, [[case law]], and jurists' opinions and interpretations (''responsa prudentium'').
Tribonian's code ensured the survival of Roman law. It formed the basis of later Byzantine law, as expressed in the ''[[Basilika]]'' of [[Basil I]] and [[Leo VI the Wise]]. The only western province where the Justinianic code was introduced was Italy (after the conquest by the so-called [[Pragmatic Sanction of Justinian I|Pragmatic Sanction of 554]]),<ref>Kunkel, W. (translated by J. M. Kelly) ''An introduction to Roman legal and constitutional history''. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1966; 168</ref> from where it was to pass to [[Western Europe]] in the 12th century and become the basis of much Continental European law code, which was eventually spread by European empires to the [[Americas]] and beyond in the [[Age of Discovery]]. It eventually passed to [[Eastern Europe]] where it appeared in Slavic editions, and it also passed on to [[Russia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=3001333 |title=Russia and the Roman Law |journal=American Slavic and East European Review |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |author=Darrell P.

He passed laws to protect prostitutes from exploitation and women from being [[forced prostitution|forced into prostitution]]. Rapists were treated severely. Further, by his policies: women charged with major crimes should be guarded by other women to prevent sexual abuse; if a woman was widowed, her dowry should be returned; and a husband could not take on a major debt without his wife giving her consent twice.<ref>Garland (1999), pp.&nbsp;16–17</ref>

Family legislation also revealed a greater concern for the interests of children. This was particularly so with respect to children born out of wedlock. The law under Justinian also reveals a striking interest in child neglect issues. Justinian protected the rights of children whose parents remarried and produced more offspring, or who simply separated and abandoned their offspring, forcing them to beg.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sarris |first=Peter |title=Christianity and Family Law |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-23325-5 |editor-last=Witte |editor-first=J. |chapter=Emperor Justinian |doi=10.1017/9781108233255.008 |editor-last2=Hauk |editor-first2=G.}}</ref>

Justinian discontinued the regular appointment of [[Roman consul|Consuls]] in 541.<ref>Vasiliev (1952), p. I 192.</ref>

In Constantinople, under Justinian, hospitals were built and free medical care provided to the many poor residents of the city. In addition, public baths were free for all residents and 20 state bakeries provided free bread to those who needed it. According to one study, “The empire’s social welfare programs ensured that no one went hungry.”<ref>Daily Life in Ancient and Modern Istanbul By Robert Bator, 2000, P.15</ref>

===Nika riots===
{{Main|Nika riots}}
[[File:Diptych Barberini Louvre OA9063 whole.jpg|thumb|The [[Barberini Ivory]], thought to portray either Justinian or [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius&nbsp;I]]]]

Justinian's habit of choosing efficient but unpopular advisers nearly cost him his throne early in his reign. In January 532, partisans of the [[chariot racing]] factions in Constantinople, normally rivals, united against Justinian in a revolt that has become known as the [[Nika riots]]. They forced him to dismiss [[Tribonian]] and two of his other ministers, and then attempted to overthrow Justinian himself and replace him with the senator [[Hypatius (consul 500)|Hypatius]], who was a nephew of the late emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]]. While the crowd was rioting in the streets, Justinian considered fleeing the capital by sea, but eventually decided to stay, apparently on the prompting of his wife Theodora, who refused to leave. In the next two days, he ordered the brutal suppression of the riots by his generals Belisarius and [[Mundus (general)|Mundus]]. Procopius relates that 30,000<ref name="riot">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 200</ref> unarmed civilians were killed in the Hippodrome. On Theodora's insistence, and apparently against his own judgment,<ref>Diehl, Charles.

Rosenbaum from the original French ''Theodora, Imperatice de Byzance''), 89.</ref> Justinian had Anastasius' nephews executed.<ref>Vasiliev (1958), p. 157.</ref>

The destruction that took place during the revolt provided Justinian with an opportunity to tie his name to a series of splendid new buildings, most notably the architectural innovation of the domed [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=116}}

===Military activities===

One of the most spectacular features of Justinian's reign was the recovery of large stretches of land around the Western Mediterranean basin that had slipped out of Imperial control in the 5th century.<ref>For an account of Justinian's wars, see Moorhead (1994), pp. 22–24, 63–98, and 101–109.</ref> As a Christian Roman emperor, Justinian considered it his divine duty to restore the [[Roman Empire]] to its ancient boundaries.

====Conquest of North Africa, 533–534====
{{Main|Vandalic War}}

The first of the western kingdoms Justinian attacked was that of the [[Vandals]] in [[North Africa]]. King [[Hilderic]], who had maintained good relations with Justinian and the North African [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] clergy, had been overthrown by his cousin [[Gelimer]] in 530 AD. Imprisoned, the deposed king appealed to Justinian. Justinian protested Gelimer's actions, demanding that Gelimer return the kingdom to Hilderic. Gelimer replied, in effect, that Justinian had no authority to make these demands. Angered at this response, Justinian quickly concluded [[Iberian War|his ongoing war]] with the [[Sassanian Empire]] and prepared an expedition against the Vandals in 533.<ref name="Procopius-Dewing" />

In 533, Belisarius sailed to Africa with a fleet of 92 [[dromon]]s, escorting 500 transports carrying an army of about 15,000 men, as well as a number of barbarian troops. They landed at [[Caput Vada|Caput Vada (modern Ras Kaboudia)]] in modern [[Tunisia]]. They defeated the Vandals, who were caught completely off guard, at [[Ad Decimum]] on 14 September 533 and [[Battle of Tricamarum|Tricamarum]] in December; Belisarius took [[Carthage]]. King [[Gelimer]] fled to Mount Pappua in [[Numidia]], but surrendered the next spring. He was taken to Constantinople, where he was paraded in a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]], the [[Balearic Islands]], and the stronghold [[Ceuta|Septem Fratres]] near [[Mons Calpe]] (later named [[Gibraltar]]) were recovered in the same campaign.<ref>Moorhead (1994), p. 68.</ref>

[[File:Medallion of Justinian I.jpg|thumb|A golden medallion celebrating the reconquest of [[Africa]], AD 534]]

In this war, the contemporary [[Procopius]] remarks that Africa was so entirely depopulated that a person might travel several days without meeting a human being, and he adds, "it is no exaggeration to say, that in the course of the war 5,000,000 perished by the sword, and famine, and pestilence."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mavor |first=William Fordyce |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uaCgjEAmUfEC&pg=RA1-PA81 |title=Universal History, Ancient and Modern: From the Earliest Records of Time, to the General Peace of 1801 |date=1802 |publisher=R.

====War in Italy, first phase, 535–540====
{{Main|Gothic War (535–554)}}
[[File:Empèri Bizantin - Rèine de Justinian.png|thumb|Justinian's conquests]]

As in Africa, dynastic struggles in [[Ostrogothic Italy]] provided an opportunity for intervention. The young king [[Athalaric]] had died on 2 October 534, and a usurper, [[Theodahad]], had imprisoned queen [[Amalasuintha]], Theodoric's daughter and mother of Athalaric, on the island of Martana in [[Lake Bolsena]], where he had her assassinated in 535. Thereupon Belisarius, with 7,500 men,<ref name="Norw">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 215</ref> invaded Sicily (535) and advanced into Italy, sacking [[Naples]] and capturing Rome on 9 December 536. By that time Theodahad had been deposed by the Ostrogothic army, who had elected [[Vitigis]] as their new king. He gathered a large army and besieged Rome from February 537 to March 538 without being able to retake the city.{{sfn|Rosen|2007|pp=153–155}}

Justinian sent another general, [[Narses]], to Italy, but tensions between Narses and Belisarius hampered the progress of the campaign. [[Milan]] was taken, but was soon recaptured and razed by the Ostrogoths. Justinian recalled Narses in 539. By then the military situation had turned in favour of the Romans, and in 540 Belisarius [[Siege of Ravenna (539–540)|reached]] the Ostrogothic capital [[Ravenna]]. There he was offered the title of Western Roman Emperor by the Ostrogoths at the same time that envoys of Justinian were arriving to negotiate a peace that would leave the region north of the [[Po River]] in Gothic hands. Belisarius feigned acceptance of the offer, entered the city in May 540, and reclaimed it for the Empire.<ref>Moorhead (1994), pp. 84–86.</ref> Then, having been recalled by Justinian, Belisarius returned to Constantinople, taking the captured [[Vitigis]] and his wife [[Matasuntha]] with him.<ref name="AbbottLay1900">{{cite book|author1=John Stevens Cabot Abbott|author2=Wilfred C.

====War with the Sassanid Empire, 540–562====
{{main|Lazic War}}
[[File:Roman-Persian Frontier, 565 AD.png|thumb|alt=Map showing Roman-Persian frontier in 565 AD|Map of the Byzantine–Sasanian frontier in 565. In 541, the small but strategic region of [[Lazica]] on the eastern shore of the Black Sea became the new battlefield of the [[Roman–Persian Wars]].]]

Belisarius had been recalled in the face of renewed hostilities by the [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]]. Following a revolt against the Empire in [[Marzpanate Period|Armenia]] in the late 530s and possibly motivated by the pleas of Ostrogothic ambassadors, King [[Khosrau I]] broke the "Eternal Peace" and invaded Roman territory in the spring of 540.<ref>See for this section Moorhead (1994), pp. 89 ff., Greatrex (2005), p. 488 ff., and especially H. Börm, "Der Perserkönig im Imperium Romanum", in ''Chiron'' 36, 2006, pp. 299 ff.</ref> He first sacked [[Aleppo|Beroea]] and then [[Antioch]] (allowing the garrison of 6,000 men to leave the city),<ref name="gold2">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 229</ref> besieged [[Daras]], and then went on to attack the Byzantine base in the small but strategically significant satellite kingdom of [[Lazic War|Lazica]] near the Black Sea as requested by its discontented king [[Gubazes II of Lazica|Gubazes]], exacting tribute from the towns he passed along his way. He forced Justinian I to pay him 5,000 pounds of gold, plus 500 pounds of gold more each year.<ref name="gold2"/>

Belisarius arrived in the East in 541, but after some success, was again recalled to Constantinople in 542. The reasons for his withdrawal are not known, but it may have been instigated by rumours of his disloyalty reaching the court.<ref>Procopius mentions this event both in the ''Wars'' and in the ''Secret History'', but gives two entirely different explanations for it. The evidence is briefly discussed in Moorhead (1994), pp. 97–98.</ref> 
The outbreak of the plague coupled with a rebellion in Persia brought Khosrow I's offensives to a halt. Exploiting this, Justinian ordered all the forces in the East to invade Persian Armenia, but the 30,000-strong Byzantine force was defeated by a small force at [[Battle of Anglon|Anglon]].<ref name="Nor2">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 235</ref> The next year, Khosrau unsuccessfully [[Siege of Edessa (544)|besieged]] the major city of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. Both parties made little headway, and in 545 a truce was agreed upon for the southern part of the Roman-Persian frontier. After that, the [[Lazic War]] in the North continued for several years: the Lazic king switched to the Byzantine side, and in 549 Justinian sent [[Dagisthaeus]] to [[Siege of Petra (549)|recapture Petra]], but he faced heavy resistance and the siege was relieved by Sasanian reinforcements. Justinian replaced him with [[Bessas (magister militum)|Bessas]], who was under a cloud after the loss of Rome in 546, but he managed to [[Siege of Petra (550–551)|capture and dismantle Petra]] in 551. The war continued for several years until a second truce in 557, followed by a [[Fifty-Year Peace Treaty|fifty years' peace]] in 562. Under its terms, the Persians agreed to abandon Lazica in exchange for an annual tribute of 400 or 500 pounds of gold (30,000 ''solidi'') to be paid by the Romans.<ref>Moorhead ((1994), p. 164) gives the lower, Greatrex ((2005), p. 489) the higher figure.</ref>

====War in Italy, second phase, 541–554====
[[File:Spanish Visigothic gold tremisses in the name of emperor Justinian I with cross on breast 7th century.jpg|thumb|[[Visigothic Kingdom|Spanish Visigothic]] gold [[Tremissis]] in the name of emperor Justinian I, 7th century.

While military efforts were directed to the East, the situation in Italy took a turn for the worse. Under their respective kings [[Ildibad]] and [[Eraric]] (both murdered in 541) and especially [[Totila]], the Ostrogoths made quick gains. After a [[Battle of Faventia|victory]] at [[Faenza]] in 542, they reconquered the major cities of Southern Italy and soon held almost the entire Italian Peninsula. Belisarius was sent back to Italy late in 544 but lacked sufficient troops and supplies. Making no headway, he was relieved of his command in 548. Belisarius succeeded in defeating a Gothic fleet of 200 ships.<ref>{{Cite book |last=D’Amato |first=Raffaele |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9aRWDgAAQBAJ |title=Imperial Roman Warships 193–565 AD |date=2017-02-23 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4728-1827-0 |pages=44 |language=en}}</ref> During this period the city of Rome changed hands three more times, first [[Sack of Rome (546)|taken and depopulated]] by the Ostrogoths in December 546, then reconquered by the Byzantines in 547, and then again by the Goths in January 550. Totila also plundered [[Sicily]] and attacked Greek coastlines.{{sfn|Bury|1958|pp=233–238}}

Finally, Justinian dispatched a force of approximately 35,000 men (2,000 men were detached and sent to invade southern Visigothic Hispania) under the command of Narses.<ref name="Nor3">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 251</ref> The army reached Ravenna in June 552 and defeated the Ostrogoths decisively within a month at the [[battle of Busta Gallorum]] in the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], where Totila was slain. After a second battle at [[Battle of Mons Lactarius|Mons Lactarius]] in October that year, the resistance of the Ostrogoths was finally broken. In 554, a large-scale [[Franks|Frankish]] invasion was defeated at [[Battle of Casilinum|Casilinum]], and Italy was secured for the Empire, though it would take Narses several years to reduce the remaining Gothic strongholds. At the end of the war, Italy was garrisoned with an army of 16,000 men.<ref name="Nor">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 233</ref> The recovery of Italy cost the empire about 300,000 pounds of gold.<ref name="tulane.edu"/> Procopius estimated 15,000,000 Goths died.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1YBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA82|title=Universal history, ancient and modern|date=1 March 1802|via=Google Books|last1=Mavor|first1=William Fordyce}}</ref>

====Other campaigns====
[[File:4KJUSTINIAN.png|thumb|Emperor Justinian reconquered many former territories of the Western Roman Empire, including [[Roman Italy|Italia]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], Africa, and southern [[Hispania]].]]

In addition to the other conquests, the Empire established a presence in [[Visigothic]] [[Hispania]], when the usurper [[Athanagild]] requested assistance in his rebellion against King [[Agila I]]. In 552, Justinian dispatched a force of 2,000 men; according to the historian [[Jordanes]], this army was led by the octogenarian [[Liberius (praetorian prefect)|Liberius]].<ref>''Getica'', 303</ref> The Byzantines took [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] and other cities on the southeastern coast and founded the new province of [[Spania]] before being checked by their former ally Athanagild, who had by now become king. This campaign marked the apogee of Byzantine expansion.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

During Justinian's reign, the [[Balkans]] suffered from several incursions by the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Slavic peoples]] who lived north of the [[Danube]]. Here, Justinian resorted mainly to a combination of diplomacy and a system of defensive works. In 559 a particularly dangerous invasion of [[Slavic peoples|Sklavinoi]] and [[Kutrigurs]] under their [[Khan (title)|khan]] [[Zabergan]] threatened Constantinople, but they were repulsed by the aged general Belisarius.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Evans|first=James Allan|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/843198707|title=The Power Game in Byzantium : Antonina and the Empress Theodora.|date=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-2040-3|location=London|pages=205–206|oclc=843198707}}</ref>

====Results====
Justinian's ambition to restore the Roman Empire to its former glory was only partly realized, with the only noteworthy sustainable [[Byzantine North Africa|conquests in Africa]]. In the West, the brilliant early military successes of the 530s were followed by years of stagnation. The dragging war with the Goths was a disaster for Italy, even though its long-lasting effects may have been less severe than is sometimes thought.<ref>See Lee (2005), pp. 125 ff.</ref> The heavy taxes that the administration imposed upon Italian population were deeply resented.<ref>{{cite book |last=Amory |first=Patrick |author-link=Patrick Amory |year=1997 |title=People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489&ndash;554 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=176 |isbn=0-521-57151-0}}</ref>

The final victory in Italy and the conquest of Africa and the coast of southern [[Hispania]] significantly enlarged the area of Byzantine influence and eliminated all naval threats to the empire, which in 555 reached its territorial zenith. Despite losing much of Italy soon after Justinian's death, the empire retained several important cities, including Rome, Naples, and Ravenna, leaving the [[Lombards]] as a regional threat. The newly founded province of Spania kept the Visigoths as a threat to Hispania alone and not to the western Mediterranean and Africa.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Events of the later years of his reign showed that Constantinople itself was not safe from barbarian incursions from the north, and even the relatively benevolent historian [[Menander Protector]] felt the need to attribute the Emperor's failure to protect the capital to the weakness of his body in his old age.<ref>W. Pohl, "Justinian and the Barbarian Kingdoms", in Maas (2005), pp. 448–476; 472</ref> In his efforts to renew the Roman Empire, Justinian dangerously stretched its resources while failing to take into account the changed realities of 6th-century Europe.<ref>See Haldon (2003), pp. 17–19.</ref>

===Religious activities===
[[File:Sanvitale03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[mosaic]] showing [[Justinian]] with [[Maximianus of Ravenna|the bishop]] of [[Ravenna]] (Italy), bodyguards, and courtiers<ref name=Adams158>Adams ''History of Western Art'' pp. 158–159</ref>]]

Justinian saw the orthodoxy of his empire threatened by diverging religious currents, especially [[monophysitism]], which had many adherents in the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt. Monophysite doctrine, which maintains that Jesus Christ had one divine nature rather than a synthesis of divine and human nature, had been condemned as a [[heresy]] by the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, and the tolerant policies towards Monophysitism of [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] had been a source of tension in the relationship with the bishops of Rome.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=207–250}}

Justin reversed this trend and confirmed the Chalcedonian doctrine, openly condemning the Monophysites. Justinian, who continued this policy, tried to impose religious unity on his subjects by forcing them to accept doctrinal compromises that might appeal to all parties, a policy that proved unsuccessful as he satisfied none of them.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=207–250}}

Near the end of his life, Justinian became ever more inclined towards the Monophysite doctrine, especially in the form of [[Aphthartodocetae|Aphthartodocetism]], but he died before being able to issue any legislation. The empress Theodora sympathized with the Monophysites and is said to have been a constant source of pro-Monophysite intrigues at the court in Constantinople in the earlier years. In the course of his reign, Justinian, who had a genuine interest in matters of theology, authored a small number of theological treatises.<ref>Treatises written by Justinian can be found in Migne's ''Patrologia Graeca'', Vol. 86.</ref>

====Religious policy====
[[File:Convent of Our Lady of Saidnaya 01.jpg|thumb|[[Our Lady of Saidnaya Monastery]], in present-day Syria, is traditionally held to have been founded by Justinian.]]

As in his secular administration, [[despotism]] appeared also in the Emperor's ecclesiastical policy. He regulated everything, both in religion and in law. At the very beginning of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]], and to threaten all [[Christian heresy|heretics]] with the appropriate penalties,<ref>''Cod.'', I., i. 5.</ref> whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by [[due process]] of law.<ref>''MPG'', lxxxvi. 1, p. 993.</ref> He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church<ref>''Cod.'', I., i. 7.</ref> and accorded legal force to the [[canon law|canons]] of the four [[ecumenical]] councils.<ref>''Novellae'', cxxxi.</ref> The bishops in attendance at the [[Council of Constantinople (536)]] recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command,<ref>Mansi, ''Concilia'', viii. 970B.</ref> while, on his side, the emperor, in the case of the [[Patriarch Anthimus I of Constantinople|Patriarch Anthimus]], reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription.<ref>''Novellae'', xlii.</ref> Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity to secure the rights of the Church and clergy, and to protect and extend [[monasticism]]. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive ''solemnia'', or annual gifts, from the [[Imperial treasury, Rome|Imperial treasury]] or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Although the despotic character of his measures is contrary to modern sensibilities, he was a "nursing father" of the Church.

====Religious relations with Rome====

From the middle of the 5th century onward, increasingly arduous tasks confronted the emperors of the East in ecclesiastical matters.
Justinian entered the arena of ecclesiastical statecraft shortly after his uncle's accession in 518, and put an end to the [[Acacian schism]]. Previous Emperors had tried to alleviate theological conflicts by declarations that deemphasized the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which had condemned [[monophysitism]], which had strongholds in Egypt and Syria, and by tolerating the appointment of Monophysites to church offices. The Popes reacted by severing ties with the Patriarch of Constantinople who supported these policies. Emperors Justin I (and later Justinian himself) rescinded these policies and reestablished the union between Constantinople and Rome.<ref>cf. ''Novellae'', cxxxi.</ref> After this, Justinian also felt entitled to settle disputes in papal elections, as he did when he favored [[Pope Vigilius|Vigilius]] and had his rival [[Pope Silverius|Silverius]] deported.{{sfn|Bury|1958|pp=378–379}}

On her right side stands Justinian, offering a model of the Hagia Sophia. On her left, [[Constantine I]] presents a model of Constantinople.]]

This new-found unity between East and West did not, however, solve the ongoing disputes in the east. Justinian's policies switched between attempts to force Monophysites and Miaphysites (who were mistaken to be adherers of Monophysitism) to accept the Chalcedonian creed by persecuting their bishops and monks – thereby embittering their sympathizers in Egypt and other provinces – and attempts at a compromise that would win over the Monophysites without surrendering the Chalcedonian faith. Such an approach was supported by the Empress Theodora, who favoured the Miaphysites unreservedly. In the condemnation of the [[Three-Chapter Controversy|''Three Chapters'']], three theologians that had opposed Monophysitism before and after the Council of Chalcedon, Justinian tried to win over the opposition. At the [[Fifth Ecumenical Council]], most of the Eastern church yielded to the Emperor's demands, and [[Pope Vigilius]], who was forcibly brought to Constantinople and besieged at a chapel, finally also gave his assent. However, the condemnation was received unfavourably in the west, where it led to new (albeit temporal) schism, and failed to reach its goal in the east, as the Monophysites remained unsatisfied – all the more bitter for him because during his last years he took an even greater interest in theological matters.{{sfn|Bury|1958|pp=372–384}}

Justinian's religious policy reflected the conviction that the unity of the Empire presupposed unity of faith, and it appeared to him obvious that this faith could only be the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|orthodoxy (Chalcedonian)]]. Those of a different belief were subjected to persecution, which imperial legislation had effected from the time of [[Constantius II]] and which would now vigorously continue. The ''Codex'' contained two [[statute]]s<ref>''Cod.'', I., xi. 9 and 10.</ref> that decreed the total destruction of [[paganism]], even in private life; these provisions were zealously enforced. Contemporary sources (John Malalas, [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]], and [[John of Ephesus]]) tell of severe persecutions, including men in high positions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sarris |first1=Peter |title=Justinian: emperor, soldier, saint |date=2023 |publisher=Basic Books |location=London |isbn=9781529365399 |page=279}}</ref>

The original [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] of Plato had been [[Siege of Athens and Piraeus (87–86 BC)|destroyed]] by the Roman dictator [[Sulla]] in 86 BC. Several centuries later, in 410 AD, a [[Neoplatonic Academy]] was established that had no institutional continuity with Plato's Academy, and which served as a center for [[Neoplatonism]] and mysticism. It persisted until 529 AD when it was finally closed by Justinian I. Other schools in Constantinople, Antioch, and Alexandria, which were the centers of Justinian's empire, continued.<ref>Lindberg, David C. "The Beginnings of Western Science", p. 70</ref>

In [[Asia Minor]] alone, John of Ephesus was reported to have [[christianization|converted]] 70,000 pagans, which was probably an exaggerated number.<ref>[[François Nau]], in ''Revue de l'orient chretien'', ii., 1897, 482.</ref> Other peoples also accepted Christianity: the [[Heruli]],<ref>Procopius, ''Bellum Gothicum'', ii. 14; [[Evagrius Scholasticus|Evagrius]], ''Hist. eccl.'', iv. 20</ref> the [[Huns]] dwelling near the [[Don River, Russia|Don]],<ref>Procopius, iv. 4; Evagrius, iv. 23.</ref> the [[Abkhaz people|Abasgi]],<ref>Procopius, iv. 3; Evagrius, iv. 22.</ref> and the [[Tzanni]] in [[Caucasus|Caucasia]].<ref>Procopius, ''Bellum Persicum'', i. 15.</ref>

The Emperor faced significant opposition from the [[Samaritan]]s, who resisted conversion to Christianity and were repeatedly in insurrection. He persecuted them with rigorous edicts, for example, in 529, he banned them from having wills, an intentional act of humiliation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sarris |first1=Peter |title=Justinian: emperor, soldier, saint |date=2023 |publisher=Basic Books |location=London |isbn=9781529365399 |page=283}}</ref> However, he could not prevent reprisals towards Christians from taking place in Samaria toward the close of his reign.

===Architecture, learning, art and literature===

Justinian was a prolific builder; the historian Procopius bears witness to his activities in this area.<ref>See Procopius, ''Buildings''.</ref> Under Justinian's reign, the [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]] in Ravenna, which features two famous mosaics representing Justinian and Theodora, was completed under the sponsorship of Julius Argentarius.<ref name=dotma>Robert Browning. "Justinian I" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', volume VII (1986).</ref> Most notably, he had the [[Hagia Sophia]], originally a [[basilica]]-style church that had been burnt down during the [[Nika riots]], splendidly rebuilt according to a completely different ground plan, under the architectural supervision of [[Isidore of Miletus]] and [[Anthemius of Tralles]]. On 26 December 537, according to Pseudo-Codinus, Justinian stated at the completion of this edifice: "Solomon, I have outdone thee" (in reference to the first Jewish temple). The church had a second inauguration on 24 December 562, after several reworks made by [[Isidore the Younger]]. This new cathedral, with its magnificent dome filled with mosaics, remained the centre of eastern Christianity for centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barker|first=John W.|title=Justinian and the Later Roman Empire|date=1966|page=183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiJljEXvwAoC&pg=PA183|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299039448|access-date=9 August 2023|archive-date=7 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307051544/https://books.google.com/books?id=LiJljEXvwAoC&pg=PA183|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Basilica of Hagia Sofia, Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|The present [[Saint Sophia Church, Sofia|Basilica of Saint Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria]], is believed to be the fifth structure to be constructed on the site and was built during the reign of Emperor Justinian I.]]

Another prominent church in the capital, the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], which had been in a very poor state near the end of the 5th century, was likewise rebuilt.<ref>Vasiliev (1952), p. 189</ref> The Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, later renamed [[Little Hagia Sophia]], was also built between 532 and 536 by the imperial couple.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bardill|first=Jonathan|date=2017|title=The Date, Dedication, and Design of Sts.

Justinian also strengthened the borders of the Empire from Africa to the East through the construction of fortifications and ensured Constantinople of its water supply through construction of underground [[cisterns]] (see [[Basilica Cistern]]). To prevent floods from damaging the strategically important border town [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]], [[Dara Dam|an advanced arch dam]] was built. During his reign the large [[Sangarius Bridge]] was built in [[Bithynia]], securing a major military supply route to the east. Furthermore, Justinian restored cities damaged by earthquake or war and built a new city near his place of birth called [[Justiniana Prima]], which was intended to replace [[Thessalonica]] as the political and religious centre of [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]].{{sfn|Turlej|2016|pp=47–86}}

In Justinian's reign, and partly under his patronage, Byzantine culture produced noteworthy historians, including Procopius and [[Agathias]], and poets such as [[Paul the Silentiary]] and [[Romanus the Singer|Romanus the Melodist]] flourished. On the other hand, centres of learning such as the Neoplatonic Academy in Athens and the famous [[Law School of Berytus]]<ref>Following a terrible earthquake in 551, the school at Berytus was transferred to Sidon and had no further significance after that date. (Vasiliev (1952), p. 147)</ref> lost their importance during his reign.{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=369}}

===Economy and administration===

As was the case under Justinian's predecessors, the Empire's economic health rested primarily on agriculture. In addition, long-distance trade flourished, reaching as far north as [[Cornwall]] where tin was exchanged for Roman wheat.<ref>John F. Haldon, "Economy and Administration", in Michael Maas (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to the Age of Justinian'' (Cambridge 2005), pp. 28–59 (p. 35)</ref> Within the Empire, convoys sailing from [[Alexandria]] provided Constantinople with wheat and grains. Justinian made the traffic more efficient by building a large granary on the island of [[Ancient Tenedos|Tenedos]] for storage and further transport to Constantinople.<ref>John Moorhead, ''Justinian'' (London/New York 1994), p. 57</ref> Justinian also tried to find new routes for the eastern trade, which was suffering badly from the wars with the Persians.

One important luxury product was silk, which was imported and then processed in the Empire. In order to protect the manufacture of silk products, Justinian granted a monopoly to the imperial factories in 541.<ref>Peter Brown, ''The World of Late Antiquity'' (London 1971), pp. 157–158</ref> In order to bypass the Persian landroute, Justinian established friendly relations with the [[Kingdom of Axum|Abyssinians]], whom he wanted to act as trade mediators by transporting Indian silk to the Empire; the Abyssinians, however, were unable to compete with the Persian merchants in India.<ref>Vasiliev (1952), p. 167</ref> Then, in the early 550s, two monks succeeded in [[Smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire|smuggling eggs of silk worms]] from [[Central Asia]] back to Constantinople,<ref>See Moorhead (1994), p. 167; Procopius, ''Wars'', 8.17.1–8</ref> and silk became an indigenous product.

Greater administrative power was given to both the leaders of the [[prefectures]] and of the provinces, while power was taken away from the [[vicarius|vicariates]] of the [[dioceses]], of which a number were abolished. The overall trend was towards a simplification of administrative infrastructure.<ref>Haldon (2005), p. 50</ref> According to [[Peter Brown (historian)|Brown]] (1971), the increased professionalization of tax collection did much to destroy the traditional structures of provincial life, as it weakened the autonomy of the town councils in the Greek towns.<ref>Brown (1971), p. 157</ref> It has been estimated that before Justinian I's reconquests the state had an annual revenue of 5,000,000 ''solidi'' in AD 530, but after his reconquests, the annual revenue was increased to 6,000,000 ''solidi'' in AD 550.<ref name="tulane.edu"/>

Throughout Justinian's reign, the cities and villages of the East thrived, although [[Antioch]] was struck by two earthquakes (526, 528) and sacked and evacuated by the [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]] (540). Justinian had the city rebuilt, but on a slightly smaller scale.<ref>Kenneth G. Holum, "The Classical City in the Sixth Century", in Michael Maas (ed.), ''Age of Justinian'' (2005), pp. 99–100</ref>

Despite all these measures, the Empire suffered several major setbacks in the course of the 6th century. The first one was the plague, which lasted from 541 to 543 and, by decimating the Empire's population, probably created a scarcity of labor and a rising of wages.<ref>Moorhead (1994), pp. 100–101</ref> The lack of manpower also led to a significant increase in the number of "barbarians" in the Byzantine armies after the early 540s.<ref>John L. Teall, "The Barbarians in Justinian's Armies", in ''Speculum'', vol. 40, No. 2, 1965, 294–322. The total strength of the Byzantine army under Justinian is estimated at 150,000 men (J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 259).</ref> The protracted war in Italy and the wars with the Persians themselves laid a heavy burden on the Empire's resources, and Justinian was criticized for curtailing the government-run post service, which he limited to only one eastern route of military importance.<ref>Brown (1971), p. 158; Moorhead (1994), p. 101</ref>

In the ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' section of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Canto (chapter) VI, by [[Dante Alighieri]], Justinian I is prominently featured as a spirit residing on the sphere of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. The latter holds in [[Heaven]] the souls of those whose acts were righteous, yet meant to achieve fame and honor. Justinian's legacy is elaborated on, and he is portrayed as a defender of the Christian faith and the restorer of Rome to the Empire. Justinian confesses that he was partially motivated by fame rather than duty to God, which tainted the justice of his rule in spite of his proud accomplishments. In his introduction, "Cesare fui e son Iustinïano" ("Caesar I was, and am Justinian"<ref>''Paradiso'', Canto VI verse 10</ref>), his mortal title is contrasted with his immortal soul, to emphasize that "glory in life is ephemeral, while contributing to God's glory is eternal", according to [[Dorothy L. Sayers]].<ref>Dorothy L. Sayers, Paradiso, notes on Canto VI.</ref> Dante also uses Justinian to criticize the factious politics of his 14th-century Italy, divided between Ghibellines and Guelphs, in contrast to the unified Italy of the Roman Empire.

Justinian is a major character in the 1938 novel ''[[Count Belisarius]]'', by Robert Graves. He is depicted as a jealous and conniving Emperor obsessed with creating and maintaining his own historical legacy.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cournos |first=John |date=November 20, 1938 |orig-date=November 20, 1938 |title=A Rich Novel by Robert Graves: In "Count Belisarius" He Offers Another Vivid Picture of Ancient Times, Here the Period of Justinian |language=en |work=The New York Times |page=92|quote=..."petty, envious masters.

In the 1968 West German-Italian historical drama film ''[[Kampf um Rom]]'' (English language title: The Last Roman) Justinian is played by [[Orson Welles]].

In the 1985 Soviet film ''[[Primary Russia]]'' Justinian is played by [[Innokenty Smoktunovsky]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

Justinian is a chief protagonist of Belisarius in "Empire in Apocalypse" by Robert Bruton (Legend Books 2023). The emperor's jealousy and envy of Belisarius eventually prompt him to undermine his best general.

Justinian occasionally appears in the comic strip ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', usually as a nemesis of the title character.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

Justinian's Crown is a historical artifact claimed by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the popular 2020 computer strategy game ''[[Crusader Kings 3]]'', by [[Paradox Development Studio]].<ref>Paradox Wiki's,  Historical Artifacts https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Artifacts {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230730153805/https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Artifacts |date=30 July 2023 }}.</ref>

==Historical sources==
[[Procopius]] provides the primary source for the history of Justinian's reign, but his opinion is tainted by a feeling of betrayal when Justinian became more pragmatic and less idealistic (Justinian and the Later Roman Empire by John W. Barker). He became very bitter towards Justinian and his empress, [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Theodora]].{{efn|While he glorified Justinian's achievements in his panegyric and his ''Wars'', Procopius also wrote a hostile account, [[Historia Arcana|''Anekdota'']] (the so-called ''Secret History''), in which Justinian is depicted as a cruel, venal, and incompetent ruler.The [[Syriac language|Syriac]] chronicle of [[John of Ephesus]], which survives partially, was used as a source for later chronicles, contributing many additional details of value. Other sources include the writings of John Malalas, [[Agathias]], [[John the Lydian]], [[Menander Protector]], the [[Paschal Chronicle]], [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor, [[Jordanes]], the chronicles of [[Marcellinus Comes]] and [[Victor of Tunnuna]]. Justinian is widely regarded as a [[saint]] by [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], and is also commemorated by some [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches on 14 November.}} In various Eastern Orthodox Churches, including the [[Orthodox Church in America]], Justinian and his empress Theodora are commemorated on the anniversary of his death, 14 November. Some denominations translate the [[Julian calendar]] date to 27 November on the [[Gregorian calendar]]. The [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] and the [[Lutheran Church–Canada]] also commemorate Justinian on 14 November.
