'''Charles Lutwidge Dodgson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ʌ|t|w|ɪ|dʒ|_|ˈ|d|ɒ|d|s|ən}} {{respell|LUT|wij|_|DOD|sən}}; 27 January 1832 – 14 January 1898), better known by his [[pen name]] '''Lewis Carroll''', was an English author, poet, mathematician, photographer and Anglican [[deacon]]. His most notable works are ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) and its sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1871). He was noted for his facility with [[word play]], logic, and fantasy. His poems ''[[Jabberwocky]]'' (1871) and ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'' (1876) are classified in the genre of [[literary nonsense]]. Some of Alice's nonsensical wonderland logic reflects his published work on mathematical logic.

Carroll came from a family of [[high-church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], and pursued his clerical training at Oxford [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he lived for most of his life as a scholar, teacher and Anglican [[deacon]]. [[Alice Liddell]] – a daughter of [[Henry Liddell]], the [[Dean of Christ Church, Oxford|Dean of Christ Church]] – is widely identified as the original inspiration for ''Alice in Wonderland'', though Carroll always denied this.

An avid puzzler, Carroll created the [[word ladder]] puzzle (which he then called "Doublets"), which he published in his weekly column for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine between 1879 and 1881. In 1982 a memorial stone to Carroll was unveiled at [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]. There are societies in many parts of the world dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk/pages/eventspeopleplaces/societies.html |title=Lewis Carroll Societies |publisher=Lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk |access-date=7 October 2020 |archive-date=29 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329191009/http://lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk/pages/eventspeopleplaces/societies.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.profile&ein=132904564 Lewis Carroll Society of North America Inc.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220326161848/https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/132904564 |date=26 March 2022 }} Charity Navigator.

== Early life ==

Dodgson's family was predominantly [[Northern England|northern English]], [[Conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservative]], and [[high-church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]. Most of his male ancestors were army officers or Anglican clergymen. His great-grandfather, [[Charles Dodgson (bishop)|Charles Dodgson]], had risen through the ranks of the church to become the [[Bishop of Elphin]] in rural Ireland.<ref>[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&nbsp;10</ref> His paternal grandfather, also named Charles, was an army captain killed in the [[Irish rebellion of 1803]], when his two sons were hardly more than babies.<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], pp. 6–7</ref> The older of these sons, yet another [[Charles Dodgson (priest)|Charles Dodgson]], was Carroll's father. He went to [[Rugby School]] and then to [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>Bakewell, Michael (1996). ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography''. London: Heinemann. p. 2. {{ISBN|9780434045792}}.</ref> He reverted to the other family tradition and took [[holy orders]]. He was mathematically gifted and won a [[double first]] degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead, he became a country [[parson]].<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], p.&nbsp;8</ref><ref name="kqihew">[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 30–35</ref>

Dodgson was born on 27 January 1832 at All Saints' Vicarage in [[Daresbury]], [[Cheshire]],<ref>{{cite book|last=McCulloch|first=Fiona|chapter=Lewis Carroll|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature. Vol. 3: Harr—Mirr|editor-last=Kastan|editor-first=David Scott|location=Oxford, U.K.|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006|isbn=9780195169218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlMUSz-hiuEC|page=386}}</ref> the oldest boy and the third oldest of 11 children. When he was 11, his father was given the [[Benefice#Church of England|living]] of [[Croft-on-Tees]], Yorkshire, and the whole family moved to the spacious rectory. This remained their home for the next 25 years. Charles' father was an active and highly conservative [[Clergy|cleric]] of the [[Church of England]] who later became the [[Archdeacon of Richmond]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dodgson.html|title=Charles Lutwidge Dodgson|work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|access-date=8 March 2011|archive-date=5 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705045009/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dodgson.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was high-church, inclining toward [[Anglo-Catholicism]], an admirer of [[John Henry Newman]] and the [[Tractarian movement]], and did his best to instil such views in his children. However, Charles developed an ambivalent relationship with his father's values and with the [[Church of England]] as a whole.<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 200–202</ref>

During his early youth, Dodgson was educated at home. His "reading lists" preserved in the family archives testify to a precocious intellect: at the age of seven, he was reading books such as ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''. He also spoke with a [[Stuttering|stammer]] – a condition shared by most of his siblings<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;4</ref> – that often inhibited his social life throughout his years. At the age of twelve he was sent to Richmond Grammar School (now part of [[Richmond School]]) in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]].

In 1846, Dodgson entered [[Rugby School]], where he was evidently unhappy, as he wrote some years after leaving: "I cannot say ... that any earthly considerations would induce me to go through my three years again ... I can honestly say that if I could have been ... secure from annoyance at night, the hardships of the daily life would have been comparative trifles to bear."<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], pp. 30–31</ref> He did not claim he suffered from bullying, but cited little boys as the main targets of older bullies at Rugby.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Mystery of Lewis Carroll: Discovering the Whimsical, Thoughtful, and Sometimes Lonely Man Who Created "Alice in Wonderland"|last=Woolf|first=Jenny|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2010|isbn=9780312612986|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mysteryoflewisca0000wool/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/mysteryoflewisca0000wool/page/24}}</ref> Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, Dodgson's nephew, wrote that "even though it is hard for those who have only known him as the gentle and retiring don to believe it, it is nevertheless true that long after he left school, his name was remembered as that of a boy who knew well how to use his fists in defence of a righteous cause", which is the protection of the smaller boys.<ref name=":0" />

Dodgson|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|date=2005|isbn=0786421053|pages=329}}</ref>

He left Rugby at the end of 1849 and [[matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in May 1850 as a member of his father's old college, [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]].<ref>[[#Clark|Clark]], pp. 63–64</ref> After waiting for rooms in college to become available, he went into residence in January 1851.<ref name=clark6465>[[#Clark|Clark]], pp. 64–65</ref> He had been at Oxford only two days when he received a summons home.

His early academic career veered between high promise and irresistible distraction. He did not always work hard, but was exceptionally gifted, and achievement came easily to him. In 1852, he obtained [[first-class honours]] in Mathematics [[Moderations]] and was soon afterwards nominated to a [[Christ Church, Oxford#Governing body|Studentship]] by his father's old friend Canon [[Edward Pusey]].<ref name=collingwood52>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], p.&nbsp;52</ref><ref name=clark74>[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&nbsp;74</ref> In 1854, he obtained first-class honours in the Final Honours School of Mathematics, standing first on the list, and thus graduated as Bachelor of Arts.<ref name=collingwood57>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], p.&nbsp;57</ref><ref name=wilson>[[#Wilson|Wilson]], p.&nbsp;51</ref> He remained at Christ Church studying and teaching, but the next year he failed an important scholarship exam through his self-confessed inability to apply himself to study.<ref name=cohen51>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;51</ref><ref name=clark79>[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&nbsp;79</ref> Even so, his talent as a mathematician won him the Christ Church Mathematical Lectureship in 1855,<ref name=frw41>{{cite book | title=Mathematics in Victorian Britain | first1=Raymond |last1=Flood | first2=Adrian |last2=Rice | first3=Robin |last3=Wilson | author3-link=Robin Wilson (mathematician) | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | location=Oxfordshire, England|date=2011 | isbn=978-0-19-960139-4 |oclc=721931689 | page=41 }}</ref> which he continued to hold for the next 26 years.<ref name=cohen414-6>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 414–416</ref> Despite early unhappiness, Dodgson remained at Christ Church, in various capacities, until his death, including that of Sub-Librarian of the Christ Church library, where his office was close to the Deanery, where Alice Liddell lived.<ref name = "ekfvyz">[[#Leach|Leach]], Ch. 2.</ref>

== Character and appearance ==

=== Health problems ===

[[File:Lewis Carroll 1863.jpg|thumb|upright|1863 photograph of Carroll by [[Oscar G. Rejlander]]]]
The young adult Charles Dodgson was about {{convert|6|ft|2}} tall and slender, and he had curly brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]], and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of [[Pertussis|whooping cough]], which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. In early childhood, he acquired a [[Stuttering|stammer]], which he referred to as his "hesitation"; it remained throughout his life.<ref name = "ekfvyz"/>

The stammer has always been a significant part of the image of Dodgson. While one apocryphal story says that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, there is no evidence to support this idea.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;91</ref> Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer, while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people whom he met; it is said that he caricatured himself as the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]] in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many supposed facts often repeated for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as a dodo, but whether or not this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation.<ref name = "ekfvyz"/>

Dodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He could reportedly sing at a passable level and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was also adept at mimicry and storytelling, and reputedly quite good at [[charades]].<ref name="ekfvyz"/>

=== Social connections ===

In the interim between his early published writings and the success of the ''Alice'' books, Dodgson began to move in the [[pre-Raphaelite]] social circle. He first met [[John Ruskin]] in 1857 and became friendly with him. Around 1863, he developed a close relationship with [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and his family. He would often take pictures of the family in the garden of the Rossetti's house in [[Chelsea, London]]. He also knew [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Everett Millais]], and [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], among other artists. He knew fairy-tale author [[George MacDonald]] well – it was the enthusiastic reception of ''Alice'' by the young MacDonald children that persuaded him to submit the work for publication.<ref name="ekfvyz"/><ref name="snaogq">[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 100–4</ref>

=== Politics, religion, and philosophy ===

In broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. [[Martin Gardner]] labels Dodgson as a [[Tory]] who was "awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors".<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to The annotated Alice: Alice's adventures in Wonderland & Through the looking glass|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|year=2000|page=xv|isbn=0-517-02962-6}}</ref> [[William Tuckwell]], in his ''Reminiscences of Oxford'' (1900), regarded him as "austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape".<ref>{{cite book | title = Introduction to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass | last = Gardner | first = Martin | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | page = xvi | isbn = 978-0-517-02962-6 }}</ref> Dodgson was ordained a deacon in the Church of England on 22 December 1861. In ''The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll'', the editor states that "his Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the future."<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]]</ref> When a friend asked him about his religious views, Dodgson wrote in response that he was a member of the [[Church of England]], but "doubt[ed] if he was fully a 'High Churchman{{' "}}. He added:
{{Blockquote|I believe that when you and I come to lie down for the last time, if only we can keep firm hold of the great truths Christ taught us—our own utter worthlessness and His infinite worth; and that He has brought us back to our one Father, and made us His brethren, and so brethren to one another—we shall have all we need to guide us through the shadows. Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer to—that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially say, "I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross of Calvary."|Carroll (1897)<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], Chapter IX</ref>}}

Dodgson also expressed interest in other fields. He was an early member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], and one of his letters suggests that he accepted as real what was then called "thought reading".<ref>{{cite book | title = The Society for Psychical Research, 1882–1982 A History | last = Hayness | first = Rene&#769;e | publisher = Macdonald & Co | place = London | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-356-07875-2 | pages = 13–14 }}</ref> Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments. In 1895, he developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning in his article "[[What the Tortoise Said to Achilles]]", which appeared in one of the early volumes of ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal | volume=IV| doi = 10.1093/mind/IV.14.278| title = What the Tortoise Said to Achilles| journal = Mind| issue = 14| pages = 278–280| year = 1895| last1 = Carroll | first1 = L.  |issn=0026-4423}}</ref> The article was reprinted in the same journal a hundred years later in 1995, with a subsequent article by [[Simon Blackburn]] titled "Practical Tortoise Raising".<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/mind/104.416.695| title = Practical Tortoise Raising| journal = Mind| volume = 104| issue = 416| pages = 695–711| year = 1995| last1 = Blackburn | first1 = S. }}</ref>

== Artistic activities ==

[[File:AAUG p06.png|thumb|right|alt=Head and shoulders drawing of a girl (Alice) holding a key|One of Carroll's own illustrations]]

=== Literature ===

From a young age, Dodgson wrote poetry and short stories, contributing heavily to the family magazine ''[[Mischmasch]]'' and later sending them to various magazines, enjoying moderate success. Between 1854 and 1856, his work appeared in the national publications ''The Comic Times'' and ''The Train'', as well as smaller magazines such as the ''[[Whitby Gazette]]'' and the ''Oxford Critic''. Most of this output was humorous, sometimes satirical, but his standards and ambitions were exacting. "I do not think I have yet written anything worthy of real publication (in which I do not include the ''Whitby Gazette'' or the ''Oxonian Advertiser''), but I do not despair of doing so someday," he wrote in July 1855.<ref name = "ekfvyz"/> Sometime after 1850, he did write [[marionette|puppet]] plays for his siblings' entertainment, of which one has survived: ''La Guida di Bragia''.<ref>{{Cite book| title=La Guida Di Bragia, a Ballad Opera for the Marionette Theatre| publisher=Lewis Carroll Society of North America| year=2007| chapter=Introduction| first=Peter L. |last=Heath| pages=vii–xvi| isbn=978-0-930326-15-9 }}</ref>

In March 1856, he published his first piece of work under the name that would make him famous. A romantic poem called "Solitude" appeared in ''The Train'' under the authorship of "Lewis Carroll". This pseudonym was a play on his real name: ''Lewis'' was the anglicised form of ''Ludovicus'', which was the Latin for ''Lutwidge'', and ''Carroll'' an Irish surname similar to the Latin name ''Carolus'', from which comes the name ''Charles''.<ref name = "kqihew"/> The transition went as follows:
"Charles Lutwidge" translated into Latin as "Carolus Ludovicus". This was then translated back into English as "Carroll Lewis" and then reversed to make "Lewis Carroll".<ref>Roger Lancelyn Green [https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/97087/Lewis-Carroll On-line Encyclopædia Britannica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509134200/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/97087/Lewis-Carroll |date=9 May 2015 }}</ref> This pseudonym was chosen by editor [[Edmund Yates]] from a list of four submitted by Dodgson, the others being Edgar Cuthwellis, Edgar U. C. Westhill, and Louis Carroll.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&nbsp;129</ref>

==== Alice books ====

[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=Illustration of Alice holding a Flamingo, standing with one foot on a curled-up hedgehog with another hedgehog walking away|"The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo". Illustration by [[John Tenniel]], 1865.]]

In 1856, Dean [[Henry Liddell]] arrived at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] at [[Oxford University]], bringing with him his young family, all of whom would figure largely in Dodgson's life over the following years, and would greatly influence his writing career. Dodgson became close friends with Liddell's wife, Lorina, and their children, particularly the three sisters Lorina, Edith, and Alice Liddell. He was widely assumed for many years to have derived his own "Alice" from [[Alice Liddell]]; the [[acrostic]] poem at the end of ''Through the Looking-Glass'' spells out her name in full, and there are also many superficial references to her hidden in the text of both books. It has been noted that Dodgson himself repeatedly denied in later life that his "little heroine" was based on any real child,<ref>Cohen, Morton N. (ed) (1979) ''The Letters of Lewis Carroll'', London: Macmillan.</ref><ref name="nbrhxm">[[#Leach|Leach]], Ch. 5 "The Unreal Alice"</ref> and he frequently dedicated his works to girls of his acquaintance, adding their names in acrostic poems at the beginning of the text. [[Gertrude Chataway]]'s name appears in this form at the beginning of ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', and it is not suggested that this means that any of the characters in the narrative are based on her.<ref name="nbrhxm"/>

Information is scarce (Dodgson's diaries for the years 1858–1862 are missing), but it seems clear that his friendship with the Liddell family was an important part of his life in the late 1850s, and he grew into the habit of taking the children on rowing trips (first the boy, Harry, and later the three girls) accompanied by an adult friend<ref name="Winchester">{{cite book| title=The Alice Behind Wonderland

It was on one such expedition on 4 July 1862 that Dodgson invented the outline of the story that eventually became his first and greatest commercial success. He told the story to Alice Liddell and she begged him to write it down, and Dodgson eventually (after much delay) presented her with a handwritten, illustrated manuscript entitled ''Alice's Adventures Under Ground'' in November 1864.<ref name="ulsdnc"/>

Before this, the family of friend and mentor [[George MacDonald]] read Dodgson's incomplete manuscript, and the enthusiasm of the MacDonald children encouraged Dodgson to seek publication. In 1863, he had taken the unfinished manuscript to [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan the publisher]], who liked it immediately. After the possible alternative titles were rejected – ''Alice Among the Fairies'' and ''Alice's Golden Hour'' – the work was finally published as ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' in 1865 under the Lewis Carroll pen-name, which Dodgson had first used some nine years earlier.<ref name="snaogq" /> The illustrations this time were by [[John Tenniel|Sir John Tenniel]]; Dodgson evidently thought that a published book would need the skills of a professional artist. Annotated versions provide insights into many of the ideas and hidden meanings that are prevalent in these books.<ref>Gardner, Martin (2000). "The Annotated Alice. The Definitive Edition". New York: W.W. Norton.</ref><ref>Heath, Peter (1974). "The Philosopher's Alice".

He was inundated with fan mail and with sometimes unwanted attention.

Late in 1871, he published the sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]''. (The title page of the first edition erroneously gives "1872" as the date of publication.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen |first=Morton |title=Introduction to "Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass"|publisher=[[Random House]] |date=24 June 2009 |isbn=978-0-553-21345-4}}</ref>) Its somewhat darker mood possibly reflects changes in Dodgson's life. His father's death in 1868 plunged him into a depression that lasted some years.<ref name="snaogq"/>

==== The Hunting of the Snark ====

In 1876, Dodgson produced his next great work, ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', a fantastical "nonsense" poem, with illustrations by [[Henry Holiday]], exploring the adventures of a bizarre crew of nine tradesmen and one beaver, who set off to find the snark. It received largely mixed reviews from Carroll's contemporary reviewers,<ref name="Hark the Snark">{{cite book|title=Lewis Carroll Observed|editor=Guilano, Edward|author=Cohen, Morton N.|year=1976|chapter=Hark the Snark|publisher=Clarkson N.

==== Sylvie and Bruno ====

In 1895, 30 years after the publication of his masterpieces, Carroll attempted a comeback, producing a two-volume tale of the fairy siblings [[Sylvie and Bruno]]. Carroll entwines two plots set in two alternative worlds, one set in rural England and the other in the fairytale kingdoms of Elfland, Outland, and others. The fairytale world satirises English society and, more specifically, the world of academia. ''Sylvie and Bruno'' came out in two volumes and is considered a lesser work, although it has remained in print for over a century.

=== Photography (1856–1880) ===

[[File:Alice Liddell 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Photo of [[Alice Liddell]] taken by Lewis Carroll (1858)]]

In 1856, Dodgson took up the new art form of photography under the influence first of his uncle [[Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge|Skeffington Lutwidge]], and later of his Oxford friend [[Reginald Southey]].<ref>[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&nbsp;93</ref> He soon excelled at the art and became a well-known gentleman-photographer, and he seems even to have toyed with the idea of making a living out of it in his very early years.<ref name = "snaogq"/>

A study by Roger Taylor and Edward Wakeling exhaustively lists every surviving print, and Taylor calculates that just over half of Dodgson's surviving work depicts young girls. Thirty surviving photographs depict nude or semi-nude children.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Elliott |first=Sarah K. |date=2017 |title=Understanding Concerns About Lewis Carroll |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/stories/articles/2017/2/6/understanding-concerns-about-lewis-carroll |access-date=14 January 2024 |website=Antiques Roadshow {{!}} PBS |language=en}}</ref> About 60% of Dodgson's original photographic portfolio was deliberately destroyed.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Roger |title=Lewis Carroll, Photographer |last2=Wakeling |first2=Edward |date=25 February 2002 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-07443-6}}</ref> Dodgson also made many studies of men, women, boys, and landscapes; his subjects also include skeletons, dolls, dogs, statues, paintings, and trees.<ref>Cohen, Morton (1999).

Dodgson also found photography to be a useful entrée into higher social circles.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&nbsp;116</ref> During the most productive part of his career, he made portraits of notable sitters such as [[John Everett Millais]], [[Ellen Terry]], [[Christopher Bullock|Maggie Spearman]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Lindsay |title=Lewis Carroll - Photography On The Move |date=2016 |publisher=REAKTION BOOKS |page=191 |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/369549917/Lewis-Carroll-Photography-on-the-Move |access-date=20 March 2024 |quote=From 1877 Carroll adopted his annual habit of listing children associated with the summer season at the Sussex resort: ‘my child friends this year at Eastbourne have been’.

By the time that Dodgson abruptly ceased photography (1880, after 24 years), he had established his own studio on the roof of [[Tom Quad]], created around 3,000 images, and become an amateur master of the medium, though fewer than 1,000 images have survived time and deliberate destruction. He stopped taking photographs because keeping his studio working was too time-consuming.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&nbsp;265</ref> He used the [[Collodion|wet collodion process]]; commercial photographers who started using the [[Dry-plate photography#Popularization|dry-plate process]] in the 1870s took pictures more quickly.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wakeling |first=Edward |title=An Exhibition From the Jon A.

He exerted his agency of this craft by literally rewriting the text created by the image to produce a new dialogue about childhood. However, popular taste changed with the advent of [[Modernism]], affecting the types of photographs that he produced.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rougeau |first1=R.

=== Inventions ===

To promote letter writing, Dodgson invented "The Wonderland Postage-Stamp Case" in 1889. This was a cloth-backed folder with twelve slots, two marked for inserting the most commonly used penny stamp, and one each for the other current denominations up to one shilling. The folder was then put into a slipcase decorated with a picture of Alice on the front and the [[Cheshire Cat]] on the back.  It intended to organise stamps wherever one stored their writing implements; Carroll expressly notes in ''[[Eight or Nine Wise Words about Letter-Writing]]'' it is not intended to be carried in a pocket or purse, as the most common individual stamps could easily be carried on their own.  The pack included a copy of a pamphlet version of this lecture.<ref>Flodden W. Heron, "Lewis Carroll, Inventor of Postage Stamp Case" in ''Stamps'', vol. 26, no. 12, 25 March 1939</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk/pages/eventspeopleplaces/inspired/stamps.html |title=Carroll Related Stamps |publisher=The Lewis Carroll Society |date=28 April 2005 |access-date=10 March 2011 |archive-date=21 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321063623/http://lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk/pages/eventspeopleplaces/inspired/stamps.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Nyctograph reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed nyctograph, with scale demonstrated by a 5 [[euro]] cent]]
Another invention was a writing tablet called the [[nyctograph]] that allowed note-taking in the dark, thus eliminating the need to get out of bed and strike a light when one woke with an idea. The device consisted of a gridded card with sixteen squares and a system of symbols representing an alphabet of Dodgson's design, using letter shapes similar to the [[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]] writing system on a [[Palm (PDA)|Palm]] device.<ref>[[Michael Everson|Everson, Michael]].

He also devised a number of games, including an early version of what today is known as [[Scrabble]]. Devised sometime in 1878, he invented the "doublet" (see [[word ladder]]), a form of brain-teaser that is still popular today, changing one word into another by altering one letter at a time, each successive change always resulting in a genuine word.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gardner |first1=Martin |title=Word Ladders: Lewis Carroll's Doublets |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3620349 |access-date=22 March 2022 |volume=80|issue=487, Centenary Issue (Mar. 1996) |publisher=The Mathematical Gazette |jstor=3620349 |archive-date=20 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420093226/https://www.jstor.org/stable/3620349 |url-status=live }}</ref> For instance, CAT is transformed into DOG by the following steps: CAT, COT, DOT, DOG.<ref name = "snaogq"/> It first appeared in the 29 March 1879 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', with Carroll writing a weekly column for the magazine for two years; the final column dated 9 April 1881.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Edge of the Universe: Celebrating Ten Years of Math Horizons|author=Deanna Haunsperger, Stephen Kennedy|publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|page=22|date=31 July 2006|isbn=0-88385-555-0}}</ref> The games and puzzles of Lewis Carroll were the subject of Martin Gardner's March 1960 [[Mathematical Games column]] in ''[[Scientific American]]''.

Other items include a rule for finding the day of the week for any date; a means for justifying right margins on a typewriter; a steering device for a velociman (a type of tricycle); fairer elimination rules for tennis tournaments; a new sort of postal money order; rules for reckoning postage; rules for a win in betting; rules for dividing a number by various divisors; a cardboard scale for the [[Senior Common Room]] at Christ Church which, held next to a glass, ensured the right amount of liqueur for the price paid; a double-sided adhesive strip to fasten envelopes or mount things in books; a device for helping a bedridden invalid to read from a book placed sideways; and at least two [[cipher]]s for [[cryptography]].<ref name = "snaogq"/>

He also proposed alternative systems of parliamentary representation. He proposed the so-called [[Dodgson's method]], using the [[Condorcet method]].<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PN1dAAAACAAJ|title= A Mathematical Approach to Proportional Representation|last1= Black|first1= Duncan|last2= McLean|first2= Iain|last3= McMillan|first3= Alistair|last4= Monroe|first4= Burt L.|last5= Dodgson|first5= Charles Lutwidge|isbn= 978-0-7923-9620-8|year= 1996|publisher= Springer|access-date= 4 October 2020|archive-date= 4 February 2021|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210204020358/https://books.google.com/books?id=PN1dAAAACAAJ|url-status= live}}</ref> In 1884, he proposed a proportional representation system based on multi-member districts, each voter casting only a single vote, quotas as minimum requirements to take seats, and votes transferable by candidates through what is now called [[Liquid democracy]].<ref>Charles Dodgson, Principles of Parliamentary Representation (1884)</ref>

Within the academic discipline of mathematics, Dodgson worked primarily in the fields of [[geometry]], linear and [[matrix algebra]], [[mathematical logic]], and [[recreational mathematics]], producing nearly a dozen books under his real name. Dodgson also developed new ideas in linear algebra (e.g., the first printed proof of the [[Rouché–Capelli theorem]]),<ref>{{cite journal|author=Seneta, Eugene|year=1984|title=Lewis Carroll as a Probabilist and Mathematician|url=http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/eseneta/l.carroll.1984.pdf|journal=The Mathematical Scientist|volume=9|pages=79–84|access-date=1 February 2015|archive-date=30 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130175208/http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/eseneta/l.carroll.1984.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Abeles, Francine F.

=== Mathematical logic ===

His work in the field of mathematical logic attracted renewed interest in the late 20th century. Martin Gardner's book on logic machines and diagrams and William Warren Bartley's posthumous publication of the second part of Dodgson's symbolic logic book have sparked a reevaluation of Dodgson's contributions to symbolic logic.<ref>Gardner, Martin.

Dodgson wrote and received as many as 98,721 letters, according to a special letter register which he devised.

== Later life ==

[[File:Through the looking-glass, and what Alice found there (1917) (14773105753).jpg|thumb|upright|Lewis Carroll in later life]]

Dodgson's existence remained little changed over the last twenty years of his life, despite his growing wealth and fame. He continued to teach at Christ Church until 1881 and remained in residence there until his death. Public appearances included attending the [[West End theatre|West End]] musical ''[[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (the first major live production of his ''Alice'' books) at the  [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] on 30 December 1886.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carroll |first1=Lewis |title=The Letters of Lewis Carroll, Volumes 1–2|page=657 |date=1979|publisher=Oxford University Press|quote=Dec. 30th.—To London with M—, and took her to "[[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|Alice in Wonderland]]," Mr. Savile Clarke's play at the Prince of Wales's Theatre... as a whole, the play seems a success.}}</ref> The two volumes of his last novel, ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'', were published in 1889 and 1893, but the intricacy of this work was apparently not appreciated by contemporary readers; it achieved nothing like the success of the ''Alice'' books, with disappointing reviews and sales of only 13,000 copies.<ref>Angelica Shirley Carpenter (2002).

The only known occasion on which he travelled abroad was a trip to Russia in 1867 as an ecclesiastic, together with the Reverend [[Henry Liddon]]. He recounts the travel in his "Russian Journal", which was first commercially published in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewiscarroll.org/works.html |title=Chronology of Works of Lewis Carroll |access-date=20 February 2009 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220131026/http://www.lewiscarroll.org/works.html |archive-date=20 February 2009 }}</ref> On his way to Russia and back, he also saw different cities in Belgium, Germany, partitioned Poland and Lithuania, and France.

In his early sixties, Dodgson increasingly suffered from [[synovitis]] which eventually prevented him walking and sometimes left him bed-ridden for months.<ref>''The Colour Library Book of Great British Writers'' (1993), p.197, Colour Library Books Ltd, (Godalming, England) {{ISBN|978-0-86283-678-8}}</ref>

== Controversies and mysteries ==

=== ''The Secret World of Lewis Carroll'' (2015) BBC documentary ===
A BBC documentary from 2015, ''The Secret World of Lewis Carroll'',<ref name=":4">{{Citation |title=The Secret World of Lewis Carroll [HD, 1280x720].m | date=11 April 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et66bSEUyug |access-date=10 February 2024 |language=en}}</ref> critically examined Dodgson's relationship with Alice Liddell and her sisters. It explored the possibility that Dodgson's rift with the Liddell family (and his temporary suspension from the college) might have been caused by improper relations with their children, including Alice. The research for the documentary found a "disturbing" full frontal nude of Alice's adolescent sister Lorina during filming,<ref name=":1">{{Citation |title=BBC The Secret World of Lewis Carroll | date=17 May 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KQ9kDbduTo |access-date=14 January 2024 |language=en}}</ref> and speculated on the "likelihood" of Dodgson taking the photo. However, it was later revealed the timeline for this research had more than met the eye. The photo currently exists in the archives of the [[Musée Cantini]] in [[Marseille]], and was attributed to Dodgson by a currently unknown hand.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marseille |first=la collection du musée Cantini |date=15 January 2024 |title=la collection du musée Cantini, Marseille |url=https://www.navigart.fr/cantini/artwork/lewis-carroll-attribue-a-sans-titre-530000000000248?page=1&filters=query:lewis%20carroll |access-date=10 February 2024 |website=Navigart.fr |language=fr}}</ref> It was subsequently revealed in early 2015 by the Carroll scholar Edward Wakeling that the photo first appeared in the 1970s, when it was owned by Parisian photo collectors. The provenance of the photo's link to Dodgson could be questioned. It was left to the Musée de Cantini. There was no link to Dodgson, and no link to the Liddell family.<ref name=":3" /> This was not explained in the documentary. The documentary raised suspicions about Dodgson being a "repressed paedophile",<ref name=":4"/> as one of the interviewees, [[Will Self]], put it. This aspect was leaked to ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' a week in advance.<ref>{{Cite web |date=26 January 2015 |title=BBC investigates whether Lewis Carroll was 'repressed paedophile' after nude photo discovery |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/11368772/BBC-investigates-whether-Lewis-Carroll-was-repressed-paedophile-after-nude-photo-discovery.html |access-date=10 February 2024 |website=The Telegraph |language=en}}</ref> When reviewing the documentary, papers sought to link the 19th-century Carroll with 21st-century sexual conduct revelations about recent paedophiles.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Curiouser and Curiouser: The Case of Lewis Carroll {{!}} History Today |url=https://www.historytoday.com/curiouser-and-curiouser-case-lewis-carroll |access-date=10 February 2024 |website=www.historytoday.com}}</ref> This attempted link could be considered an act of scapegoating inspired by the media's reactions to the UK's early 2010 [[Operation Yewtree|Yewtree]] investigations. When problems about the documentary's conduct and research surfaced, ''[[The Times]]'' and ''The Telegraph'' reported it.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" />

The material in the documentary has come under intense scrutiny by Carroll scholars, including those such as Jenny Woolf and Edward Wakeling, who appeared in it. Woolf claimed that she was not told of the use of the alleged photo until editing of the documentary was underway.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=From Somewhere in Time » THE SECRET WORLD OF LEWIS CARROLL |url=https://www.jabberwock.co.uk/blog/index.php?itemid=1364 |access-date=10 February 2024 |website=www.jabberwock.co.uk}}</ref> Edward Wakeling's paper/review "Eight or nine wise words on documentary making" [https://archive.org/details/the-secret-world-of-lewis-carroll-context] appeared in March 2015 as part of the Lewis Carroll society newsletter ''Bandersnatch''. Wakeling also echoed Woolf's assertions that he was not given time to talk about the alleged photo. Wakeling claimed, "The documentary knew I could authenticate [the photo] or not, but they chose to keep it from me as they anticipated my response." Wakeling further criticises in his paper the Cantini photo's authenticity, the BBC's failure to tell participants of the found photo, and several factual errors.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last=Wakeling |first=Edward |editor-last=Fulcher |editor-first=Lindsay |title=Eight or nine wise words about documentary-making.... |journal=Bandersnatch: The Newsletter of the Lewis Carroll Society |publisher=Lewis Carroll Society UK |publication-place=London |issue=166 |pages=16–20}}</ref> Wakeling draws attention to the irregular "trimmed" nature of the photo itself, and no trace of Dodgson's writing. The inscription on the back of the photo, attributed "lewis Carroll" in pencil, "is an unknown hand... so it could have been written by anybody"''.'' The photo negative is also missing the personal catalogue number that Dodgson meticulously catalogued his photos under. "[Dodgson's] usual practice was to add a number on the back of any prints which he had developed". Wakeling also points out that Dodgson never made "full frontal studies...particularly a girl as mature as this.. There's no way the Liddells would have allowed a picture of this kind to have been taken."''<ref name=":3" />'' It is currently unknown whether this photo is by Dodgson, nor who wrote the pencil inscription on the back of it and for what reason. The photo was not included in Wakeling's catalogue raisonné of Dodgson's complete surviving photographs ''<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wakeling |first=Edward |title=The photographs of Lewis Carroll: a catalogue raisonné |date=August 2015 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-76743-0}}</ref>'' and has remained unused by other subsequent documentaries on Dodgson.''<ref>{{Citation |title=Who REALLY was Lewis Carroll?

=== Speculation of sexual conduct by scholars (1940s onwards) ===
Late twentieth-century biographers have speculated that Dodgson's interest in children might have had an "erotic" element, including [[Morton N. Cohen]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography'' (1995),<ref name="cohen-166254">[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 166–167, 254–255</ref> {{citation needed span|date=October 2024|[[Donald Serrell Thomas|Donald Thomas]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Portrait with Background'' (1995), and [[Michael Bakewell]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography'' (1996).}}
Cohen, in particular, speculates that Dodgson's "sexual energies sought unconventional outlets", and further writes:

{{blockquote|We cannot know to what extent sexual urges lay behind Charles's preference for drawing and photographing children in the nude. He contended the preference was entirely aesthetic. But given his emotional attachment to children as well as his aesthetic appreciation of their forms, his assertion that his interest was strictly artistic is naïve. He probably felt more than he dared acknowledge, even to himself.<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;228</ref>}}

[[File: Hatch, Beatrice (Lewis Carroll, 30.07.1873).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Lewis Carroll photograph of [[Beatrice Hatch]], colourised on Carroll's instructions]]
Cohen goes on to note that Dodgson "apparently convinced many of his friends that his attachment to the nude female child form was free of any [[erotic]]ism", but adds that "later generations look beneath the surface" (p.&nbsp;229). He argues that Dodgson may have wanted to marry the 11-year-old Alice Liddell and that this was the cause of the unexplained "break" with the family in June 1863,<ref name="snaogq"/> {{citation needed span|date=September 2021|an event for which other explanations are offered. Biographers Derek Hudson and [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] stop short of identifying Dodgson as a [[paedophile]] (Green also edited Dodgson's diaries and papers), but they concur that he had a passion for small female children and next to no interest in the adult world.}} Catherine Robson refers to Carroll as "the Victorian era's most famous (or infamous) girl lover".<ref>{{cite book|first=Catherine|last=Robson|title=Men in Wonderland: The Lost Girlhood of the Victorian Gentlemen|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, New Jersey|date=2001|isbn=978-0691004228|page=137}}</ref> Media studies scholar [[Will Brooker]] points out that perception of Dodgson this way in the 20th century was heavily influenced by [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] theories. Brooker considers Dodgson's alleged perversion as a product of its time that outstayed its welcome culturally: <blockquote>The psychoanalytic [Freudian] interpretations of the Alice books in the 1930s were a product of a specific moment and movement... The discourses that I traced in journalism and in some biographies, that Carroll was emotionally arrested, a repressed paedophile, an obsessive, stammering social reject... -- have more to do with our own attitudes to childhood and celebrity than they do to the culture Carroll lived through.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-01-26 |title=Down the rabbit-hole and out again: How Alice helped shape our literary world. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2004/04/04/down-the-rabbit-hole-and-out-again-how-alice-helped-shape-our-literary-world/6a198792-8f79-42b1-982c-b71eee611097/ |access-date=2024-09-16 |work=Washington Post |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Brooker |first=Will |title=Alice's adventures: Lewis Carroll in popular culture |date=2004 |publisher=Continuum |isbn=978-0-8264-1433-5 |location=New York}}</ref></blockquote>[[File:"Nymph of the Forest" Photograph (1901).png|thumb|Photograph showing a nude child from ''[[The Australasian]]'', 1901.

[[Hugues Lebailly]] has endeavoured to set Dodgson's child photography within the "Victorian Child Cult", which perceived child nudity as essentially an expression of innocence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://contrariwise.wild-reality.net/association.html |title=Association for new Lewis Carroll studies |publisher=Contrariwise.wild-reality.net |access-date=19 October 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207054041/http://www.contrariwise.wild-reality.net/association.html |archive-date=7 February 2012 }}</ref> He claims that Dodgson's diaries contained numerous entries that reveal an appreciation for adult women, as well as their appearance in art and theatre, even "vulgar" entertainment. Dodgson's nieces removed such references from early manuscripts of Dodgson's diaries, but kept references to children, because such appreciation was not controversial at the time. {{citation needed span|date=October 2024|Lebailly claims that studies of child nudes were mainstream and fashionable in Dodgson's time and that most photographers made them as a matter of course, including [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]] and [[Julia Margaret Cameron]]. Lebailly continues that child nudes even appeared on Victorian [[Christmas card]]s, implying a very different social and aesthetic assessment of such material. Lebailly concludes that it has been an error of Dodgson's biographers to view his child-photography with 20th- or 21st-century eyes, and to have presented it as some form of personal idiosyncrasy, when it was a response to a prevalent aesthetic and philosophical movement of the time.}}

[[Karoline Leach]]'s reappraisal of Dodgson focused in particular on his controversial interest in nude children. She argues that the allegations of paedophilia rose initially from a misunderstanding of Victorian morals, as well as the mistaken idea – fostered by Dodgson's various biographers – that he had no interest in adult women. She termed the traditional image of Dodgson "the Carroll Myth". She drew attention to the large amounts of evidence in his diaries and letters that he was also keenly interested in adult women, married and single, and enjoyed several relationships with them that would have been considered scandalous by the social standards of his time. She also pointed to the fact that many of those whom he described as "child-friends" were girls in their late teens and even twenties.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 16–17</ref> She argues that suggestions of paedophilia emerged only many years after his death, when his well-meaning family had suppressed all evidence of his relationships with women in an effort to preserve his reputation, thus giving a false impression of a man interested only in little girls. Similarly, Leach points to a 1932 biography by Langford Reed as the source of the dubious claim that many of Carroll's female friendships ended when the girls reached the age of 14.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;33</ref>

=== Ordination ===

Dodgson had been groomed for the ordained ministry in the [[Church of England]] from a very early age, and was expected to be [[holy orders|ordained]] within four years of obtaining his master's degree as a condition of his residency at Christ Church. He delayed the process for some time but was eventually ordained as a deacon on 22 December 1861, but when the time came a year later to be ordained as a priest, Dodgson appealed to the dean for permission not to proceed. This was against college rules and, initially, Dean Liddell told him that he would have to consult the college ruling body, which would almost certainly have resulted in his being expelled. For unknown reasons, Liddell changed his mind overnight and permitted him to remain at the college in defiance of the rules.<ref>Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, 22–24 October 1862</ref> Dodgson never became a priest, unique among senior students of his time.

There is currently no conclusive evidence about why Dodgson rejected the priesthood. Some have suggested that his stammer made him reluctant to take the step because he was afraid of having to preach.<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;263</ref> Wilson quotes letters by Dodgson describing difficulty in reading lessons and prayers rather than preaching in his own words.<ref>[[#Wilson|Wilson]], pp. 103–104</ref> However Dodgson did indeed preach in later life, even though not in priest's orders, so it seems unlikely that his impediment was a major factor affecting his choice. Wilson also points out that the [[Bishop of Oxford]], [[Samuel Wilberforce]], who ordained Dodgson, had strong views against clergy going to the theatre, one of Dodgson's great interests. He was interested in minority forms of Christianity (he was an admirer of [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F. D. Maurice]]) and "alternative" religions ([[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]).<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;134</ref> Dodgson became deeply troubled by an unexplained sense of sin and guilt at this time (the early 1860s), and frequently expressed the view in his diaries that he was a "vile and worthless" sinner, unworthy of the priesthood, and this sense of sin and unworthiness may well have informed his decision to abandon being ordained to the priesthood.<ref>Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, see prayers scattered throughout the text</ref>

=== Missing diaries ===
At least four complete volumes and around seven pages of text are missing from Dodgson's 13 diaries.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 48, 51</ref> The loss of the volumes remains unexplained; the pages have been removed by an unknown hand. Most scholars assume that the diary material was removed by family members in the interests of preserving the family name, but this has not been proven.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 48–51</ref> Except for one page, material is missing from his diaries for the period between 1853 and 1863 (when Dodgson was 21–31 years old).<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;52</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Real Lewis Carroll – A Talk given to the Lewis Carroll Society|first=Edward|last=Wakeling|date=April 2003|url=http://www.wakeling.demon.co.uk/page3-real-lewiscarroll.htm|access-date=12 January 2023|archive-date=8 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708035011/http://www.wakeling.demon.co.uk/page3-real-lewiscarroll.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> During this period, Dodgson began experiencing great mental and spiritual anguish and confessing to an overwhelming sense of his own sin.

Many theories have been put forward to explain the missing material. A popular explanation for one missing page (27 June 1863) is that it might have been torn out to conceal a proposal of marriage on that day by Dodgson to the 11-year-old Alice Liddell. However, there has never been any evidence to suggest this, and a paper suggests evidence to the contrary which was discovered by [[Karoline Leach]] in the Dodgson family archive in 1996.<ref name="Cut Pages">{{cite web|title=The cut pages in diary document|url=http://carroll-myth.wild-reality.net/cutpages.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230112165538/http://carroll-myth.wild-reality.net/cutpages.html|archive-date=12 January 2023|access-date=12 January 2023}}</ref>{{Better source needed|reason=Website appears to be maintained by a single person with the sole agenda of promoting this idea.|date=July 2023}}

[[File:Cutpagesdoc.jpg|thumb|upright|The "cut pages in diary" document, in the Dodgson family archive in Woking]]
This paper is known as the "cut pages in diary" document. Carroll's nephew Philip Dodgson Jacques reports that he wrote it well after Carroll's death, based on information from his aunts, who destroyed two diary pages, including the one for 27 June 1863. Jacques did not see the pages himself.<ref>Cohen, Morton N. "When love was young", Times Literary Supplement, 10 September 2004.</ref> The summary for 27 June states that Mrs. Liddell told Dodgson there was gossip circulating about him and the Liddell family's [[governess]], as well as about his relationship with "Ina", presumably Alice's older sister Lorina Liddell. The "break" with the Liddell family that occurred soon after was presumably in response to this gossip.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 170–2.</ref><ref name="Cut Pages" /> Without evidence, Leach suggests an alternative interpretation; Lorina was also the name of Alice Liddell's mother. What is deemed most crucial and surprising is the document seems to imply that Dodgson's break with the family was not connected with Alice at all. Until a primary source is discovered, the events of 27 June 1863 will remain in doubt; however, a 1930 letter from the younger Lorina Liddell to Alice may shed light on the matter. Reporting an interview with an early Dodgson biographer, she wrote:

{{blockquote |I said his manner became too affectionate to you as you grew older, and that mother spoke to him about it, and that offended him so he ceased coming to visit us again – as one had to find some reason for all intercourse ceasing . . . Mr. D used to take you on his knee . . . I did <u>not</u> say that.<ref>Cohen, "When love was young"</ref>}}

=== Migraine and epilepsy ===

In his diary from 1880, Dodgson recorded experiencing his first episode of [[migraine]] with [[Aura (symptom)|aura]], describing very accurately the process of "moving fortifications" that are a manifestation of the aura stage of the syndrome.<ref name=w1>Wakeling, Edward (Ed.) "The Diaries of Lewis Carroll", Vol. 9, p.&nbsp;52</ref> There is no clear evidence to show whether this was his first experience of migraine ''per se'' or he previously had the far more common form of migraine without aura, although the latter seems most likely, given the fact that migraine most commonly develops in the teens or early adulthood. Another form of migraine aura called [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]] has been named after Dodgson's book of the same name and its titular character, because its manifestation can resemble the sudden size-changes in the book. It is also known as [[micropsia]] and [[macropsia]], a brain condition affecting the way that objects are perceived by the mind. For example, an affected person may look at a larger object such as a basketball and perceive it as having the size of a golf ball. Some authors have suggested that Dodgson experienced this type of aura and used it as an inspiration in his work, but there is no evidence that he did.<ref name="Migraineand">{{cite journal|title=Migraine and Lewis Carroll|author= Maudie, F.W. |journal=The Migraine Periodical|volume=17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

Dodgson also had two attacks in which he lost consciousness. He was diagnosed by a Dr Morshead, Dr Brooks, and Dr Stedman, and they believed the attack and a consequent attack to be an "epileptiform" seizure (initially thought to be fainting, but Brooks changed his mind). Some have concluded from this that he had this condition for his entire life, but there is no evidence of this in his diaries beyond the diagnosis of the two attacks already mentioned.<ref name=w1/> Some authors, Sadi Ranson in particular, have suggested that Carroll had [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] in which consciousness is not always completely lost but altered, and in which the symptoms mimic many of the same experiences as Alice in Wonderland. Carroll had at least one incident in which he suffered full loss of consciousness and awoke with a bloody nose, which he recorded in his diary and noted that the episode left him not feeling himself for "quite sometime afterward". This attack was diagnosed as possibly "epileptiform", and Carroll himself later wrote of his "seizures" in the same diary.

Most of the standard diagnostic tests of today were not available in the nineteenth century. Yvonne Hart, consultant neurologist at the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], Oxford, considered Dodgson's symptoms. Her conclusion, quoted in Jenny Woolf's 2010 ''The Mystery of Lewis Carroll'', is that Dodgson very likely had migraine and may have had epilepsy, but she emphasises that she would have considerable doubt about making a diagnosis of epilepsy without further information.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Woolf |first=Jenny |title=The Mystery of Lewis Carroll |pages=298–9 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=978-0-312-67371-0|date=4 February 2010}}</ref>
