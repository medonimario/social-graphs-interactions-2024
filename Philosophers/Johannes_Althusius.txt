'''Johannes Althusius''' (1563 – August 12, 1638)<ref name = JohanEB>{{Citation | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | contribution-url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9005931/Johannes-Althusius | contribution = Johannes Althusius}}.</ref> was a German–French jurist and [[Calvinist]] [[political philosopher]].

He is best known for his 1603 work ''"Politica Methodice Digesta, Atque Exemplis Sacris et Profanis Illustrata"''{{Efn |Latin for "Politics Methodically Digested, Illustrated with Sacred and Profane Examples".}} which revised editions were published in 1610 and 1614.  The ideas expressed therein relate to the early development of [[federalism]] in the 16th and 17th centuries and the construction of [[subsidiarity]].

==Biography==
Johannes Althusius was born in 1563 to a family of modest means in [[Diedenshausen]], County Sayn-Wittgenstein ([[Siegen-Wittgenstein]]),<ref name=JohanEB/> a Calvinist County in what is now the state of [[North Rhine Westphalia]] (but was then the seat of an independent ''Grafschaft'' or County).  Under the patronage of a local count, he attended the Gymnasium Philippinum in [[Marburg]] from 1577 and began his studies in 1581, concentrating in law and philosophy.  He first studied [[Aristotle]] in [[Cologne]], then studied law around 1585/86 under [[Denis Godefroy]] at [[Basel]].<ref name="On Law and Power">Johannes Althusius, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-and-power On Law and Power] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814162210/http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-and-power |date=2016-08-14 }}''. CLP Academic, 2013, p.xx.</ref>  In 1586, Althusius received his doctorate in civil and [[canon law]] from the [[University of Basel]]. While studying at Basel, Althusius lived with [[Johann Jakob Grynaeus|Johannes Grynaeus]] for a period of time, with whom he studied theology.<ref name="On Law and Power"/>

After completing his studies in 1586, Althusius became the first professor of law at the Protestant-Calvinist [[Herborn Academy]] of Nassau County.<ref name="On Law and Power"/> From 1592 to 1596, he taught at the Calvinist Academy in Burgsteinfurt/Westphalia.<ref name = JohanEB/>
He was married in 1596 in Siegen to Margarethe Neurath (born 1574), with whom he had at least six children.{{citation needed||date=November 2022}} In 1599 he was appointed president of the Nassau College in its temporary location in [[Siegen]], returning with it to Herborn in 1602.<ref name = JohanEB/> At the same time he began his political career by serving as a member of the [[Nassau, Germany|Nassau]] (Germany) county council.

For the next several years Althusius was involved in several colleges in the area, variously serving as their president and lecturing on law and philosophy. In 1603 he was elected as a municipal trustee of the city of [[Emden]], in [[East Frisia]], where he ultimately made his fame. He became a city [[Syndic]] in 1604, which placed him at the helm of Emden's governance until his death.

In 1617 Althusius published his principal judicial work, ''Dicaeologicae''.  In this work, he categorized laws into two main types: natural laws and positive laws, and argued that natural law is "the will of God for men."<ref>Johannes Althusius, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-and-power On Law and Power] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814162210/http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-and-power |date=2016-08-14 }}''. CLP Academic, 2013, pp.lvi.</ref> Althusius contended that terms such as "common law" and "moral law" were other names for natural law.  To know the true dictates of natural law, he argued, we must carefully study Scripture and tradition, as well as revelation and reason.<ref>Johannes Althusius, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-and-power On Law and Power] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814162210/http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-and-power |date=2016-08-14 }}''. CLP Academic, 2013, p.lviii.</ref>

Johannes Althusius died on August 12, 1638, in Emden.<ref name=JohanEB />

===Political legacy===
After his death Althusius remained a controversial thinker.  His ''Politica'' was attacked by [[Henning Arnisaeus]] and [[Hugo Grotius]] during the 17th century for its defense of [[autonomy|local autonomies]] against the rise of territorial absolutism and proponents of the modern united [[nation state]].<ref>Johannes Althusius, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-and-power On Law and Power] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814162210/http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-and-power |date=2016-08-14 }}''. CLP Academic, 2013, p.xxiii.</ref> Interest in Althusius' theories continued into the second half of the 17th century, but Althusius was forgotten once the [[European wars of religion]] had ended.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Protestantism |author1=  Hans J. Hillerbrand |publisher=   Taylor & Francis| year=2004| isbn=9781135960285| page=52}}</ref> 

Althusius had published in the [[Latin language]] using fashionable [[Ramist]] logic. As time passed, his political canon was read less and the barriers to interpreting Althusian politics increased.<ref>{{Cite book|title=System, Order, and International Law |author1=  David Roth-Isigkeit |author2=  Stefan Kadelbach |author3=  Thomas Kleinlein |publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2017| isbn=9780198768586| page=130}}</ref> In the second half of the 19th century Althusius was rediscovered when [[Otto von Gierke]] published research on ''Politica''. In Germany, an academic society was founded to research Althusius and his times.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Protestantism |author1=  Hans J. Hillerbrand |publisher=Taylor & Francis| year=2004| isbn=9781135960285| page=52}}</ref> At a time when [[Otto von Bismarck]] worked towards [[unification of Germany|unifying Germany]] Gierke promoted Althusius' preoccupation with political order based on [[Plurality (voting)|majority decisions]], traditional European relationships, and negotiated agreements as a timely theory on procedural federalism. In 1871 most [[Kleinstaaterei|German states]] unified to form the [[German Empire]] under [[Constitution of the German Empire|Bismarck's imperial constitution]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=System, Order, and International Law |author1=  David Roth-Isigkeit |author2=  Stefan Kadelbach |author3=  Thomas Kleinlein |publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2017| isbn=9780198768586| page=130}}</ref> Gierke's book on Althusian federalism went on to become a source of inspiration for [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] in Britain, with [[John Neville Figgis]] and [[Harold Laski]] adapting Gierke.<ref>{{Cite book|title=System, Order, and International Law |author1=  David Roth-Isigkeit |author2=  Stefan Kadelbach |author3=  Thomas Kleinlein |publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2017| isbn=9780198768586| page=131}}</ref>
  
In 1932 the German–American professor [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] published a new, slightly abridged edition of Althusius' ''Politica''. After [[World War II]] Friedrich helped to draft the German constitution, known as [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], while working as adviser in [[Allied-occupied Germany]]. Friedrich praised Althusius for having written the first "full-bodied concept of federalism" and so generated renewed interest in Althusius on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1964 Frederick Smith Carney published an abridged English translation of ''Politica'', exposing Althusius to a wider readership. In 1968 Althusisus was credited as "the real father of modern federalism" by [[Daniel J. Elazar]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=System, Order, and International Law |author1=  David Roth-Isigkeit |author2=  Stefan Kadelbach |author3=  Thomas Kleinlein |publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2017| isbn=9780198768586| page=131}}</ref>

==Althusian federalism==
Johannes Althusius saw [[confederation]]s as feasible and successful cooperative constitutional orders. In his view, a confederation could be built on successive levels of political community where each community pursues common interests. A village was a union of families, a town was a union of [[guild]]s, a province was a union of towns, a state was a union of provinces, and an empire was a union of [[State (polity)|state]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hechter|first=Michael|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/470549985|title=Containing nationalism|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-924751-X|pages=42|oclc=470549985}}</ref> Althusius' understanding of society as a community of communities informed his views on the nature of politics and [[federalism]] (''consociatio symbiotica''). For Althusius the purpose of politics was the "science of those matters which pertain to the living together" and federations perfectly put the purpose of politics into practice. Althusius's federalism did not involve the surrendering of [[Power (social and political)|power]], instead it rested on responsibly sharing power.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cultural Policy and Federalism |author= Jonathan Paquette |publisher= Springer International Publishing |year=2019|isbn=9783030126803|page=11}}</ref> 

Althusius became one of the principal European thinkers on federalism at the start of the 17th century while the [[European continent]] was ravaged by [[European wars of religion|religious war]]s. Against the backdrop of the [[Reformation]] and the rise of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist monarchies]], Althusius identified the German [[Holy Roman Empire]] as a [[commonwealth]] were the majority could decide matters for all.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Research Agenda for Federalism Studies |author=  John Kincaid |publisher=  Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2019|isbn=9781788112970|page=17}}</ref> In reference to [[Aristotle]], Althusius examined the confederate institutions of the Holy Roman Empire and established a theory of federalism where power is shared among [[autonomous]] smaller and larger political communities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Research Agenda for Federalism Studies |author=  John Kincaid |publisher=  Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2019|isbn=9781788112970|page=19}}</ref> Althusius was [[Calvinist]] and did not hold [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s theory on the commonwealth in high regard. In 1603 Althusius published ''Politica Methodice Digesta'', setting out his theory on building a federal political system out of political associations that were grounded in the free initiative of citizens.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook on the Economics of Reciprocity and Social Enterprise |author1= Luigino Bruni| author2= Stefano Zamagni |publisher=  Edward Elgar| year=2013| isbn=9781849804745|page=356}}</ref>

Althusius relied on the [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonian]] idea of a universal brotherhood, thus he combined the Greco-Roman ideal of an association that was governed by reciprocal relationships with the Catholic Christian principled of [[subsidiarity]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook on the Economics of Reciprocity and Social Enterprise |author1= Luigino Bruni| author2= Stefano Zamagni |publisher=  Edward Elgar| year=2013| isbn=9781849804745|page=159}}</ref> Althusius' teachings presented an alternative to the theories of his contemporary [[Jean Bodin]] on [[sovereignty]]. According to Althusus, [[natural law]] gave citizens the right to resist tyrannical government and sovereignty rested with the community, not the ruler. Therefore Althusius maintained that legitimate political authority was founded on smaller communities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Protestantism |author1=  Hans J. Hillerbrand |publisher=   Taylor & Francis| year=2004| isbn=9781135960285| page=52}}</ref>
