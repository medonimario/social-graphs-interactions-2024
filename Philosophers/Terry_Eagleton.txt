==Early life==
Eagleton was born in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Lancashire]], England, on 22 February 1943,<ref name=autogenerated2>{{Cite web |url=http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/e/25737/Terry+EAGLETON.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724030211/http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/e/25737/Terry+EAGLETON.aspx |url-status=dead |title=Prof Terry Eagleton profile, ''Debrett's People of Today'', FBA Profile |archivedate=24 July 2013}}</ref> to Francis Paul Eagleton and his wife, Rosaleen (née Riley) Eagleton.<ref>"EAGLETON, Prof. Terence Francis" at [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U14520, ''Who's Who 2012'', A & C Black, 2012; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2011; online edn November 2011; accessed 23 September 2012].</ref> He grew up in a working-class Catholic family of Irish descent in [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]], with roots in [[County Galway]]. His mother's side of the family had strong [[Irish Republicanism|Irish republican]] sympathies. He served as an [[altar boy]] at a local [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] convent where he was responsible for escorting novice nuns taking their vows, a role referred to in the title of his memoir ''The Gatekeeper'' (2002).<ref>{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Kernan |date=18 December 2008 |title=Terry Eagleton – taking on the capitalists and atheists in Galway |url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/6353 |work=Galway Advertiser}}</ref>

==Education and academia==
Eagleton was educated at [[Pendleton College|De La Salle College]], a Roman Catholic grammar school in [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]].<ref name="Smith2013" /> In 1961, he went to read English at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], whence he graduated with first-class honours.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> He later described his undergraduate experience as a "waste of time".<ref name="Smith2013" /> In 1964, he moved to [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], where as a junior research fellow and doctoral student, he became the youngest fellow at the college since the 18th century.<ref name=autogenerated1/> He was supervised by [[Raymond Williams]].<ref name=autogenerated3 /> It was during this period that his socialist convictions began to take hold, and he edited a radical Catholic leftist periodical called ''[[Slant (journal)|Slant]]''.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

In 1969, he moved to the [[University of Oxford]] where he became a fellow and tutor of [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College]] (1969–1989), [[Linacre College, Oxford|Linacre College]] (1989–1993) and [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's College]], becoming Thomas Warton Professor of English in 1992. At Wadham, Eagleton ran a well-known seminar on Marxist literary theory which, in the 1980s, metamorphosed into the radical pressure group [[Oxford English Limited]] and its journal ''[[News from Nowhere: Journal of the Oxford English Faculty Opposition]]'', to which he contributed several pieces.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}} In 2001, Eagleton left Oxford to become the [[John Edward Taylor]] Professor of English at the [[University of Manchester]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Smith |first1=James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9uKXR45GhkcC |title=Terry Eagleton |last2=Smith |first2=James Benjamin |date=2008-07-08 |publisher=Polity |isbn=978-0-7456-3609-2 |pages=8 |language=en |quote="The final break with Oxbridge came in 2001, with a move to the University of Manchester as the John Edward Taylor Professor of English Literature, with Eagleton now dividing time between living in England and Ireland."}}</ref>

==Career==
Eagleton began his literary studies with the 19th and 20th centuries, then conformed to the stringent academic Marxism of the 1970s. He then published an attack on his mentor Williams's relation to the Marxist tradition in the pages of the ''[[New Left Review]]'', in the mode of the French critic [[Louis Althusser]]. In the 1960s, he became involved with the left-wing Catholic group ''[[Slant (journal)|Slant]]'', authoring a number of theological articles (including ''A Marxist Interpretation of [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament|Benediction]]''), as well as a book ''Towards a New Left Theology''. A major turning point was his ''Criticism & Ideology'' (1976) in which Eagleton discusses various theorists and critics from [[F.&nbsp;R. Leavis]] and (his tutor) Raymond Williams to [[Pierre Macherey]]. This earliest response to Theory is critical and substantive with Eagleton supplying a dense web of categories for "a materialist criticism" which situates the author as well as the text in the general mode of production, the ''literary'' mode of production and particular ideologies. In chapter 4 he gives a thorough overview of one theme in the English context&nbsp;– "organicist concepts of society" or "community"&nbsp;– as worked by petty-bourgeois Victorian writers, from [[George Eliot]] to [[D.&nbsp;H. Lawrence]], and how this determines textual form in each instance.

===''Literary Theory'' and ''After Theory''===
In ''[[Literary Theory: An Introduction]]'' (1983, revised 1996), Eagleton surveys the history of theoretical approaches to literature, from its beginnings with Matthew Arnold, through formalism, psychoanalysis, and structuralism, to post-structuralism. In the process, he demonstrates what is the thesis of the book: that theory is necessarily political. Theory is always presented as if it is unstained by point of view and is neutral, but in fact it is impossible to avoid having a political perspective. Peter Barry has said of the book that it "greatly contributed to the 'consolidation' of literary theory and helped to establish it firmly on the undergraduate curriculum".<ref>Barry, Peter. ''Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory''. Manchester University Press, 2009, p. 273.</ref> Eagleton's approach to literary criticism is one firmly rooted in the Marxist tradition, though he has also incorporated techniques and ideas from more recent modes of thought as [[structuralism]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian analysis]] and [[deconstruction]]. As his memoir ''The Gatekeeper'' recounts, Eagleton's Marxism has never been solely an academic pursuit. He was active in the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|International Socialists]] (along with [[Christopher Hitchens]]) and then the [[Workers' Socialist League]] whilst in Oxford. He has been a regular contributor to the ''[[London Review of Books]]''.<ref>[https://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/terry-eagleton LRB archive]. But only six contributions from 2014 to 2017.</ref>

''After Theory'' (2003) was written two decades later, after the end of the great period of High Theory&nbsp;– the cultural theory of Foucault, the postmodernists, Derrida, et al. Looking back, Eagleton evaluates its achievements and failures, and proposes new directions needing to be pursued. He considers that among the great achievements of Theory were the expansion of objects of study (to include gender, sexuality, popular culture, post-colonialism, etc.), and the wide-ranging self-reflective criticism of traditional assumptions. But in Eagleton's estimation there were also many serious mistakes, for instance: the assault on the normative and the insistence on the relativity of truth leaves us powerless to criticize oppression; the rejection of objectivity and (excessively) of all forms of essentialism bespeak an unrecognized idealism, or at least a blindness to our human materiality, ultimately born of an unconscious fear of death; and cultural studies has wrongly avoided consideration of ethics, which for Eagleton is inextricably tied to a proper politics. It is virtue and politics and how they may be realized, among other things, that Eagleton offers as new avenues needing to be explored by cultural studies. ''After Theory'' fleshes out this political aspect, tied to ethics, growing out of the fact that humans exist in neediness and dependency on others, their freedom bounded by the common fact of death.

===Dawkins, Hitchens and the New Atheism===
Eagleton has become a vocal critic of what has been called the [[New Atheism]]. In October 2006, he published a review of [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''[[The God Delusion]]'' in the ''[[London Review of Books]]''. Eagleton begins by questioning Dawkins's methodology and understanding: "Imagine someone holding forth on biology whose only knowledge of the subject is the ''Book of British Birds'', and you have a rough idea of what it feels like to read Richard Dawkins on theology." Eagleton further writes, "Nor does [Dawkins] understand that because God is [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] of us (which is another way of saying that he did not have to bring us about), he is free of any neurotic need for us and wants simply to be allowed to love us."<ref name="Terry Eagleton">{{Cite journal |title=Lunging, Flailing, Mispunching |last=Eagleton |first=Terry |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n20/terry-eagleton/lunging-flailing-mispunching |volume=28 |issue=20 |date=19 October 2006 |access-date=26 November 2006}}</ref> He concludes by suggesting Dawkins has not been attacking organised faith so much as a sort of rhetorical [[straw man]]:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eagleton |first=Terry |title=Lunging, Flailing, Mispunching |journal=London Review of Books |date=19 October 2006 |volume=28 |issue=20 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n20/terry-eagleton/lunging-flailing-mispunching |access-date=1 September 2013}}</ref>{{Blockquote|Apart from the occasional perfunctory gesture to 'sophisticated' religious believers, Dawkins tends to see religion and fundamentalist religion as one and the same. This is not only grotesquely false; it is also a device to outflank any more reflective kind of faith by implying that it belongs to the coterie and not to the mass. The huge numbers of believers who hold something like the theology I outlined above can thus be conveniently lumped with rednecks who murder abortionists and malign homosexuals.}}

====Terry and Gifford Lectures====
In April 2008 Eagleton delivered [[Yale University]]'s [[Terry Lectures]], with the title ''Faith and Fundamentalism: Is belief in Richard Dawkins necessary for salvation?'', constituting a continuation of the critique he had begun in ''The London Review of Books''. Introducing his first lecture with an admission of ignorance of both theology and science, Eagleton goes on to affirm: "All I can claim in this respect, alas, is that I think I may know just about enough theology to be able to spot when someone like Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens&nbsp;– a couplet I shall henceforth reduce for convenience to the solitary signifier ''Ditchkins''&nbsp;– is talking out of the back of his neck."<ref>{{cite video |people=Terry Eagleton (lecturer) |date=1 April 2008 |title=Christianity Fair and Foul |url=http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/eagleton.html |format=rm |medium=Podcast |publisher=[[Yale University]] |access-date=4 August 2009 |time=6:23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806031121/http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/eagleton.html |archive-date=6 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Eagleton |first=Terry |title=Faith and Fundamentalism: Is Belief in Richard Dawkins Necessary for Salvation? |work=[[Dwight H.

===Football===
Eagleton sees [[association football|football]] as a new [[opium of the people]] distracting ordinary people from more serious, important social concerns. Eagleton is pessimistic as to whether this distraction can be ended:
{{blockquote|For the most part football these days is the opium of the people, not to speak of their [[crack cocaine]]. Its icon is the impeccably [[Tory]], slavishly conformist [[David Beckham|Beckham]]. [[Manchester United F.C.|The Reds]] are no longer the [[Bolsheviks]]. Nobody serious about political change can shirk the fact that the game has to be abolished. And any political outfit that tried it on would have about as much chance of power as the chief executive of [[BP]] has in taking over from [[Oprah Winfrey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/15/football-socialism-crack-cocaine-people |title=Football: a dear friend to capitalism - Terry Eagleton |first=Terry |last=Eagleton |website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=15 June 2010 |access-date=29 June 2016}}</ref>}}

==Criticism of Martin and Kingsley Amis==
[[File:T.Eagleton & Wang Jie.jpg|thumbnail|right|Eagleton in 2012]]
In late 2007, a critique of [[Martin Amis]] included in the introduction to a 2007 edition of Eagleton's book ''Ideology'' was widely reprinted in the British press. In it, Eagleton took issue with Amis' widely quoted writings on "[[Islamism]]", directing particular attention to one specific passage from an interview with [[Ginny Dougary]] published in ''The Times'' on 9 September 2006. {{blockquote|What can we do to raise the price of them doing this? There's a definite urge – don't you have it? – to say, 'The Muslim community will have to suffer until it gets its house in order.' What sort of suffering? Not letting them travel. Deportation – further down the road. Curtailing of freedoms. Strip-searching people who look like they're from the Middle East or from Pakistan ... Discriminatory stuff, until it hurts the whole community and they start getting tough with their children ... It's a huge dereliction on their part.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ginnydougary.co.uk/the-voice-of-experience/ |title=The voice of experience |access-date=10 November 2018}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}

Eagleton criticised Amis and expressed surprise as to its source, stating: "[these are] not the ramblings of a [[British National Party]] thug ... but the reflections of Martin Amis, leading luminary of the English metropolitan literary world." He drew a connection between Amis and his father (the novelist [[Kingsley Amis]]). Eagleton went on to write that Martin Amis had learned more from his father – whom Eagleton described as a reactionary "racist, anti-Semitic boor, a drink-sodden, self-hating reviler of women, gays and liberals" – than merely "how to turn a shapely phrase." Eagleton added there was  "something rather stomach-churning at the sight of those such as Amis and his political allies, champions of a civilisation that for centuries has wreaked untold carnage throughout the world, shrieking for illegal measures when they find themselves for the first time on the sticky end of the same treatment."<ref name=eagle-kink/>

The essay became a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' in British literary circles. [[Yasmin Alibhai-Brown]], a commentator for ''[[The Independent]]'', wrote an article<ref>{{cite news |last=Alibhai-Brown |first=Yasmin |title=It's time for civilised and honest engagement |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/yasmin-alibhai-brown/yasmin-alibhaibrown-its-time-for-civilised-and-honest-engagement-394480.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009183433/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/yasmin-alibhai-brown/yasmin-alibhaibrown-its-time-for-civilised-and-honest-engagement-394480.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 October 2013 |access-date=1 September 2013 |newspaper=The Independent |date=8 October 2007}}</ref> about the affair, to which Amis responded via open letter, calling Eagleton "an ideological relict ... unable to get out of bed in the morning without the dual guidance of God and Karl Marx."<ref>{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/amis-launches-scathing-response-to-accusations-of-islamophobia-396670.html |title=Amis launches scathing response to accusations of Islamophobia |work=[[The Independent]] |date=12 October 2007 |access-date=1 July 2008}}</ref> Amis said the views Eagleton attributed to him as his considered opinion was in fact his spoken description of a tempting urge, in relation to the need to "raise the price" of terrorist actions. Eagleton's personal comments on [[Kingsley Amis]] prompted a further response from Kingsley's widow, the novelist [[Elizabeth Jane Howard]]. Howard wrote to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', noting that for a supposed "anti-semitic homophobe", it was peculiar that the only guests at the Howard–Amis nuptials were either Jewish or gay.<ref name="amisfamily">{{cite news |last=Cockcroft |first=Lucy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1565696/Family-defends-racist-Sir-Kingsley-Amis.html |title=Family defends 'racist' Sir Kingsley Amis|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=10 October 2007 |access-date=1 July 2008}}</ref> As Howard explained, "Kingsley was never a racist, nor an anti-Semitic boor.

Eagleton defended his comments about Martin and Kingsley Amis in ''[[The Guardian]]'', claiming the main bone of contention – the substance of Amis' remarks and views – had been lost amid the media furore.<ref name=eagle-kink>{{cite news|last=Eagleton|first=Terry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/10/comment.religion|title=Rebuking obnoxious views is not just a personality kink|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 October 2007|access-date=1 July 2008|location=London}}</ref>

==Critical reactions==
[[William Deresiewicz]] wrote of ''After Theory'', Eagleton's book, as follows... :
{{blockquote|[I]s it that hard to explain what Eagleton's up to? The prolificness, the self-plagiarism, the snappy, highly consumable prose and, of course, the sales figures: Eagleton wishes for capitalism's demise, but as long as it's here, he plans to do as well as he can out of it. Someone who owns three homes shouldn't be preaching self-sacrifice, and someone whose careerism at Oxbridge was legendary shouldn't be telling interviewers of his longstanding regret at having turned down a job at the [[Open University]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Deresiewicz |first=William |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/business-theory/ |title=The Business of Theory |work=[[The Nation]] |date=29 January 2004 |access-date=29 October 2015}}</ref>}}

The novelist and critic [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]], writing in the May 2004 ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' on ''[[Literary Theory: An Introduction|Theory]]'' and ''After Theory'', concluded:
{{blockquote|Some of Theory's achievements are genuine and permanent additions to knowledge, or intellectual self-knowledge. Eagleton is quite right to assert that we can never go back to a state of pre-Theory innocence about the transparency of language or the ideological neutrality of interpretation ... But like all fashions it was bound to have a limited life of novelty and vitality, and we are now living through its decadence without any clear indication of what will supersede it. Theory has, in short, become boringly predictable to many people who were once enthusiastic about it, and that ''After Theory'' is most interesting when its focus is furthest from its nominal subject is perhaps evidence that Terry Eagleton is now bored by it too.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lodge |first=David |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2004/may/27/goodbye-to-all-that/|title=Goodbye to All That |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |format=fee required |date=27 May 2004 |access-date=1 July 2008}}</ref>}}

[[Jonathan Bate]] stressed the importance of Eagleton's Roman Catholic background in "Saint Terence", a 1991 review-essay in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' before the overt religious turn in Eagleton's later works.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bate |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v13/n10/jonathan-bate/saint-terence |title=Saint Terence |work=[[London Review of Books]] |access-date=28 August 2020}}</ref>
