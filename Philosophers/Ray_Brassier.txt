'''Raymond Brassier''' ({{IPAc-en|b|r|ə|ˈ|s|i|ər}};<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CsvMc-V4AI&list=PL576VjlGxmjvcbQj3H4oEaNLSFbegY6HD "Thinking About Time Conference"]<!--at 6:33--></ref> born December 22, 1965) is a British [[philosopher]]. He is a member of the philosophy faculty at the [[American University of Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], known for his work in [[philosophical realism]]. He was formerly Research Fellow at the Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy at [[Middlesex University]], London, England. 

Brassier is the author of ''Nihil Unbound: Enlightenment and Extinction'' and the translator of [[Alain Badiou]]'s ''Saint Paul: The Foundation of Universalism'' and ''Theoretical Writings'' and [[Quentin Meillassoux]]'s ''After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency''. He first attained prominence as a leading authority on the works of [[François Laruelle]].

More recently Brassier has engaged with Marxism and the work of the German-American political theorist [[Paul Mattick]].<ref>Ray Brassier "[https://www.e-flux.com/notes/550201/politics-of-the-rift-on-thorie-communiste Politics of the Rift: On Théorie Communiste</ref> In August 2024 it was announced that Brassier would be joining [[Kyung Hee University]] as a visiting professor in the Department of British & American Language and Culture, and in 2025 teach a masters course on [[Marxism]] and [[literature]] with the British theorist and filmmaker [[Jason Barker]].<ref>Kyung Hee University Masters "https://kyungheebalc.crd.co/</ref> 

Brassier is of mixed French-Scottish ancestry.

==Education==
He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[University of North London]] in 1995 and [[Master of Arts]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degrees from the [[University of Warwick]] in 1997 and 2001 respectively.<ref>[http://www.aub.edu.lb/fas/philosophy/pages/aub_phil_people-brassier.aspx AUB - Department of Philosophy - Brassier] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604043713/http://www.aub.edu.lb/fas/philosophy/pages/aub_phil_people-brassier.aspx|date=4 June 2016}}.</ref>

==Philosophical work==
Along with [[Quentin Meillassoux]], [[Graham Harman]], and [[Iain Hamilton Grant]], Brassier is one of the foremost philosophers of contemporary [[speculative realism]] interested in providing a robust defence of [[philosophical realism]] in the wake of the challenges posed to it by post-Kantian critical idealism, phenomenology, post-modernism, deconstruction, or, more broadly speaking, what they refer to as "[[correlationism]]". Brassier is generally credited with coining the term ''speculative realism'', though Meillassoux had earlier used the phrase ''speculative materialism''  ({{langx|fr|matérialisme spéculatif}}) to refer to his own position.

Brassier himself, however, does not identify with the speculative realist movement, and, further, disputes that there even is such a movement, stating:
{{blockquote|The "speculative realist movement" exists only in the imaginations of a group of bloggers promoting an agenda for which I have no sympathy whatsoever: [[actor–network theory]] spiced with [[Panpsychism|pan-psychist]] metaphysics and morsels of [[process philosophy]]. I don't believe the internet is an appropriate medium for serious philosophical debate; nor do I believe it is acceptable to try to concoct a philosophical movement online by using blogs to exploit the misguided enthusiasm of impressionable graduate students. I agree with Deleuze's remark that ultimately the most basic task of philosophy is to impede stupidity, so I see little philosophical merit in a "movement" whose most signal achievement thus far is to have generated an online orgy of stupidity.<ref>Ray Brassier interviewed by Marcin Rychter "[http://kronos.org.pl/index.php?23151,896 I am a nihilist because I still believe in truth]", Kronos, 4 March 2011.</ref>}}

Brassier is strongly critical of much of contemporary philosophy for what he regards as its attempt "to stave off the 'threat' of nihilism by safeguarding the experience of meaning – characterized as the defining feature of human existence – from the Enlightenment logic of disenchantment". According to Brassier, this tendency is exemplified above all by philosophers strongly influenced by [[Heidegger]] and [[Wittgenstein]]. Unlike philosophers such as [[John McDowell]], who would press philosophy into service in an attempt to bring about a "re-enchantment of the world", Brassier's work aims to "push nihilism to its ultimate conclusion".

According to Brassier, "the disenchantment of the world understood as a consequence of the process whereby the Enlightenment shattered the '[[great chain of being]]' and defaced the 'book of the world' is a necessary consequence of the coruscating potency of reason, and hence an invigorating vector of intellectual discovery, rather than a calamitous diminishment".<ref name="Nihil Unbound n.p.">Brassier, Ray. ''Nihil Unbound: Enlightenment and Extinction''.</ref> "Philosophy", exhorts Brassier, "would do well to desist from issuing any further injunctions about the need to re-establish the meaningfulness of existence, the purposefulness of life, or mend the shattered concord between man and nature. It should strive to be more than a sop to the pathetic twinge of human self-esteem. Nihilism is not an existential quandary but a speculative opportunity."<ref name="Nihil Unbound n.p."/>

Brassier's work attempts to fuse elements of post-war French philosophy with ideas arising from the (largely Anglo-American) traditions of [[philosophical naturalism]], [[cognitive science]], and [[neurophilosophy]]. Thus, along with French philosophers such as [[François Laruelle]], [[Alain Badiou]], and [[Quentin Meillassoux]], he is also heavily influenced by the likes of [[Paul Churchland]], [[Thomas Metzinger]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]. He also draws heavily, albeit often negatively, on the work of [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and [[Martin Heidegger]].

Brassier's work has often been associated with contemporary philosophies of nihilism and pessimism. In an interview ''[[True Detective]]'' creator and writer [[Nic Pizzolatto]] gave he cited Brassier's ''Nihil Unbound'' as an influence on the TV series, along with [[Thomas Ligotti]]'s ''[[The Conspiracy Against the Human Race]]'', Jim Crawford's ''Confessions of an Antinatalist'', [[Eugene Thacker]]'s ''In The Dust of This Planet'', and [[David Benatar]]'s ''[[Better Never to Have Been]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Calia|first=Michael  |date=2 February 2014 |title=Writer Nic Pizzolatto on Thomas Ligotti and the Weird Secrets of 'True Detective' |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/02/02/writer-nic-pizzolatto-on-thomas-ligotti-and-the-weird-secrets-of-true-detective/ |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=3 May 2019}}</ref>
