'''Stanisław Wawrzyniec Staszic''' {{IPAc-pl|s|t|a|'|ń|i|s|ł|a|f|-|'|s|t|a|sz|i|c}} (baptised 6 November 1755 – 20 January 1826) was a leading figure in the [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish Enlightenment]]: a Catholic priest, philosopher, geologist, writer, poet, [[translation|translator]] and [[Politician|statesman]]. A [[Physiocracy|physiocrat]], [[Monism|monist]], [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavist]] (after 1815) and [[laissez-faire|laissez-fairist]], he supported many reforms in Poland. He is particularly remembered for his political writings during the "[[Great Sejm|Great (Four-Year) Sejm]]" (1788–92) and for his large support towards the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], adopted by that Sejm.

He co-founded the [[Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning]] (precursor to the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]), of which he became president. He served as a member of the [[State Council (Duchy of Warsaw)|State Council]] of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and as minister of trade and industry in [[Congress Poland]]. Staszic is seen as the father of Polish geology, statistics, sociology, [[Tatra Mountains]] studies and exploration, mining and industry.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===

Stanisław Staszic was born into a [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] family in the town of [[Piła]] (he was baptised on 6 November 1755), the youngest of four siblings.<ref name="psb540" /> His father, [[Wawrzyniec Staszic]], was mayor of Piła and a royal secretary.<ref name="psb540" /> His brothers were Antoni (1743–1775) and Andrzej (1745–1825), a priest.<ref name="psb540" />

Staszic attended secondary school at [[Wałcz]]. He studied [[theology]] and graduated from a [[Jesuit]] school at [[Poznań]] in 1778 and was [[ordination|ordained]] a Catholic priest (he took lesser [[Holy orders]] in 1774, and higher orders about 1778–79).<ref name="psb540" /> Between 1779 and 1781 he continued his studies in France at the [[Collège de France]], where he took classes in physics and [[natural history]].<ref name="psb541" />

On returning to Poland in 1781, he accepted a position as tutor in the house of [[Grand Crown Chancellor]] [[Andrzej Zamoyski]].<ref name="psb541" /> In 1782 he received a doctorate from the [[Zamojski Academy]].<ref name="psb541" /> He translated several works from French into Polish and briefly worked at the academy as a teacher of French language.<ref name="psb541" />

=== Reformer ===
[[File:Stanislaw Staszic by Barwicki.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Staszic by W. Barwicki]] 
His ''Remarks upon the Life of [[Jan Zamoyski]]'' (''Uwagi nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego'', 1787), published anonymously on the eve of the [[Great Sejm]], transformed the little-known tutor into one of the chief political thinkers of the late 18th-century Commonwealth.<ref name="Bauer" /> It became a model for other similar works<ref name="psb541" /> and began a flood of political books and pamphlets unprecedented in the Commonwealth's history.<ref name="Bauer" /> It was reprinted numerous times, including in unauthorized editions.<ref name="psb541" />

Within his ''Remarks'', Staszic did not portray the life of Jan Zamoyski (1542–1605, one of the most prominent statesmen in Polish history<ref name="Lerski1996"/>); rather, he argued that reforms are needed, and that Zamoyski had already proposed or supported many of them two centuries before.<ref name="Bauer" /> Staszic was a strong partisan of reforms and an ardent advocate for the interests of the lower classes.<ref name="Bauer" /> He advocated the abolition of the [[serfdom]] and improvements of the peasants' fate (by granting them land and private rights).<ref name="Bauer" /> He criticised the [[szlachta]] (Polish nobility) for [[Golden Liberty|inefficient governance]], and argued that it showed itself too inept to be allowed to govern alone.<ref name="Bauer" /><ref name="Grze?kowiak-Krwawicz2012"/> He argued for a slight increase in taxes, which should allow the Commonwealth to create an army of 100,000 that would at least stand a chance against the still-larger armies of its neighbours.<ref name="Bauer" /> Although he preferred [[republicanism]] in theory, in the Commonwealth context he agreed that a strengthening of the central (royal) power was the most practical solution for reforming the country, in line with the similar developments elsewhere in Europe.<ref name="Bauer" /><ref name="Grze?kowiak-Krwawicz2012"/> In ''Remarks'' he even supported the introduction of an [[absolute monarchy]] in Poland.<ref name="psb543" />

Staszic was a keen observer of the proceedings of the Great Sejm, spending much time in Warsaw since the Sejm began its deliberations in 1788.<ref name="psb542" /> He continued publishing new books and pamphlets.<ref name="psb542" /> His ''Warnings for Poland, coming from the current European politics and natural laws, by the writer of the remarks upon the life of Jan Zamoyski'' (''Przestrogi dla Polski z teraźniejszych politycznych Europy związków i z praw natury wypadające przez pisarza uwag nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego'', 1790), together with his previous ''Remarks'', are considered among the most influential works of the Polish Enlightenment.<ref name="psb542" /> In ''Warnings'', he criticised the [[magnates of Poland and Lithuania]], [[monasticism|monastic order]]s and serfdom, and supported the enfranchisement of the townsfolk.<ref name="psb543" /> Although he was not a participant of the Sejm, he was an influential onlooker, and through his widely read and discussed writings of the time is recognized as one of the founding fathers of the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]].<ref name="TrencsényiKopeček2006">{{cite book|author1=Balázs Trencsényi|author2=Michal Kopeček|title=Discourses of Collective Identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945): Texts and Commentaries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5Vsjg508EYC&pg=PA88|access-date=11 April 2013|year=2006|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-7326-52-3|pages=88–89}}</ref><ref name="Stone2001"/><ref name="Suziedelis2011"/>

During 1790–1791 he accompanied Zamoyski's family on a trip abroad, and continued to serve as an adviser to the family, although his relations with the sons ([[Aleksander August Zamoyski]], [[Stanisław Kostka Zamoyski]]) had become strained; he would eventually align himself with the daughter of the family, [[Anna Zamoyska]] (Anna Jadwiga Sapieżyna).<ref name="psb542" /> He supported the 1794 [[Kościuszko Uprising]], a failed attempt to liberate Commonwealth from foreign influence following the events of the 1793 [[Second Partition of Poland]], donating money to the insurgents' cause.<ref name="psb542" /> Upon the defeat of the Uprising, he accompanied the family on their trip to [[Vienna]].<ref name="psb542" /> He also made some successful financial investments, including in the stock market.<ref name="psb543" /> He then served as an economic adviser for the Zamoyski and the [[Sapieha family|Sapieha families]], invested in their estates, and lent them money.<ref name="psb543" />

=== Late life ===

[[File:Portret Staszica w granatowym fraku.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Staszic, 1820s]]
After Poland's [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]], in which Russia, Prussia, and Austria seized all of the Commonwealth's territory, Staszic was active in many scientific and scholarly initiatives. He studied the geology of the [[Carpathian Mountains]].<ref name="psb543" /> In 1800 he co-founded the [[Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning]]; from 1802 he was one of its most active members.<ref name="psb543" /> In 1804 he went to France, where he observed the changes wrought by Napoleon.<ref name="psb543" /> On return to Poland in 1805, he spent some time in the [[Tatra Mountains]], where he continued his geological studies and conducted [[ethnography|ethnographic]] ones. He worked with [[Jan Chrystian Hoffmann]] on a geological map of Poland.<ref name="psb544" /> In the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] he worked with the Ministry of Education (''Izba Edukacyjna Księstwa Warszawskiego'') and was involved in numerous educational reforms and initiatives.<ref name="psb544" /> He also briefly worked with the Ministry of Treasury.<ref name="psb544" />

From 1808 he was president of the [[Society of Friends of Learning]] (''Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk'', or ''TPN''), forerunner to the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (''Polska Akademia Nauk''); he would be elected repeatedly as the society's president until his death.<ref name="psb544" /> In 1808 he also became [[referendary]] to the [[State Council (Duchy of Warsaw)|State Council]] (''Rada Stanu'') of the Duchy; in 1810 he became a full member.<ref name="psb544" /> In the council, he was active in regard to questions of education and the economy.<ref name="psb545" /> As ''TPN'' president he was active in many initiatives which supported and popularized science in Poland.<ref name="psb545" /> He oversaw the construction of a headquarters for the ''TPN'', which came to be known as the "[[Staszic Palace]]".<ref name="psb547" /><ref name="psb549" />

From 1814 he supported the [[Russian Empire]], seen as a [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]] ally of Poland, and favored the idea of a great [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] monarchy.<ref name="psb545" /><ref name="psb546" /> After the fall of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1815, he became a member of the government of the newly created small state of [[Congress Poland]] (in [[personal union]] with Russia), initially in the new Ministry of Education and Religion, in 1816 serving as deputy minister.<ref name="psb546" /> In 1815 he was decorated with the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]].<ref name="psb546" /> In 1819 he endorsed a controversial censorship law, damaging his reputation.<ref name="psb547" />

His 1815 Polish translation of Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' met with a negative reception.<ref name="psb546" /> In 1816–20 he published many of his writings in a 9-volume ''Works'' (''Dzieła'').<ref name="psb547" /> Volumes 7–9 comprised his ''Humankind: A Didactic Poem'' (''Ród Ludzki. Poema Dydaktyczne''), a gigantic philosophical essay and poem that is regarded as an important contribution to the [[history of Polish philosophy]].<ref name="psb547" /> However, the work ran afoul of the new censorship law and was not distributed, much of the edition eventually being destroyed.<ref name="psb547" />

He also carried out studies on education and on human behavior, in a social-science tradition.<ref name="psb547" /> Some of his views and theories made him a precursor of [[evolution]]ism in the natural and social sciences.<ref name="psb549" /> In his essays on human nature, he declared for the primacy of science and was relatively critical of the influence of religion.<ref name="psb547" /> These views gained him some critics, as he was seen as a priest who had abandoned religion.<ref name="psb549" />

From 1816 he was involved in mining research and projects.<ref name="psb547" /> He also actively supported industrial development in Poland.<ref name="psb547" /><ref name="psb548" /> He was one of the first to see the importance of coal, and supported the development of [[metallurgy]]-related projects, from mines to zinc and [[steel mills]].<ref name="psb548" /> He was also involved in the development of [[ceramic]] and textile industries, and improving the transport infrastructure (roads, canals).<ref name="psb548" /> He discovered coal deposits in [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]], where he initiated the building of a coal mine. Between 1816 and 1824 he was the ''de facto'' minister of industry of the Congress Poland (styled officially the "director of the Department of Trade, Crafts and Industry") and initiated construction of the [[Old Polish Industrial Area]] (''[[Staropolski Okręg Przemysłowy]]'').<ref name="psb547" /><ref name="psb548" /> As his projects did not result in quick returns, he incurred increasing criticism, and eventually resigned from his position in 1824.<ref name="psb548" />

In 1816 he founded the ''[[Hrubieszowskie Towarzystwo Rolnicze]]'' ([[Hrubieszów]] Agricultural Society),<ref name="psb546" /> seen by some as the first Polish [[cooperative]].<ref name="hrubieszow" />
[[File:Grobowiec Stanisława Staszyca na Bielanach (44813).jpg|thumb|upright|Grave in Warsaw]]
He died in Warsaw on 20 January 1826, most likely due to a stroke.<ref name="psb549" /> His funeral gathered 20,000 people, including the viceroy of the Congress Poland, [[Józef Zajączek]].<ref name="psb549" /> He was buried in the [[Camaldolese Church, Warsaw|Camaldolese Hermit Monastery]] in Warsaw.<ref name="psb549" /> His testament left his property at Hrubieszów to its tenants, and much of his wealth went to various philanthropic initiatives.<ref name="psb548" />

== Private life ==

Staszic was remembered by his contemporaries as a loner and not a person who was quick to make friends.<ref name="psb549" /> He has been described as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage.<ref name="psb549" /> He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries.<ref name="psb549" /> He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.<ref name="psb549" />

== Remembrance ==
[[File:Pomnik Stanisław Staszic.jpg|170px|thumb|Stanisław Staszic monument in [[Kielce]]]]

In April 1951, he was honoured on a postage stamp of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] as part of the set issued for the First Congress of Polish Science.<ref name="denomination" /> His figure was popular among the [[Marxism|Marxist]] scholars of the People's Republic, who stressed his materialist, determinist and anti-clerical views.<ref name="psb549" /> The 150th anniversary of his death in 1976 was also celebrated, with many works dedicated to him, including poems by [[Jan Czeczot]] and [[Jan Lohmann]].<ref name="psb549" /> He has been made a patron of over 200 schools, including the [[AGH University of Science and Technology]] in Kraków.<ref name="psb549" /> There are statues of Stanisław Staszic in [[Łódź]], [[Kielce]], Hrubieszów and Dąbrowa Górnicza.<ref name="psb549" /> Several geographical landmarks, minerals and a bacterium bear his name as well.<ref name="psb549" /> In Piła, there is a [[Museum of Stanisław Staszic]], which has gathered various artifacts related to him, and publishes a journal, "Zeszyty Staszicowskie" (''Staszic Notebooks'').<ref name="psb550" />
