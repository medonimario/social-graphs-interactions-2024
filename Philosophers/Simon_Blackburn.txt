==Philosophical work==
In philosophy, he is best known as the proponent of [[quasi-realism]] in [[meta-ethics]]<ref name="plato.stanford.edu">{{Cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/projectivism-quasi-realism.html |title=Moral Anti-Realism > Projectivism and Quasi-realism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |access-date=27 October 2019 |archive-date=1 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200501120536/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/projectivism-quasi-realism.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> and as a defender of neo-[[Humeanism#Metaethics|Humean]] views on a variety of topics. "The quasi-realist is someone who endorses an anti-realist metaphysical stance but who seeks, through philosophical maneuvering, to earn the right for moral discourse to enjoy all the trappings of realist talk."<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/>

In 2008 ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'', which was authored by Blackburn, was published.

In 2014 Blackburn published ''Mirror, Mirror: The Uses and Abuses of Self-Love'', focusing on different philosophical aspects of self-love, discussing modern forms and manifestations of pride, amour-propre, integrity or self-esteem through various philosophical frameworks and ideas.<ref>{{Cite journal|author-link=Lorraine Besser-Jones|last=Besser-Jones|first=Lorraine|date=2014-09-01|title=Review of Mirror, Mirror: The Uses and Abuses of Self-Love|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/mirror-mirror-the-uses-and-abuses-of-self-love/|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|issn=1538-1617}}</ref>

==Public philosophy==

He makes occasional appearances in the British media, such as on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The Moral Maze]]''.

He is a patron of [[Humanists UK]] (formerly the British Humanist Association), and when asked to define his atheism, he said he prefers the label ''infidel'' over ''atheist'':
{{blockquote|Being an infidel, that is, just having no faith, I do not have to prove anything. I have no faith in the Loch Ness Monster, but do not go about trying to prove that it does not exist, although there are certainly overwhelming arguments that it does not.<ref name="here">Philosophy Now's interview with Simon Blackburn, November 2013, accessible [http://philosophynow.org/issues/99/Simon_Blackburn here]</ref>}}

He was one of 55 public figures to sign an open letter published in ''The Guardian'' in September 2010, stating their opposition to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s state visit to the UK,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/15/harsh-judgments-on-pope-religion|title=Letters: Harsh judgments on the pope and religion|work=The Guardian|access-date=16 September 2010 | location=London | date=15 September 2010}}</ref> and has argued that "religionists" should have less influence in political affairs.<ref name="here"/>

He was one of 240 academics to sign a letter to the Equality and Human Rights Commission opposing 'radical gender orthodoxy', published in The Sunday Times.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/we-will-not-bow-to-trans-activist-bullies-on-campus-5hb6sjxc6|title=We will not bow to trans activist bullies on campus}}</ref>

In a televised debate, Blackburn argued against the position of the author and podcaster [[Sam Harris]] that morality can be derived straightforwardly from science.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtH3Q54T-M8| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315012235/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtH3Q54T-M8&gl=US&hl=en| archive-date=2013-03-15 | url-status=dead|title=The Great Debate - Can Science Tell Us Right From Wrong?
