'''Mary Astell''' (12 November 1666 – 11 May 1731) was an English [[protofeminist]] writer, philosopher, and [[rhetorician]] who advocated for equal [[educational opportunities for women]]. Astell is primarily remembered as one of England's inaugural advocates for women's rights and some commentators consider her to have been "the first English feminist."<ref name="litencyc">Batchelor, Jennie, "[http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=168 Mary Astell]". ''The Literary Encyclopedia''. 21 March 2002. Accessed 6 July 2008.</ref>  

Astell's works, particularly ''A Serious Proposal to the Ladies'' and ''Some Reflections Upon Marriage'', argue for the fundamental intellectual equality between men and women. Her philosophical writings are thought to have influenced subsequent generations of educated women, including the literary group known as the [[Bluestocking|Bluestockings]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Duran |first=Jane |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt1xcn4h |title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, and Feminism |date=2006 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-03022-2 |jstor=10.5406/j.ctt1xcn4h }}</ref> Astell, who never married, formed the majority of her close personal relationships with women. During the early 1700s, she withdrew from public life and dedicated herself to planning and managing a charitable school for girls. Astell considered herself a self-reliant, modern woman, one who was on a definite mission to rescue her sex from the oppression of men.<ref name="kinnaird">{{Cite journal |last=Kinnaird |first=Joan K. |date=1979 |title=Mary Astell and the Conservative Contribution to English Feminism |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=53–75 |doi=10.1086/385747 |issn=1545-6986 |s2cid=161848352}}</ref>

Despite Astell's contribution to the feminist cause, there is a notable tension in the broader body of scholarship when it comes to categorising her as the unequivocal "first English feminist." This discrepancy arises due to Astell's conflicting intellectual commitments. In addition to her belief in women's inherent intellectual potential and her thorough exploration of the perils of oppressive husbands, Mary Astell was a staunch [[High Tory]], a conservative pamphleteer, and an advocate for the doctrine of passive obedience.<ref name=":2" /> Even during their initial publication, her strongest political views may have seemed outdated and out of touch with the prevailing beliefs of the time. Furthermore, her emphasis on the importance of religion to female friendship and [[feminist thought]] has rankled contemporary critics of her work.<ref name="kinnaird" />

== Early life ==

Few records of Mary Astell's life have survived. As biographer Ruth Perry explains: "as a woman she had little or no business in the world of commerce, politics, or law. She was born, she died; she owned a small house for some years; she kept a bank account; she helped to open a [[charity school]] in Chelsea: these facts the public listings can supply."<ref>Perry, 22.</ref> Only four of her letters were saved and these because they had been written to important men of the period. Researching the biography, Perry uncovered more letters and manuscript fragments, but she notes that if Astell had not written to wealthy aristocrats who could afford to pass down entire estates, very little of her life would have survived.<ref>Perry, 23.</ref>

Mary Astell was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] on 12 November 1666, to Peter and Mary (Errington) Astell.<ref name="smith2">Smith, ''Mary Astell'', 2.</ref> Her parents had two other children, William, who died in infancy, and Peter, her younger brother.<ref name="smith2"/><ref>Sutherland, ''Eloquence'', xi.</ref> She was baptised in [[St John the Baptist Church, Newcastle upon Tyne|St John's Church in Newcastle]].<ref name="Mary Astell">{{cite web|title=Mary Astell |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/astell.html |publisher=Oregon State |access-date=1 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221153142/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/astell.html |archive-date=21 February 2015 }}</ref> Her family was upper-middle class and lived in Newcastle throughout her early childhood. Her father was a coal merchant, a clerk within the [[Hostmen of Newcastle upon Tyne]] and a conservative royalist [[Anglicanism|Anglican]].<ref name="litencyc"/><ref name=":3" /> Mary's maternal grandfather was also a coal merchant and a member of the Hostmen guild.<ref name=":3" /> Due to her family's success within the coal business her family had grown to achieve relative affluence. At the time of Mary's birth, her family was not part of the [[gentry]]. Within the year of Mary's birth her family would be elevated in status after an ancestor's augmentation.<ref name=":3" /> Mary received no formal education, although she did receive an informal education from her uncle Ralph Astell; he was a Cambridge graduate<ref>{{Acad|name=Ralph Astell|id=ASTL650R}}</ref> and a former clergyman whose alcoholism had prompted his suspension from the [[Church of England]].<ref>{{cite book|editor=Donawerth, Jane|title=Rhetorical Theory by Women before 1900: an anthology|year=2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7425-1717-2|pages=100}}</ref> Though suspended from the Church, he was affiliated with the [[Cambridge Platonists|Cambridge-based philosophical school]] that based its teachings around philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]], and [[Pythagoras]].<ref name="Astell, Mary">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Astell, Mary|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Mary_Astell.aspx#1|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Biography|access-date=28 April 2011}}</ref> Her father died when she was 12 years old,<ref name="litencyc"/> leaving her without a dowry.  With the remainder of the family finances invested in her brother's higher education, Mary and her mother moved to live with Mary's aunt.

After moving in with her aunt, little is known about Mary Astell's life until she was in her early twenties. It is possible that she continued to receive informal education from her uncle, but there is no concrete evidence. It is possible that Mary's lack of a dowry and her family's financial situation may have limited her opportunities for further education or advancement. It is not known if she had any close friends or if she was involved in any romantic relationships. It is unclear if she was involved in any political or social causes during this time, although her later writings suggest an interest in issues related to women's education and equality.

After the death of her mother and aunt in 1688, Astell moved to [[Chelsea, London]], where she became acquainted with a circle of literary and influential women, including [[Lady Mary Chudleigh]], [[Elizabeth Thomas (poet, born 1675)|Elizabeth Thomas]], [[Judith Drake]], [[Elizabeth Elstob]], and [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]].<ref>Sowaal, Alice. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/astell/ "Mary Astell"], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (2005), 16 December 2006.</ref> These helped develop and publish her work, as did [[William Sancroft]], previously Archbishop of Canterbury. Believing himself bound by his previous oath to James II, he refused to swear allegiance to [[William III of England|William III]] after the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] and became a [[Nonjuring schism|Nonjuror]]. He provided financial support and an introduction to her future publisher; Astell later dedicated a collection of poetry to him.<ref name=henderson>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecrownchronicles.co.uk/history/mary-astell-the-first-feminist/|title=Mary Astell: the first feminist? • The Crown Chronicles|last=Henderson-Bryan|first=Bethanie|date=2018-05-12|website=The Crown Chronicles|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref>

During this time, it is believed that Astell may have spent some time at a [[convent]] in France, where she was exposed to ideas about women's education and independence.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Sutherland |first=Christine Mason |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/166335051 |title=The eloquence of Mary Astell |date=2005 |publisher=University of Calgary Press |isbn=978-1-55238-459-6 |location=Calgary, Alta. |oclc=166335051}}</ref> Upon her return to England, Astell became a valued member of the group of intellectual women known as the [[Blue Stockings Society|Bluestocking]]s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Myers |first=Sylvia Harcstark |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21040567 |title=The bluestocking circle : women, friendship, and the life of the mind in eighteenth-century England |date=1990 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=0-19-811767-1 |location=Oxford |oclc=21040567}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web |last=Team |first=Project Vox |title=Astell (1666-1731) |url=https://projectvox.org/astell-1666-1731/ |access-date=2023-05-02 |website=Project Vox |language=en}}</ref> The exact date of her entry into the circle is not known, but it is believed to have been in the early 1690s. The bluestockings gathered to discuss literature, science, and philosophy, and their discussions often centred on issues related to women's education and equality. Astell's participation in these conversations influenced her later work.<ref name=":0" />

She was one of the first English women, following [[Bathsua Makin]], to advocate the idea that women were just as rational as men, and just as deserving of education. First published anonymously and signed "By a Lover of her Sex" in 1694, her ''A Serious Proposal to the Ladies for the Advancement of their True and Greatest Interest'' presents a plan for an all-female college where women could pursue a life of the mind.<ref>[http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/womenLit/education/Astell_L.htm "Mary Astell"].

In 1700, Astell published ''Some Reflections upon Marriage''.<ref>Astell, Mary, 1668–1731, [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/astell/marriage/marriage.html ''Some Reflections Upon Marriage, Occasioned by the Duke and Dutchess of Mazarine's Case; Which is Also Considered''], London: Printed for John Nutt, near Stationers-Hall, 1700.</ref> She critiques the philosophical underpinnings of the institution of marriage in 1700s England, warning women of the dangers of a hasty or ill-considered choice. The [[Hortense Mancini|Duchess of Mazarin]] is used as an example of "the dangers of an ill Education and unequal Marriage". Astell argues that education will help women to make better matrimonial choices and meet the challenges of the married state: "She has need of a strong Reason, of a truly Christian and well-temper'd Spirit, of all the Assistance the best Education can give her, and ought to have some good assurance of her own Firmness and Vertue, who ventures on such a Trial".

Astell warns that disparity in intelligence, character, and fortune may lead to misery, and recommends that marriage be based on lasting friendship rather than short-lived attraction. A woman should look for "a good Understanding, a Vertuous Mind, and in all other respects let there be as much equality as may be." Astell expanded on this theme in response to critics in the third edition of ''Some Reflections upon Marriage''.<ref name="Astell, Mary"/>

[[File:Reflections upon Marriage.jpg|thumb|Cover page from 1706 edition of ''Reflections upon Marriage'']]

She withdrew from public life in 1709 to become head of a charity school for girls in Chelsea, funded by two wealthy philanthropists, [[Lady Catherine Jones]] and [[Lady Elizabeth Hastings]]. Backed by the [[Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge]], Astell designed the school's curriculum and it is thought to be the first school in England with an all-women Board of Governors.{{sfn|Scott|1983|p=100}} When she was 60 years old, Astell went to live with Lady Catherine Jones, with whom she resided until her death in 1731.{{sfn|Donawerth|2002|p=100}}

Astell died in London a few months after a [[mastectomy]] to remove a cancerous right breast. In her last days, she refused to see any of her acquaintances and stayed in a room with her coffin, thinking only of God; she was buried in the churchyard of [[Chelsea Old Church|Chelsea Church]] in London.<ref name="Mary Astell"/>

Astell is remembered for her ability to debate with both men and women, and for her groundbreaking methods of negotiating the position of women in society by engaging in philosophical debate ([[René Descartes|Descartes]] was a particular influence) rather than basing her arguments in historical evidence as had been attempted. Descartes' theory of dualism, a separate mind and body, allowed Astell to promote the idea that women, as well as men, had the ability to reason, and subsequently, they should not be treated so poorly: "If all Men are born Free, why are all Women born Slaves?"<ref>Astell, ''Reflections'', 107.</ref>

==Books==

Mary Astell's works were published anonymously. Her two best-known books, ''A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, for the Advancement of Their True and Greatest Interest'' (1694) and ''A Serious Proposal, Part II'' (1697), outline her plan to establish a new type of institution for women to assist in providing women with both religious and secular education. She suggests extending women's career options beyond mother and nun. She felt uneducated women were concerned with beauty and vanity, and this lack of education was the root of their inferiority to men, not that they were naturally inferior. Astell wanted all women to have the same opportunity as men to spend eternity in heaven with God, and she believed that for this they needed to be educated and to understand their experiences. The 'nunnery' style education she proposed would enable women to live in a protected environment, without the influences of the external patriarchal society.

Her proposal was never adopted because critics said it seemed "too Catholic" for the English. Later her ideas about women were satirised in ''[[The Tatler (1709 journal)|The Tatler]]'' by the writer [[Jonathan Swift]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Mary Astell|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Mary_Astell.aspx#3|encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia|access-date=28 April 2011}}</ref> While the writer [[Daniel Defoe]] admired the first part of Astell's proposal, he believed that her recommendations were "impracticable." Patricia Springborg notes that Defoe's own recommendation for an academy for women as detailed in his ''[[An Essay Upon Projects]]'' did not significantly differ from Astell's original proposal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Astell|first=Mary|title=A Serious Proposal to the Ladies|editor=Patricia Springborg|year=2002|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Peterborough|isbn=978-1-55111-306-7 |pages=15}}</ref> Despite this, she was still an intellectual force in London's educated classes.

A few years later, Astell published the second part of ''A Serious Proposal'', detailing her own vision of women's education for courtly ladies. She broke away from the contemporary rhetorical style of the period where orators spoke before an audience for learning, and instead offered a conversational style of teaching "neighbours" the proper way of behaviour. She referred only to the [[Port-Royal Logic]] as a source of contemporary influence, though still relied upon classical rhetorical theories as she presented her own original ideas. In her presentation, she offered that rhetoric, as an art, does not require a male education to be master, and listed the means of which a woman could acquire the necessary skills from natural logic, which established Astell as a capable female rhetorician.{{sfn|Donawerth|2002|p=101}}

In the early 1690s Astell entered into correspondence with [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] of [[Bemerton]], after reading Norris's ''Practical Discourses, upon several Divine subjects''. The letters illuminate Astell's thoughts on God and theology. Norris thought the letters worthy of publication and had them published with Astell's consent as ''Letters Concerning the Love of God'' (1695). Her name did not appear in the book, but her identity was soon discovered and her rhetorical style was much lauded by contemporaries.

== Philosophy ==

=== Friendship ===
One of Astell's notable contributions to 18th-century ideas of female friendship rests on the political exigencies of forming alliances.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Friendship's Shadows: Women's Friendship and the Politics of Betrayal in England, 1640-1705|last=Anderson|first=Penelope|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2012|pages=222–259|chapter=Covert Politics and Separatist Women’s Friendship: Margaret Cavendish and Mary Astell}}</ref> Jacqueline Broad views Astell's bond of friendship as more Aristotelian where alliances are formed for the sake of virtuous reciprocity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Broad|first=Jacqueline|date=Fall 2018|title=Mary Astell on Virtuous Friendship|doi=10.1353/pgn.0.0169|journal=Parergon|volume=26|issue=2|pages=65–86|s2cid=144922270|url=https://philarchive.org/rec/BROMAO-2 }}</ref> However, Nancy Kendrick does not accept Broad's viewpoint. She feels Astell's "theory of friendship is determinedly anti-Aristotelian." Although Astell embraced the Aristotelian friendship of moral virtue, Kendrick claims that Astell treated "virtuous friends as those who love one another for who they essentially are" and not just for reciprocity's sake. Contrary to Aristotle, Astell contends that authentic virtuous friendship arose from the Divine Nature of God, thus becoming spiritual friendship. Furthermore, Astell, unlike Aristotle, saw this love in friendship extending toward one's enemies because Divine Love embraces all of mankind.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kendrick|first=Nancy|date=Fall 2018|title=Mary Astell's Theory of Spiritual Friendship|journal=British Journal for the History of Philosophy|volume=26|pages=46–65|doi=10.1080/09608788.2017.1347869|s2cid=172046217}}</ref>

=== Education for women ===
Astell believed in the importance of educating women and argued for their intellectual development, primarily in "A Serious Proposal to the Ladies". She challenged prevailing notions that women were intellectually inferior to men, pointing to an innate equality between the minds of men and women.<ref name=":3" /> Astell criticized the limited educational opportunities available to women in her time, which often focused on domestic skills and accomplishments. She advocated for a comprehensive education that would enable women to participate in society, engage in intellectual discourse, and contribute to the public sphere. Astell thought that a proper education was crucial for women to attain social and intellectual independence, allowing them to break free from the constraints imposed by patriarchal society.

Astell believed that women should be educated in a spiritual environment, away from society with only other females. She felt that women should receive an education free of male influence because of how corrupt the world under male dominance was.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Detlefsen |first=Karen |author-link=Karen Detlefsen |date=2016 |title=Custom, freedom and equality: Mary Astell on marriage and women's education |url=https://philpapers.org/archive/DETCFA.pdf |access-date=2018-12-04 |website=philpapers.org}}</ref> To accomplish these aims, her serious proposal entailed the establishment of a monastery-like institution where young women could receive an education and older women could retire. Astell held that this education should be composed of subjects traditionally dominated by men, such as philosophy and theology, along with a strong religious component.

===Marriage===

Astell viewed herself as self-reliant and took pride advancing her mission to rescue her sex without the help of male authority, whom she felt kept women in a place of subjugation.

Astell's ''Some Reflections upon Marriage'', goes into the experiences of women in early modern marriages, with a specific focus on the separation of [[Hortense Mancini]] from her abusive husband.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mary Astell and Hortence Mancini: A Philosopher's Take on Domestic Hell |url=http://www.sandrineberges.com/2/post/2021/07/mary-astell-and-hortence-mancini-a-philosophers-take-on-domestic-hell.html |access-date=2023-05-02 |website=Sandrine Berges |language=en}}</ref> Astell asserts that marriage’s current state is far from its original sanctity as a holy institution established by God due to the moral deficiencies of human beings, specifically men.<ref name=":1" /> She warns women against blindly submitting to their husbands' will and advocates for the education of women to fortify their virtue and reason.

Scholars have suggested that Astell's ''Reflections'' contain a veiled political subtext challenging the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] theorists of her time to extend the same authority granted to husbands in the domestic sphere to sovereigns in the state.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Leduc |first=Guyonne |date=2010-06-01 |title=The Representation of Women's Status in Domestic and Political Patriarchy in Mary Astell and Mary Wollstonecraft |url=https://journals.openedition.org/rfcb/6108 |journal=Revue Française de Civilisation Britannique. French Journal of British Studies |language=en |volume=XV |issue=4 |doi=10.4000/rfcb.6108 |issn=0248-9015|doi-access=free |hdl=20.500.12210/63383 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> By questioning the acceptance of submission and obedience to authority in the home, but not in the state, Astell presents an ironic challenge to Whig opponents. As a result, Astell concluded that Whig theorists should practise passive obedience to their political leaders.

[[George Ballard (biographer)|George Ballard]], Astell's eighteenth-century biographer, stated that although she never married, she had been proposed to by an eminent clergyman but the marriage negotiations broke down, leaving Astell disappointed.<ref name=kinnaird />

===Religion and politics===

Astell makes jabs at [[John Locke]] critiquing ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and ''The Reasonableness of Christianity'', along with other works she regards as [[Deism|deist]] or [[Socinianism|Socinian]]. She attacks his scepticism of the scriptural truth and divinity of Jesus Christ, objecting strongly that Christ is merely an 'extraordinary person,'<ref name="Cohen 2014 164–180">{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Simona|date=2014|title=Animal Imagery in Renaissance Art|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|volume=67|issue=1|pages=164–180|doi=10.1086/676155|s2cid=191615584 |issn=0034-4338}}</ref> and that there is no difference between the Christian and Islamic belief in God. In sections 2 and 3 of ''The Christian Religion'', Astell focused on "Duty to God" and "Duty to Our Neighbour," Astell presents all humans 'are brethren' and sinful pride leads us to treat others as 'creatures of a different species.' This thought rests alongside her beliefs in the essential nature of hierarchical distinctions, which she explains by stating that God's works 'do not necessarily possess the same degree of perfection.'<ref name="Cohen 2014 164–180"/>

Some have questioned how Astell could be both a feminist and a [[High Tory|High-Church Tory]] given her disapproval of Locke's political views and her opposition to Whig theories of liberty, resistance and tolerance. At first glance, her support for a political party that fights [[freedom of conscience]] and other perceived dangers to the [[Anglican church]] seems in opposition with her advocacy for women's freedom of judgment. Scholars have seen that Astell's feminism is not founded on liberal political objectives but rather on intellectual premises.<ref name=":1" /> This explains why, at the time, she did not demand complete political equality for women.

Having been exposed in her youth to civil unrest and riots in the streets of Newcastle is probably what helped develop her interest in politics. She had idealised [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and viewed his successors, [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]], as "illegitimate" rulers to the throne of England.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Celebrated Mary Astell|last=Perry|first=Ruth|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0-226-66093-6|location=Chicago|pages=[https://archive.org/details/celebratedmaryas00perr/page/41 41–42]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/celebratedmaryas00perr/page/41}}</ref> Her [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] politics and English patriotism led her to reflect that 'it is better some innocents should suffer than the majesty of government, and herein the divine authority should be violated."<ref name="oxfordbibliographies.com" /><ref name="Cohen 2014 164–180" />

According to Astell's Anglican political theology, all subjects are required to adhere to the notion of [[passive obedience]], which mandates that they must willingly surrender to political authority.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Springborg |first=Patricia |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/68925923 |title=Mary Astell : theorist of freedom from domination |date=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-511-13714-1 |location=Cambridge |oclc=68925923}}</ref>  When they are unable to do so openly, they must submit to the punishment for it. Even if the crown had [[Dictator|dictatorial]] authority, Astell argued that political subjects were never entitled to oppose the monarch.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Springborg |first=Patricia |date=1995 |title=Mary Astell (1666-1731), Critic of Locke |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2082978 |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=621–633 |doi=10.2307/2082978 |jstor=2082978 |s2cid=145088771 |issn=0003-0554}}</ref> Locke criticised Astell's views on natural law and the right of resistance in his [[Two Treatises of Government|First Treatise]], published in 1690.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sowaal |first=Alice |date=2017-12-21 |title=Mary Astell on Liberty |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198810261.003.0012 |journal=Oxford Scholarship Online |doi=10.1093/oso/9780198810261.003.0012}}</ref>

Astell maintains that while Locke considers [[self-preservation]] to be a fundamental right, it only involves preserving the immortal soul. Therefore, humans are only allowed to act in ways that will ensure the safety of their souls from judgment, in accordance with natural law.

==Legacy==

Astell's ideas about women in education laid the foundation for later feminist movements, as they challenged social norms and paved the way for improved educational opportunities for women. Her work continues to inspire contemporary debates on gender equality and the importance of education in women's empowerment. Mary Astell's groundbreaking reflections on women's education continue to be a testament to her enduring legacy as a feminist philosopher and advocate for women's rights.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kinnaird |first=Joan K. |date=1979 |title=Mary Astell and the Conservative Contribution to English Feminism |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/385747 |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=53–75 |doi=10.1086/385747 |s2cid=161848352 |issn=0021-9371}}</ref>

Astell had a significant personal library which was an unusual example of a late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century book collection owned by a woman who was herself a published author. Her books can be recognised by the inscription of her name on the title page and her many annotations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mary Astell 1666-1731 - Book Owners Online |url=https://www.bookowners.online/Mary_Astell_1666-1731 |access-date=2022-11-04 |website=www.bookowners.online}}</ref> In 2021 a collection of 47 of Astell's books and pamphlets, many of which have her annotations, were identified in the Old Library at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]] by Catherine Sutherland, the Deputy Librarian. These [[marginalia]] reveal, for the first time, the degree to which she was involved with the natural philosophy literature and discourse of her time. Other holdings are at the [[British Library]] and the [[Northamptonshire Record Office]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Swerling |first1=Gabriella |title=Handwritten notes reveal mind of 'the first English feminist' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/08/handwritten-notes-reveal-mind-first-english-feminist/ |access-date=11 March 2021 |work=Daily Telegraph |date=8 March 2021}}</ref>{{sfn|Almeroth-Williams|2021}}

The Mary Astell Academy (formerly Linhope [[Pupil Referral Unit|PRU]]) in Linhope Road, [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], is named after her.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Us |url=http://maryastellacademy.co.uk/about-us-2/ |website=Mary Astell Academy}}</ref> There is also a Mary-Astell-Straße in [[Bremen]], Germany.
