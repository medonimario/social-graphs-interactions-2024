Born in London, Turing was raised in [[southern England]]. He graduated from [[University of Cambridge|King's College, Cambridge]], and in 1938, earned a doctorate degree from [[Princeton University]]. During [[World War II]], Turing worked for the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]], Britain's [[codebreaking]] centre that produced [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]] intelligence. He led [[Hut 8]], the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Turing devised techniques for speeding the breaking of German [[cipher]]s, including improvements to the pre-war Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|bomba]] method, an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] machine that could find settings for the [[Enigma machine]]. He played a crucial role in cracking intercepted messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the [[Axis powers]] in many crucial engagements, including the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].<ref name="bbc-copeland">{{cite news|last=Copeland|first=Jack|author-link=Jack Copeland|date=18 June 2012|title=Alan Turing: The codebreaker who saved 'millions of lives'|publisher=BBC News Technology|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18419691|url-status=live|access-date=26 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011045451/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18419691|archive-date=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref>A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany.

After the war, Turing worked at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]], where he designed the [[Automatic Computing Engine]], one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined [[Max Newman]]'s [[Computing Machine Laboratory]] at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]], where he helped develop the [[Manchester computers]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=231–233}}</ref> and became interested in [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]].

Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the [[Official Secrets Act 1939|Official Secrets Act]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Olinick |first=Michael |year=2021 |title=Simply Turing |location=United States |publisher=Simply Charly |chapter=Chapter 15}}</ref>

In 1952, Turing was prosecuted for [[Gross indecency|homosexual acts]]. He accepted hormone treatment, a procedure commonly referred to as [[chemical castration]], as an alternative to prison. Turing died on 7 June 1954, aged 41, from [[cyanide poisoning]]. An inquest determined [[List of LGBT-related suicides|his death as suicide]], but the evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.<ref name = "Copeland" /> 
Following a campaign in 2009, British prime minister [[Gordon Brown]] made an [[#Government apology and pardon|official public apology]] for "the appalling way [Turing] was treated". [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] granted a pardon in 2013. The term "[[Alan Turing law]]" is used informally to refer to a 2017 law in the UK that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.<ref name="BBC-pardon">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37711518 |title='Alan Turing law': Thousands of gay men to be pardoned |date=20 October 2016 |access-date=20 October 2016 |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020125029/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37711518 |archive-date=20 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Turing left an [[Legacy of Alan Turing|extensive legacy]] in mathematics and computing which today is recognised more widely, with statues and [[List of things named after Alan Turing|many things named after him]], including an [[Turing Award|annual award]] for computing innovation. His portrait appears on the [[Bank of England £50 note]], first released on 23 June 2021 to coincide with his birthday.

Turing was born in [[Maida Vale]], London, while his father, Julius Mathison Turing, was on leave from his position with the [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS) of the [[British Raj|British Raj government]] at [[Chatrapur]], then in the [[Madras Presidency]] and presently in [[Odisha]] state, in [[India]].<ref name = "Hodges1983P5">{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/early.html |title=The Alan Turing Internet Scrapbook |publisher=[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]] |access-date=2 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614051614/http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/early.html |archive-date=14 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Turing's father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev.&nbsp;John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a [[baronet]]. Turing's mother, Julius's wife, was Ethel Sara Turing ({{nee|Stoney}}), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway|Madras Railways]]. The Stoneys were a [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] [[gentry]] family from both [[County Tipperary]] and [[County Longford]], while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in [[County Clare]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phil |last=Maguire |title=An Irishman's Diary |page=5 |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |date=23 June 2012}}</ref> Julius and Ethel married on 1 October 1907 at the Church of Ireland [[St Bartholomew's Church, Dublin|St. Bartholomew's Church]] on [[Clyde Road]] in [[Ballsbridge]], [[Dublin]].<ref>Irish Marriages 1845–1958 / Dublin South, Dublin, Ireland / Group Registration ID 1990366, SR District/Reg Area, Dublin South</ref>

Julius's work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the [[Bengal Army]]. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to [[Maida Vale]],<ref name="englishheritaget">{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.001002006005/chooseLetter/T |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903150218/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.001002006005/chooseLetter/T |archive-date=3 September 2009 |title=London Blue Plaques |access-date=10 February 2007 |work=English Heritage |url-status=live}}</ref> London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a [[blue plaque]] on the outside of the house of his birth,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.nature.com/london/2011/03/16/the-scientific-tourist-in-london-17-alan-turings-birth-place |title=The Scientific Tourist In London: #17 Alan Turing's Birth Place |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054045/http://blogs.nature.com/london/2011/03/16/the-scientific-tourist-in-london-17-alan-turings-birth-place |archive-date=21 September 2013 |website=Nature London Blog}},</ref><ref>{{openplaque|381}}</ref> later the [[Colonnade Hotel (London)|Colonnade Hotel]].<ref name="Hodges1983P5"/><ref name="turingorguk">{{cite web | url=http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/memorial.html | title=The Alan Turing Internet Scrapbook | access-date=26 September 2006 | archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110720214124/http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/memorial.html | archive-date=20 July 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref> Turing had an elder brother, John Ferrier Turing, father of [[Dermot Turing|Sir John Dermot Turing]], 12th Baronet of the [[Turing baronets]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bletchleypark.org.uk/about-us/bletchley-park-trustees/sir-john-dermot-turing |title=Sir John Dermot Turing |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018191443/https://bletchleypark.org.uk/about-us/bletchley-park-trustees/sir-john-dermot-turing |archive-date=18 October 2017 |website=Bletchley Park}}</ref>

Turing's father's civil service commission was still active during Turing's childhood years, and his parents travelled between [[Hastings]] in the United Kingdom<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=6}}</ref> and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired [[British Army|Army]] couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at [[Baston Lodge]], Upper Maze Hill, [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], now marked with a blue plaque.<ref name="Hastings & St. Leonards Observer - 29 June 2012 - Plaque unveiled at Turing's home in St Leonards">{{cite news|url=http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/news/plaque-unveiled-at-turing-s-home-in-st-leonards-1-4003535|title=Plaque unveiled at Turing's home in St Leonards|date=29 June 2012|work=[[Hastings & St. Leonards Observer]]|access-date=3 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912121655/http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/news/plaque-unveiled-at-turing-s-home-in-st-leonards-1-4003535|archive-date=12 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's birth.<ref name="BBC News - 25 June 2012 - St Leonards plaque marks Alan Turing's early years">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-18580826|title=St Leonards plaque marks Alan Turing's early years|date=25 June 2012|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=3 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203074933/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-18580826|archive-date=3 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Very early in life, Turing's parents purchased a house in [[Guildford]] in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guildford-dragon.com/2012/11/29/founder-of-computer-science-alan-turings-guildford-stargazing/ |title=Guildford Dragon NEWS |publisher=The Guildford Dragon |date=29 November 2012 |access-date=31 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019062927/http://www.guildford-dragon.com/2012/11/29/founder-of-computer-science-alan-turings-guildford-stargazing/ |archive-date=19 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===School===
Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a primary school at 20 Charles Road, [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], from the age of six to nine. The headmistress recognised his talent, noting that she "...had clever boys and hardworking boys, but Alan is a genius".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cawthorne|first=Nigel|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/890938716|title=Alan Turing : the enigma man|date=2014|isbn=978-1-78404-535-7|location=London|publisher=Arcturus Publishing|pages=18|oclc=890938716|access-date=26 August 2024|archive-date=17 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211117213134/https://www.worldcat.org/title/alan-turing-the-enigma-man/oclc/890938716|url-status=live}}</ref>

Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of [[Frant]] in Sussex (now [[East Sussex]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldshirburnian.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TURING-Alan-Mathison.pdf|title=Alan Turing Archive – Sherborne School (ARCHON CODE: GB1949)|author=Alan Mathison|work=Sherborne School, Dorset|date=April 2016|access-date=5 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226093015/http://oldshirburnian.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TURING-Alan-Mathison.pdf|archive-date=26 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to [[Sherborne School]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=1 September 2016|title=Alan Turing OBE, PhD, FRS (1912–1954)|url=https://oldshirburnian.org.uk/alan-turing/|access-date=10 October 2020|website=The Old Shirburnian Society|language=en-GB|archive-date=4 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201104133822/https://oldshirburnian.org.uk/alan-turing/|url-status=live}}</ref> an independent boarding school in the market town of [[Sherborne]] in Dorset, where he boarded at Westcott House. The first day of term coincided with the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]], in Britain, but Turing was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied {{convert|60|mi|km}} from [[Southampton]] to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.<ref name=metamagical>{{Cite book|title=Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=o8jzWF7rD6oC&pg=PA484 484]|first=Douglas R. |last=Hofstadter |year=1985 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-04566-2 |oclc=230812136}}</ref>

Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose [[definition of education]] placed more emphasis on the [[classics]]. His headmaster wrote to his parents: "I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming ''educated''. If he is to be solely a ''Scientific Specialist'', he is wasting his time at a public school".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=26}}</ref> Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary [[calculus]]. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered [[Albert Einstein]]'s work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of [[Newton's laws of motion]] from a text in which this was never made explicit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=34}}</ref>

At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Collan Morcom (13 July 1911 – 13 February 1930),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oldshirburnian.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Obituary-for-Christopher-Morcom-The-Shirburnian-March-1930.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://oldshirburnian.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Obituary-for-Christopher-Morcom-The-Shirburnian-March-1930.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live|title=''The Shirburnian''}}</ref> who has been described as Turing's first love.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Alyson Almanac: A Treasury of Information for the Gay and Lesbian Community |date=1989 |publisher=Alyson Publications |isbn=978-0-932870-19-3 |page=192 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-8gAQAAMAAJ |language=en |quote=After his first love, Christopher Morcom, died of tuberculosis ... |access-date=26 August 2024 |archive-date=7 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231107005431/https://books.google.com/books?id=v-8gAQAAMAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Hodges |first1=Andrew |title=Alan Turing: The Enigma |date=1992 |publisher=Vintage |isbn=978-0-09-911641-7 |page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWvPIWm75XIC |quote=This was first love, which Alan would himself come to regard as the first of many for others of his own sex. |access-date=26 August 2024 |archive-date=8 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230908030210/https://books.google.com/books?id=VWvPIWm75XIC |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Tekhnema: Journal of Philosophy and Technology |date=1995 |publisher=American University of Paris |page=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wkvGAAAAIAAJ |quote=...

The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother, Frances Isobel Morcom (née Swan), Turing wrote:

{{blockquote|I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me&nbsp;... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=61}}</ref>}}

Turing's relationship with Morcom's mother continued long after Morcom's death, with her sending gifts to Turing, and him sending letters, typically on Morcom's birthday.<ref name=":1">{{cite book |title=Alan Turing: The Enigma |publisher=Princeton University Press |author-link=Andrew Hodges |last=Hodges |first=Andrew |page=[https://archive.org/details/alanturingenigma0000hodg/page/87 87] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-691-15564-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/alanturingenigma0000hodg|url-access=registration }}</ref> A day before the third anniversary of Morcom's death (13 February 1933), he wrote to Mrs. Morcom:

{{blockquote|I expect you will be thinking of Chris when this reaches you. I shall too, and this letter is just to tell you that I shall be thinking of Chris and of you tomorrow.

Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's [[atheism]] and [[materialism]].<ref>{{Cite web |first=Paul |last=Gray |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990624,00.html |title=Alan Turing |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119181237/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990624,00.html |archive-date=19 January 2011 |work=Time Magazine's Most Important People of the Century |page=2}}</ref> Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing wrote:

{{blockquote|Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body&nbsp;... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=82–83}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oldshirburnian.org.uk/alan-turing-and-the-nature-of-spirit/|title=Alan Turing and the 'Nature of Spirit'|website=oldshirburnian.org.uk|date=15 August 2020|access-date=26 August 2024|archive-date=20 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220185715/http://oldshirburnian.org.uk/alan-turing-and-the-nature-of-spirit/|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

===University and work on computability===
After graduating from Sherborne, Turing applied for several Cambridge colleges scholarships, including [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]] and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]], eventually earning an £80 per annum scholarship (equivalent to about £4,300 as of 2023) to study at the latter.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hodges |first1=Andrew |title=Alan Turing: The Enigma |date=10 November 2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-16472-4 |pages=74–5 |edition=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator | title=Inflation calculator | access-date=26 August 2024 | archive-date=5 October 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005211045/https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator | url-status=live }}</ref> There, Turing studied the undergraduate course in Schedule B (that is, a three-year Parts I and II, of the [[Mathematical Tripos]], with extra courses at the end of the third year, as Part III only emerged as a separate degree in 1934) from February 1931 to November 1934 at [[King's College, Cambridge]], where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. His dissertation, ''On the Gaussian error function'', written during his senior year and delivered in November 1934 (with a deadline date of 6 December) proved a version of the [[central limit theorem]]. It was finally accepted on 16 March 1935. By spring of that same year, Turing started his master's course (Part III)—which he completed in 1937—and, at the same time, he published his first paper, a one-page article called ''Equivalence of left and right almost periodicity'' (sent on 23 April), featured in the tenth volume of the ''[[London Mathematical Society|Journal of the London Mathematical Society]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://turingarchive.kings.cam.ac.uk/publications-lectures-and-talks-amtb/amt-b-10 | title=AMT-B-10 &#124; the Turing Digital Archive }}</ref> Later that year, Turing was elected a [[Fellow]] of King's College on the strength of his dissertation<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Aldrich |first=John |date=December 2009 |title=England and Continental Probability in the Inter-War Years |journal=Electronic Journ@l for History of Probability and Statistics |volume=5 |number=2 |url=https://www.jehps.net/Decembre2009/Aldrich.pdf |pages=7–11}}</ref> where he served as a [[lecturer]].<ref name=lecturer>{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Turing|year=1939|url=https://archivesearch.lib.cam.ac.uk/repositories/7/archival_objects/272543|website=cam.ac.uk|title=Letter From Alan Turing to his mother, Sara Turing, 1939-01-23|quote=“My lectures are going off rather well.

No doubt the attendance will drop off as the term advances.”}}</ref> However, and, unknown to Turing, this version of the theorem he proved in his paper, had already been proven, in 1922, by [[Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg]]. Despite this, the committee found Turing's methods original and so regarded the work worthy of consideration for the fellowship. [[Abram Besicovitch]]'s report for the committee went so far as to say that if Turing's work had been published before Lindeberg's, it would have been "an important event in the mathematical literature of that year".<ref>{{cite book |last=Turing |first=Dermot |author-link=Dermot Turing |title=[[Prof: Alan Turing Decoded]] |year=2015 |publisher=[[The History Press]] |isbn=9781841656434 |page= 69}}</ref>{{sfn|Hodges|1983|p=113}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=Alan Turing and the Central Limit Theorem |first=S.

Between the springs of 1935 and 1936, at the same time as Church, Turing worked on the decidability of problems, starting from [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]. In mid-April 1936, Turing sent Max Newman the first draft typescript of his investigations. That same month, Alonzo Church published his ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'', with similar conclusions to Turing's then-yet unpublished work. Finally, on 28 May of that year, he finished and delivered his 36-page paper for publication called "[[On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]]".<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}</ref> It was published in the ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'' journal in two parts, the first on 30 November and the second on 23 December.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlsJuSj2OkEC&pg=PA211 |page=211 |title=Computability: Turing, Gödel, Church, and Beyond |author1=B.

Posy |author3=Oron Shagrir |publisher=MIT Press |year=2013|isbn=978-0-262-01899-9 }}</ref> In this paper, Turing reformulated [[Kurt Gödel]]'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as [[Turing machine]]s. The ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Turing proved that his "universal computing machine" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''decision problem'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. This paper has been called "easily the most influential math paper in history".<ref>{{cite book |page=15 |title=Mathematics and Computation |author=Avi Wigderson |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2019|isbn=978-0-691-18913-0 }}</ref>

Although [[Turing's proof]] was published shortly after [[Alonzo Church]]'s equivalent proof using his [[lambda calculus]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Church|1936}}</ref> Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grime|first1=James|title=What Did Turing Do for Us?|url=https://nrich.maths.org/8050|website=[[NRICH]]|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|access-date=28 February 2016|date=February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304175703/http://nrich.maths.org/8050|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus).

[[John von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.<ref>"von Neumann&nbsp;... firmly emphasised to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing—insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others."

From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at [[Princeton University]],<ref name="bowen19" /> in the second year as a [[Jane Eliza Procter Fellowship|Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow]]. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical [[binary multiplier]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=138}}</ref> In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from the [[Princeton University Department of Mathematics|Department of Mathematics]] at Princeton;<ref>{{Cite journal

==Career and research==
When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] about the [[foundations of mathematics]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=152}}</ref> The lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students' notes.<ref>{{Cite book |editor-first=Cora |editor-last=Diamond |editor-link=Cora Diamond |title=Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1976}}</ref> Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending [[Philosophy of mathematics#Formalism|formalism]] and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=153–154}}</ref>

===Cryptanalysis===
During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at [[Bletchley Park]]. The historian and wartime codebreaker [[Asa Briggs]] has said, "You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius."<ref>{{Cite AV media | last = Briggs | first = Asa | author-link = Asa Briggs | title = Britain's Greatest Codebreaker | type = TV broadcast | publisher = [[Channel 4|UK Channel 4]] | date = 21 November 2011}}</ref>

From September 1938, Turing worked part-time with the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on [[cryptanalysis of the Enigma|cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine]] used by [[Nazi Germany]], together with [[Dilly Knox]], a senior GC&CS codebreaker.<ref>{{Cite book | author-link = Jack Copeland | last = Copeland | first = Jack | chapter = Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age | page = 352 | title = Action This Day | publisher = Bantam | date = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-593-04910-5 | editor1-first = Michael | editor1-last = Smith | editor2-first = Ralph | editor2-last = Erskine }}</ref> Soon after the July 1939 meeting near [[Warsaw]] at which the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]] gave the British and French details of the wiring of [[Enigma rotor details|Enigma machine's rotors]] and their method of decrypting [[Enigma machine]]'s messages, Turing and Knox developed a broader solution.<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004a|p=217}}</ref> The Polish method relied on an insecure [[Cryptanalysis#Indicator|indicator]] procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they in fact did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more general, using [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Crib-based decryption|crib-based decryption]] for which he produced the functional specification of the [[bombe]] (an improvement on the Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|Bomba]]).<ref>{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Liat |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all |title=Turing's achievements: codebreaking, AI and the birth of computer science (Wired UK) |magazine=Wired |date=18 June 2012 |access-date=31 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102122933/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all |archive-date=2 November 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure dubbed ''[[Banburismus]]'' for making much more efficient use of the bombes; developing a procedure dubbed ''[[Turingery]]'' for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the [[Lorenz SZ 40/42]] (''Tunny'') cipher machine and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable [[secure voice]] scrambler at [[Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre|Hanslope Park]] that was codenamed ''Delilah''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How Alan Turing Cracked The Enigma Code |url=https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-alan-turing-cracked-the-enigma-code |access-date=12 July 2023 |website=Imperial War Museums |language=en |archive-date=24 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220124140731/https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-alan-turing-cracked-the-enigma-code |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Turing |first1=Alan M. |last2=Bayley |first2=D. |date=2012 |title=Report on Speech Secrecy System DELILAH, a Technical Description Compiled by A.

Turing had a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as "Prof" and his treatise on Enigma was known as the "Prof's Book".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=208}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Prof's Book: Turing's Treatise on the Enigma |first=Alan M. |last=Turing |year=1940 |url=https://archive.org/details/hw-25-3/ |url-access=registration |quote=In late 1940 Alan Turing wrote a report describing the methods he and his colleagues at Bletchley Park had used to break into the German Enigma cipher systems.

Subsequently, a much better original copy was released by the (British) National Archives, box HW 25/3. This also revealed a title which had been lost in the American copy: ''Mathematical theory of ENIGMA machine''. (Though, oddly, the report does not actually have any mathematical theory.)}}</ref> According to historian [[Ronald Lewin]], [[I.J. Good|Jack Good]], a cryptanalyst who worked with Turing, said of his colleague:

{{blockquote|In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand. Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewin|1978|p=57}}</ref>}}

[[Peter Hilton]] recounted his experience working with Turing in [[Hut 8]] in his "Reminiscences of Bletchley Park" from ''A Century of Mathematics in America:''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/math-history/hmath1-hilton22.pdf|title=A Century of Mathematics in America, Part 1, Reminiscences of Bletchley Park|last=Hilton|first=Peter|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829112241/http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/math-history/hmath1-hilton22.pdf|archive-date=29 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{blockquote| It is a rare experience to meet an authentic genius. Those of us privileged to inhabit the world of scholarship are familiar with the intellectual stimulation furnished by talented colleagues. We can admire the ideas they share with us and are usually able to understand their source; we may even often believe that we ourselves could have created such concepts and originated such thoughts. However, the experience of sharing the intellectual life of a genius is entirely different; one realizes that one is in the presence of an intelligence, a sensibility of such profundity and originality that one is filled with wonder and excitement.
Alan Turing was such a genius, and those, like myself, who had the astonishing and unexpected opportunity, created by the strange exigencies of the Second World War, to be able to count Turing as colleague and friend will never forget that experience, nor can we ever lose its immense benefit to us.|sign=|source=}}

===Bombe===
Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,<ref name="Copeland2006p378" /> Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the [[bombe]], which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish ''[[bomba (cryptography)|bomba kryptologiczna]]'', from which its name was derived. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]], became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Welchman |first= Gordon |author-link= Gordon Welchman |orig-year= 1982 |year= 1997 |title= The Hut Six story: Breaking the Enigma codes |page= 81 |location= Cleobury Mortimer, England |publisher= M&M Baldwin |isbn= 978-0-947712-34-1 }}</ref>

[[File:Bombe-rebuild.jpg|thumbnail|right|A working replica of a [[bombe]] now at [[The National Museum of Computing]] on Bletchley Park]]The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings) using a suitable ''[[crib (cryptanalysis)|crib]]'': a fragment of probable [[plaintext]]. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 10<sup>19</sup> states, or 10<sup>22</sup> states for the four-rotor U-boat variant),<ref>Jack Good in "The Men Who Cracked Enigma", 2003: with his caveat: "if my memory is correct".</ref> the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented [[Electromechanics|electromechanically]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tnmoc.org/bombe |title=The Turing-Welchman Bombe |website=The National Museum of Computing |access-date=18 March 2021 |archive-date=24 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220124200142/https://www.tnmoc.org/bombe |url-status=live }}</ref>

The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter, which was impossible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oakley|2006|p=40/03B}}</ref>

==== Action This Day ====
{{main|Action This Day (memo)}}

By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts [[Gordon Welchman]], [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]] were frustrated. Building on the [[Biuro Szyfrów#Gift to allies|work of the Poles]], they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals. In the summer, they had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month; however, they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but had failed.<ref name=":0" />

On 28 October they wrote directly to [[Winston Churchill]] explaining their difficulties, with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.<ref name=":0">{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=218}}</ref> As [[Andrew Hodges]], biographer of Turing, later wrote, "This letter had an electric effect."<ref name="Hodges 1983 221">{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=221}}</ref> Churchill wrote a memo to [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|General Ismay]], which read: "ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done." On 18 November, the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken.<ref name="Hodges 1983 221"/> The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister's response, but as Milner-Barry recalled, "All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth."<ref>Copeland, ''The Essential Turing'', [http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/turingletter.pdf pp. 336–337] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218142127/http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/turingletter.pdf |date=18 February 2015 }}.</ref> More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.<ref name=codebreaker>{{cite web | last1 = Copeland | first1 = Jack | last2 = Proudfoot | first2 = Diane | author-link = Jack Copeland | title = Alan Turing, Codebreaker and Computer Pioneer | url = http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/codebreaker.html | publisher = alanturing.net | date = May 2004 | access-date = 27 July 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070709065520/http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/codebreaker.html | archive-date = 9 July 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Hut 8 and the naval Enigma===

Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of cracking the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German Naval Enigma|German naval use of Enigma]] "because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself".<ref name=MahonP14>{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=14}}</ref> In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]] system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.<ref name=MahonP14 /><ref>{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=184–186}}</ref>

That same night, he also conceived of the idea of ''[[Banburismus]]'', a sequential statistical technique (what [[Abraham Wald]] later called [[sequential analysis]]) to assist in breaking the naval Enigma, "though I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not, in fact, sure until some days had actually broken".<ref name=MahonP14 /> For this, he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ''[[Ban (unit)|ban]]''. ''Banburismus'' could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gladwin|first=Lee|date=Fall 1997|title=Alan Turing, Enigma, and the Breaking of German Machine Ciphers in World War II|url=https://www.archives.gov/files/publications/prologue/1997/fall/turing.pdf|journal=Prologue Magazine|volume=Fall 1997|pages=202–217|via=National Archives|access-date=13 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626211657/https://www.archives.gov/files/publications/prologue/1997/fall/turing.pdf|archive-date=26 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Later this sequential process of accumulating sufficient weight of evidence using decibans (one tenth of a ban) was used in [[cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher]].<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Good | first1 = Jack | author-link = I.

Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=242–245}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Alan Turing's Report from Washington, 1942 |url=https://www.turing.org.uk/sources/washington.html |access-date=12 July 2023 |website=www.turing.org.uk |archive-date=12 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230712083844/https://www.turing.org.uk/sources/washington.html |url-status=live }}</ref> He also visited their [[United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory|Computing Machine Laboratory]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Alan Turing's Dayton Report, 1942 |url=https://www.turing.org.uk/sources/dayton123.html |access-date=12 July 2023 |website=www.turing.org.uk}}</ref>

Turing's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:

{{blockquote|text=The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme, but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way.

Their test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Turing |first=Alan M. |year=2001 |journal=Cryptologia |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1080/0161-110191889734 |title=Visit to National Cash Register Corporation of Dayton, Ohio |s2cid=14207094 }}</ref>|source=}}

During this trip, he also assisted at [[Bell Labs]] with the development of [[secure speech]] devices.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=245–253}}</ref> He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, [[Colonel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been ''de facto'' head for some time (Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section). Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marshallfoundation.org/newsroom/marshall-legacy-series/codebreaking/|title=Marshall Legacy Series: Codebreaking – Events|website=marshallfoundation.org|access-date=7 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407030638/https://www.marshallfoundation.org/newsroom/marshall-legacy-series/codebreaking/|archive-date=7 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Alexander wrote of Turing's contribution:

{{blockquote|There should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the biggest factor in Hut 8's success. In the early days, he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut, but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is 'absolutely indispensable', but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing. The pioneer's work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing's contribution was never fully realised by the outside world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alexander|circa 1945|p=42}}</ref>}}

===Turingery===
In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed ''[[Turingery]]'' (or jokingly ''Turingismus<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=380}}</ref>'') for use against the [[Lorenz cipher]] messages produced by the Germans' new ''Geheimschreiber'' (secret writer) machine. This was a [[teleprinter]] [[Rotor machine|rotor cipher attachment]] codenamed ''Tunny'' at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of ''wheel-breaking'', i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels.<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=381}}</ref> He also introduced the Tunny team to [[Tommy Flowers]] who, under the guidance of [[Max Newman]], went on to build the [[Colossus computer]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]]), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=72}}</ref> Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about [[cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Gannon|2007|p=230}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hilton|2006|pp=197–199}}</ref> but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|pp=382, 383}}</ref>

===Delilah===
Following his work at [[Bell Labs]] in the US,<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=245–250}}</ref> Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system. In the latter part of the war, he moved to work for the Secret Service's Radio Security Service (later [[Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre|HMGCC]]) at [[Hanslope Park]].<ref>{{cite journal| last = Harper| first = John| author-link = John Harper (computer engineer)| title = Delilah Voice Secrecy System| journal = Resurrection: The Journal of the Computer Conservation Society| issue = 101| pages = 8–9| publisher = The Computer Conservation Society| date = Spring 2023| url = https://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection/res101.htm#d| access-date = 28 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last = Harper| first = John| author-link = John Harper (computer engineer)| title = Delilah Voice Secrecy System [part 2]: The Design, Development and Commissioning of Delilah in 1943 – 1945| journal = Resurrection: The Journal of the Computer Conservation Society| issue = 102| pages = 16–19| publisher = The Computer Conservation Society| date = Summer 2023| url = https://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection/res102.htm#c| access-date = 28 June 2023| archive-date = 3 July 2023| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230703233634/https://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection/res102.htm#c| url-status = live}}</ref> At the park, he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers|REME]] officer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable [[secure voice]] communications machine codenamed ''[[Delilah (voice encryption)|Delilah]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=273}}</ref> The machine was intended for different applications, but it lacked the capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions. In any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully, with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a [[Winston Churchill]] speech, Delilah was not adopted for use.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=346}}</ref> Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of [[SIGSALY]], a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war.

===Early computers and the Turing test===

According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer [[Heinz Billing]] from the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]], published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Turing and [[Konrad Zuse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/Images/Turing_Zuse.pdf|title=Did Alan Turing interrogate Konrad Zuse in Göttingen in 1947?|author=Bruderer, Herbert|access-date=7 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521211106/http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/Images/Turing_Zuse.pdf|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> It took place in [[Göttingen]] in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing (for more details see Herbert Bruderer, ''Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz'').

In 1948, Turing was appointed [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Mathematics Department]] at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]]. A year later, he became deputy director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest [[Von Neumann architecture|stored-program]] computers—the [[Manchester Mark 1]]. Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer's Manual for this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.manturing.net/|title=Alan Turing's Manchester|last=Swinton|first=Jonathan|publisher=Infang Publishing|year=2019|isbn=978-0-9931789-2-4|location=Manchester|access-date=18 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217172318/https://www.manturing.net/|archive-date=17 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> During this time, he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics,<ref name="doi10.1093/qjmam/1.1.287">{{Cite journal|last1 = Turing |first1 = A.M.|doi = 10.1093/qjmam/1.1.287 |title = Rounding-Off Errors in Matrix Processes |journal = The Quarterly Journal of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics |volume = 1| pages = 287–308 |year = 1948| issue=1 |hdl = 10338.dmlcz/103139|doi-access = free }}</ref> and in "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]" (''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of [[artificial intelligence]], and proposed an experiment that became known as the [[Turing test]], an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent".

In 1948, Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, [[D.G. Champernowne]], began writing a [[chess]] program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the [[Turochamp]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Clark|first=Liat|title=Turing's achievements: codebreaking, AI and the birth of computer science|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all|magazine=Wired|access-date=11 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102122933/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all|archive-date=2 November 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1952, he tried to implement it on a [[Ferranti Mark 1]], but lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute the program.

===Pattern formation and mathematical biology===

When Turing was 39 years old in 1951, he turned to [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]], finally publishing his masterpiece "[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]" in January 1952. He was interested in [[morphogenesis]], the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a [[reaction–diffusion system]], could account for "the main phenomena of morphogenesis".<ref>{{cite journal | first=Alan M. | last=Turing | author-link=Alan Turing | title=The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B | date=14 August 1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | volume=237 | number=641 | pages=37–72 | bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T | s2cid=120437796 }}</ref> He used systems of [[partial differential equations]] to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is [[autocatalytic]], and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand. These calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist [[Boris Pavlovich Belousov|Boris Belousov]] had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Belousov was not aware of Turing's paper in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |first=John |last=Gribbin |title=Deep Simplicity |page=126 |publisher=Random House |year=2004}}</ref>

Although published before the structure and role of [[DNA]] was understood, Turing's work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swintons.net/deodands/archives/000087.html |title=Turing's Last, Lost work |access-date=28 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030823032620/http://www.swintons.net/deodands/archives/000087.html |archive-date=23 August 2003 }}</ref> One of the early applications of Turing's paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats, large and small.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Murray | first=James D. | title=How the Leopard Gets Its Spots | journal=Scientific American  | volume=258 | issue=3 | date=March 1988 | jstor=24989019 | pages=80–87 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0388-80 | bibcode=1988SciAm.258c..80M }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |first=James D. |last=Murray |title=Mathematical Biology I |year=2007 |chapter=Chapter 6 |publisher=Springer Verlag}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |first=John |last=Gribbin |title=Deep Simplicity |page=134 |publisher=Random House |year=2004}}</ref> Further research in the area suggests that Turing's work can partially explain the growth of "feathers, hair follicles, the branching pattern of lungs, and even the left-right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest".<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.338.6113.1406|pmid=23239707|title=Turing Pattern Fingered for Digit Formation|journal=Science|volume=338|issue=6113|pages=1406|year=2012|last1=Vogel|first1=G.|bibcode=2012Sci...338.1406V}}</ref> In 2012, Sheth, et al. found that in mice, removal of [[Hox genes]] causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing-type mechanism.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1 = Sheth |first1 = R. |last2 = Marcon |first2 = L. |last3 = Bastida |first3 = M.F. |last4 = Junco |first4 = M. |last5 = Quintana |first5 = L. |last6 = Dahn |first6 = R. |last7 = Kmita |first7 = M. |last8 = Sharpe |first8 = J. |last9 = Ros |first9 = M.A. |doi = 10.1126/science.1226804 |title = Hox Genes Regulate Digit Patterning by Controlling the Wavelength of a Turing-Type Mechanism |journal = Science |volume = 338 |issue = 6113 |pages = 1476–1480 |year = 2012 |pmid = 23239739 |pmc = 4486416 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338.1476S }}</ref> Later papers were not available until ''Collected Works of A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Turing'' was published in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Alan Turing Bibliography|url=http://www.turing.org.uk/sources/biblio3.html|page=morphogenesis|publisher=turing.org.uk|access-date=27 July 2015|author=Andrew Hodges|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905180420/http://www.turing.org.uk/sources/biblio3.html|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

A study conducted in 2023 confirmed Turing's mathematical model hypothesis. Presented by the [[American Physical Society]], the experiment involved growing [[chia seed]]s in even layers within trays, later adjusting the available moisture. Researchers experimentally tweaked the factors which appear in the Turing equations, and, as a result, patterns resembling those seen in natural environments emerged. This is believed to be the first time that experiments with living vegetation have verified Turing's mathematical insight.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seeds-alan-turing-patterns-nature-math|author=James R.

==Personal life==
===Treasure===
In the 1940s, Turing became worried about losing his savings in the event of a German invasion. In order to protect it, he bought two [[Silver as an investment|silver bars]] weighing {{cvt|3200|oz|kg|-1}} and worth £250 (in 2022, £8,000 adjusted for inflation, £48,000 at spot price) and buried them in a wood near Bletchley Park.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Myrberg Burström |first=Nanouschka |url=https://www.academia.edu/13683478 |title=A tale of buried treasure, some good estimations, and golden unicorns: The numismatic connections of Alan Turing |publisher=Svenska Numismatiska Föreningen |year=2015 |isbn=9789197942720 |location=Stockholm |pages=226–230 |language=en |access-date=26 August 2024 |archive-date=2 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240702161450/https://www.academia.edu/13683478 |url-status=live }}</ref> Upon returning to dig them up, Turing found that he was unable to break his own code describing where exactly he had hidden them.

===Engagement===
In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague [[Joan Clarke]], a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly "unfazed" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=176–178}}</ref>

===Homosexuality and indecency conviction===
In December 1951, Turing met Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing was walking along Manchester's [[Wilmslow Road|Oxford Road]] when he met Murray just outside the [[Dancehouse|Regal Cinema]] and invited him to lunch. The two agreed to meet again and in January 1952 began an intimate relationship.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Alan Turing |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/Alan_Turing.htm |access-date=22 July 2023 |website=Spartacus Educational |language=en |archive-date=25 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211125054932/https://spartacus-educational.com/Alan_Turing.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>  On 23 January, Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=458}}</ref> and both men were charged with "[[gross indecency]]" under [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885#Section 11|Section 11]] of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]].<ref name="LeavittP268">{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=268}}</ref> Initial [[committal procedure|committal proceedings]] for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor "reserved his defence", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations.

Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), the British [[signals intelligence]] agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic job. His trial took place only months after the defection to the Soviet Union of [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] in summer 1951 after which the Foreign Office started to consider anyone known to be homosexual as a potential security risk.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/revealed-the-panic-that-followed-the-defection-of-the-cambridge-spies-49623|title=The Panic that followed the defection of the Cambridge spies|website=The Conversation|date=23 October 2015|access-date=12 August 2023|archive-date=13 August 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230813085159/https://theconversation.com/revealed-the-panic-that-followed-the-defection-of-the-cambridge-spies-49623|url-status=live}}</ref>

Turing was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=143}}</ref> In the summer of 1952 he visited Norway which was more tolerant of homosexuals.

Philosopher [[Jack Copeland]] has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict. He suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death: the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to [[electroplating|electroplate]] gold onto spoons. The [[potassium cyanide]] was used to [[Gold#Chemistry|dissolve the gold]]. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed, and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded half-eaten.<ref name = "Copeland">{{cite news | first = Roland | last = Pease | title = Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable' | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 23 June 2012 | access-date = 23 June 2012 | quote = We have&nbsp;... been recreating the narrative of Turing's life, and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

Turing's biographer [[Andrew Hodges]] theorised that Turing deliberately left the nature of his death ambiguous in order to shield his mother from the knowledge that he had killed himself.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=488, 489}}</ref> Doubts on the suicide thesis have been also cast by [[John W. Dawson Jr.]] who, in his review of Hodges' book, recalls "Turing's vulnerable position in the Cold War political climate" and points out that "Turing was found dead by a maid, who discovered him 'lying neatly in his bed'—hardly what one would expect of "a man fighting for life against the suffocation induced by cyanide poisoning." Turing had given no hint of suicidal inclinations to his friends and had made no effort to put his affairs in order.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Dawson Jr. |first=John W. |author-link=John W. Dawson Jr. |title="Review of Andrew Hodges. Alan Turing: the enigma" |journal=[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |date=December 1985 |pages=1065–1067 |doi=10.2307/2273992 |jstor=2273992 |url=https://doi.org/10.2307/2273992}}</ref>

Hodges and a later biographer, [[David Leavitt]], have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), his favourite fairy tale. Both men noted that (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew".<ref>{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=140}} and {{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=149, 489}}</ref>
[[File:Alan Turing OBE.jpg|thumb|Turing's OBE currently held in [[Sherborne School]] archives]]

It has also been suggested that Turing's belief in [[fortune-telling]] may have caused his depressed mood.<ref name="hodges2012" /> As a youth, Turing had been told by a fortune-teller that he would be a genius. In mid-May 1954, shortly before his death, Turing again decided to consult a fortune-teller during a day-trip to [[Lytham St Annes|St Annes-on-Sea]] with the Greenbaum family.<ref name="hodges2012"/> According to the Greenbaums' daughter, Barbara:<ref name="dowd">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27701207 |title=What was Alan Turing really like? |author=Vincent Dowd |publisher=BBC |date=6 June 2014 |access-date=16 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117020715/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27701207 |archive-date=17 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{blockquote|But it was a lovely sunny day and Alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went&nbsp;... Then he thought it would be a good idea to go to the [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach|Pleasure Beach at Blackpool]]. We found a fortune-teller's tent and Alan said he'd like to go in[,] so we waited around for him to come back&nbsp;... And this sunny, cheerful visage had shrunk into a pale, shaking, horror-stricken face. Something had happened. We don't know what the fortune-teller said but he obviously was deeply unhappy. I think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide.}}

It was published in 1959, and so could not cover his war work. Scarcely 300 copies were sold (Sara Turing to Lyn Newman, 1967, Library of [[St John's College, Cambridge]]). The six-page foreword by [[Lyn Irvine]] includes reminiscences and is more frequently quoted. It was re-published by Cambridge University Press in 2012, to honour the centenary of his birth, and included a new foreword by [[Martin Davis (mathematician)|Martin Davis]], as well as a never-before-published memoir by Turing's older brother John F. Turing.
