'''William of Conches''' ({{langx|la|Gulielmus de Conchis}}; {{langx|fr|Guillaume de Conches}}; {{c.|1090|1154}}), historically sometimes [[anglicization of names|anglicized]] as '''William Shelley''',{{sfnp|''DNB''|1900}} was a [[Medieval France|medieval]] [[Norman people|Norman]]-[[French people|French]] [[scholastic philosopher]] who sought to expand the bounds of [[Christian humanism]] by studying secular works of [[classical literature]] and fostering [[European science in the Middle Ages|empirical science]]. He was a prominent {{lang|fr|Chartrain}} (member of the [[School of Chartres]]). [[John of Salisbury]], a [[bishop of Chartres|bishop]] of [[diocese of Chartres|Chartres]] and former student of William's, refers to William as the most talented [[grammarian (Greco-Roman)|grammarian]] of the time, after his former teacher [[Bernard of Chartres]].

==Life==
[[File:Eglise Sainte-Foy (Conches-en-Ouche) 11.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Relief of William from his [[tombstone]], originally at St Germanus's Church ({{lang|fr|Église St-Germain}}) in [[Tilleul-Folenfant|Tilleul]] but now displayed at St Faith's Church ({{lang|fr|Église Ste-Foy}}) in [[Conches-en-Ouche]]]]

William was born around 1085{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=13}}{{ndash}}1090{{sfnp|Ramírez-Weaver|2009|p=1}} in a small village near [[Évreux]], [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]]. From his surname, that village is generally taken to have been [[Conches-en-Ouche|Conches]]{{sfnp|''Brit.''|2024}} although it was possibly nearby [[Tilleul-Folenfant|Tilleul]] instead, the location of his later grave.{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|pp=2-3}}{{efn|William's birth was placed in [[Cornwall]] by [[John Bale]] on the supposed authority of [[John Boston of Bury|John Boston]] of [[Bury St Edmunds Abbey]], although [[Mary Bateson (historian)|Mary Bateson]] and others have considered this implausible.{{sfnp|''DNB''|1900}}}} At the time, Normandy was still uneasily controlled by [[Norman Dynasty|Norman]] [[Kingdom of England|England]] in notional [[homage (medieval)|homage]] to [[Kingdom of France|France]]. William studied under [[Bernard of Chartres]] in [[Chartres]], [[County of Blois|Blois]], and became a leading member of the [[School of Chartres]], early [[Scholastics]]{{sfnp|''Brit.''|2024}} who formed part of the [[12th-century Renaissance]]. Less focused on [[Aristotle]] and [[medieval dialectic]] than [[Peter Abelard]] and his students at the [[University of Paris]], the Chartrians primarily aimed to reconcile [[Christian morality]] and [[Christian legend|legend]] with [[Platonic philosophy]], chiefly with reference to the [[Book of Genesis]] and [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.{{sfnp|Parra|1943|p=178}}

William began teaching around 1115{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=13}}{{ndash}}1120{{sfnp|''DNB''|1900}} and was primarily based in Paris and Chartres.{{sfnp|''Brit.''|2024}}{{efn|He has sometimes been identified as the "Guillaume de Conques" listed as born 1080 and died 1154 who figures in the list of faculty of the medical school of the [[University of Montpellier]], although this remains a minority opinion.{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=14}}}} He composed his {{lang|la|De Philosophia Mundi}} around the period 1125 to 1130.{{sfnp|Ramírez-Weaver|2009|p=8}} He taught [[John of Salisbury]] at Chartres in 1137 and 1138, and John later considered him the most accomplished grammarian of his time{{sfnp|''DNB''|1900}} or just after his master Bernard.{{efn|{{lang|la|... Willelmus de Conchis, grammaticus, post Bernardum Carnotensem, opulentissimus ...}}{{sfnp|Migne|1855|loc=[https://archive.org/details/patrologiaecurs145unkngoog/page/n434/mode/2up col. 832]}}}} John describes his method of teaching in detail, noting it followed Bernard and both followed [[Quintilian]]'s {{lang|la|[[Institutio Oratoria]]}}.{{sfnp|''DNB''|1900}} There were lectures on classical with questions on parsing, [[Latin scansion|scansion]], and composition. Students practiced writing [[Latin prose|prose]] and [[Latin poetry|poetry]] on classical models and undertook frequent discussion on set subjects with the aim of developing fluency and cultivating elegant diction.{{sfnp|''DNB''|1900}} [[William of St. Thierry]], who had previously encouraged [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] to prosecute Abelard, wrote another letter to the same cleric "on the errors of William of Conches" ({{lang|la|De Erroribus Guillelmi de Conchis}}) in 1141,{{sfnp|Ramírez-Weaver|2009|p=8}} complaining of the [[modalism|modalist]] view of the [[Holy Trinity|Trinity]] implicit in the {{lang|la|Philosophia}}.{{sfnp|Anderson|2016|p=169}} William had not explicitly upheld with [[Bernard Sylvestris]] that Plato's "[[anima mundi|world soul]]" ({{langx|la|anima mundi}}; {{lang-grc-gre|ψυχὴ τοῦ κόσμου}}, {{translit|grc|psychḕ toû kósmou}}) was essentially identical with the [[Holy Spirit]], but had discussed the idea as a possibly valid reading.{{sfnp|Adamson|2019|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hverDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 97]}} With Abelard's writings successfully condemned by Bernard at the [[1141 Council of Sens|Council of Sens]] for a litany of [[heresy in Catholicism|heresies]] the same year, William withdrew from public teaching.{{sfnp|''DNB''|1900}} William's exemption from prosecution alongside his production of more orthodox revisions of some of his previous works, his departure from public teaching, and the bitterness of some of his discussion of clerics in his later works is suggestive of a compromise worked out between Bernard and his friend the [[papal legate]] [[Geoffroy de Lèves]], who as bishop of Chartres would have overseen its affiliated school, but there is no explicit surviving record of such an arrangement.{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|pp=26–28}}

William then sought the patronage and protection of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey Plantagenet]], the learned and powerful [[count of Anjou|count]] of [[County of Anjou|Anjou]].{{sfnp|''DNB''|1900}} In 1143 or 1144, he became the personal tutor of Geoffrey's 9 to 11-year-old son Henry, later [[Henry II of England|King Henry{{nbsp}}II of England]]. He also tutored Henry's brothers in the period from 1146 to 1149{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=10}} and composed his {{lang|la|Dragmaticon}}, a revision of his {{lang|la|Philosophia}} in the form of a dialogue,{{sfnp|''DNB''|1900}} sometime between 1144 and 1149.{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=9}} He dedicated it to Geoffrey.{{sfnp|''DNB''|1900}} There are some hints in his works that he may have resumed teaching, possibly in Paris, during the 1150s but these are inconclusive.{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=33}}

He died in 1154{{sfnp|''Brit.''|2024}} or shortly afterward,{{sfnp|Ramírez-Weaver|2009|p=1}} probably at Paris or the environs of Évreux.{{sfnp|''DNB''|1900}} The funeral slab with his effigy has been moved from its original location at St Germanus's Church, Tilleul, to St Faith's Church in Conches.{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|pp=2-3}}

==Works==
The number and attribution of works by William of Conches has been a persistent problem of medieval bibliography,{{sfnp|Poole|1920|loc=[[:s:Illustrations of the History of Medieval Thought and Learning/Appendix VI|Appendix VI: Excursus on the Writings of William of Conches]]}} as has the inaccuracy of the many manuscripts and editions.{{sfnp|Jeauneau|1973|pp=23-24}}

It is now certain that William wrote two editions of the encyclopedic {{lang|la|De Philosophia Mundi}} ("On the Philosophy of the World"),{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=35}} although it was previously variously attributed to [[Venerable Bede|Bede]],{{sfnp|Migne|1850}} [[William of Hirsau]],{{sfnp|Petri|1531}} [[Honorius of Autun]],{{sfnp|Migne, ''Phil. Mundi''|1854}}{{sfnp|Poole|1920|loc=[[:s:Illustrations of the History of Medieval Thought and Learning/Appendix V|Appendix V: Excursus on a Supposed Anticipation of Saint Anselm]]}} and [[Hugh of St Victor]].{{sfnp|Ottaviano|1935}}{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|pp=39-41}} Likewise, he wrote one edition of the related dialogue {{lang|la|Dragmaticon}},{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=35}} whose neological name has been variously emended to {{lang|la|Dramaticon}} ("A Dramatization"){{sfnp|Poole|1920|loc=[[:s:Illustrations of the History of Medieval Thought and Learning/Appendix VI|Appendix VI: Excursus on the Writings of William of Conches]]}} and to {{lang|la|Pragmaticon Philosophiae}} ("The Business of Philosophy"){{sfnp|''Brit.''|2024}} although William himself understood his transliteration of {{translit|grc|dramatikón}} ({{lang|grc|δραματικόν}}) as meaning an interrogation ({{lang|la|interrogatio}}) or question-and-answer format.<ref>{{lang|la|Glosae super Priscianum}}, p. 10.</ref>{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=49}} The {{lang|la|Dragmaticon}} continues to be largely considered a bowdlerized or revised edition of the {{lang|la|Philosophia}}; however, from the 1980s, scholars have reconsidered this attitude, noting that only about 3{{ndash}}5% of the earlier work was removed against a rough doubling of content, with numerous additional Greek and Arabic sources.{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|pp=43-48}} A "lost" treatise {{lang|la|Magna de Naturis Philosophia}} ("The Great Philosophy of Nature"), considered his true masterwork by his early biographers and sometimes still attributed to him,{{sfnp|''Brit.''|2024}} was the product of an extensive series of mistakes based on a poor edition of [[Vincent of Beauvais]]'s ''[[Speculum Naturale|Mirror of Nature]]''{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|pp=35-36}} that began with an extract from William of Conches's work.{{sfnp|Poole|1920|loc=[[:s:Illustrations of the History of Medieval Thought and Learning/Appendix VI|Appendix VI: Excursus on the Writings of William of Conches]]}}

William is also credited with numerous glosses on classic texts. He wrote surviving overviews of commentaries on [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' ({{lang|la|Glosae super Boetium}})<ref>{{harvp|Jourdain|1862}}; {{harvp|Parent|1938}}; & {{harvp|Lodi|1999}}.</ref> and [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' ({{lang|la|Glosae super Platonem}});<ref>{{harvp|Cousin|1836}}; {{harvp|Migne, ''Comm. Tim.''|1854}}; {{harvp|Parent|1938}} & {{harvp|Jeauneau|1957|pp=88-100}}; {{harvp|Delhaye|1949|pp=95-96}}; {{harvp|Jeauneau|1965}}; {{harvp|Jeauneau|2006}}; {{harvp|Martello|2011}}; & {{harvp|Martello|2012}}.</ref> 2 editions of his own commentary on [[Priscian]]'s ''[[Institutiones Grammaticae|Institutes of Grammar]]'' ({{lang|la|Glosae super Priscianum}}); and one or two editions of commentary on [[Macrobius]]'s ''Commentary on the [[Dream of Scipio]]'' ({{lang|la|Glosae super Macrobium}}); his other works also mention now-lost commentaries on [[Martianus Capella]]'s ''[[De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii|On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury]]'' and on Boethius's ''[[De Institutione Musica|On Education in Music]]''.{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=35}} He was probably responsible for several surviving glosses of [[Juvenal]]'s [[Juvenal's Satires|''Satires'']] and is credited by some with a lost commentary on [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''.{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=35}} He is sometimes still credited as the author of {{lang|la|[[Moralium Dogma Philosophorum]]}} ("Philosophers' [[ethics|Moral Teachings]]"), the first medieval treatise on philosophical ethics,{{sfnp|''Brit.''|2024}} although this attribution is more suspect.{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=36}} The gloss of the [[Gospels]] ({{lang|la|Glosa super Evangelia}}) credited to him was either entirely spurious or a misattribution of content from [[William of Auvergne]].{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=36}}

William's generally credited works are marked by special attention to [[cosmology (metaphysics)|cosmology]] and [[psychology]] and were among the first works of medieval Christian philosophy to devote considerable attention to [[Islamic philosophy]] and [[Islamic science|science]], using the [[Latin language|Latin]] translations produced by [[Constantine the African]].{{sfnp|''Cath. Enc.''|1913}} They display the [[humanism]], [[Neoplatonism and Christianity|Platonism]], and affinity for the [[natural sciences]] of other members of the School of Chartres,{{sfnp|''Cath. Enc.''|1913}} with whom William shared the tendency of analyzing his source texts through the lens of "covering" or "shieding" ({{lang|la|integumentum}}) treating any apparent contradictions or heretical content within them as an [[allegory]] or [[metaphor]] for an underlying accurate and orthodox truth.{{sfnp|Adamson|2019|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hverDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 96]}} In the passage of Plato's ''Timaeus'' stating that souls existed in the stars before birth, William opined that he really meant "nothing heretical, but the most profound philosophy sheltered in the covering of the words". He then glossed Plato's intended meaning as simply noting the accepted importance of [[Medieval Astrology|astrology]] on [[fate|human fate]].{{sfnp|Adamson|2019|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hverDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 96]}}

===''De Philosophia Mundi''===
William's chief work appears in manuscript as his ''Philosophy'' ({{lang|la|Philosophia}}){{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=36}} but, owing to mistakes in transmission and comprehension, various recensions were published for centuries as [[Venerable Bede|Bede]]'s ''Four Books of the Philosophy of the Elements'' ({{lang|la|Elementorum Philosophiae Libri Quatuor}}),{{sfnp|Herwagen|1563}}{{sfnp|Friessem|1688}}{{sfnp|Migne|1850}} [[William of Hirsau]]'s ''Three Books of Philosophical and Astronomical Instruction'' ({{lang|la|Philosophicarum et Astronomicarum Institutionum Libri Tres}}),{{sfnp|Petri|1531}} and [[Honorius of Autun]]'s ''Four Books on the Philosophy of the World'' ({{lang|la|De Philosophia Mundi Libri Quatuor}}).{{sfnp|Cratander|1544}}{{sfnp|Migne, ''Phil. Mundi''|1854}} A separate recension rediscovered in the 20th century was a ''Compendium of Philosophy'' ({{lang|la|Compendium Philosophiae}}) attributed to [[Hugh of St Victor]].{{sfnp|Ottaviano|1935}}{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|pp=39-41}} The "Honorius" recension being the most complete,{{sfnp|Poole|1920|loc=[[:s:Illustrations of the History of Medieval Thought and Learning/Appendix V|Appendix V: Excursus on a Supposed Anticipation of Saint Anselm]] }} it has become the general name for the work in modern scholarship.{{sfnp|''Brit.''|2024}} The correct title and attribution were finally discovered in 1722 by [[Remi-Casimir Oudin]]{{sfnp|Oudin|1722|loc=col. 1230}} with additional points and considerations added by [[Charles Jourdain (scholar)|Charles Jourdain]] in 1838{{sfnp|Jourdain|1838|pp=101-104}} and [[Jean-Barthélemy Hauréau]] in 1858.{{sfnp|Hauréau|1858|loc=[https://archive.org/details/nouvellebiograph22hoef/page/n347/mode/2up cols. 668–670]}}{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|pp=36-37}} It has also been known as William's ''Lesser Philosophy'' ({{lang|la|Philosophia Minor}}){{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|p=37}} by comparison with the misnamed, miscredited, and misdescribed {{lang|la|Magna de Naturis Philosophia}}. More recently, [[Gregor Maurach]] produced partial and complete editions of the text compiled from numerous manuscripts{{sfnp|Maurach, ''Phil. Mundi''|1974}}{{sfnp|Maurach, ''Acta Cl.''|1974}}{{sfnp|Maurach & al.|1980}} before it was fully realized that William had composed two separate editions, one during his youth and another revised around the time of Bernard's attacks on Abelard and others.{{sfnp|Ferrara|2016|pp=38-39}} According to [[Paul Edward Dutton]]'s tally, 68 manuscripts of the original edition and 16 of the revised edition are currently known to exist.{{sfnp|Dutton|2006|pp=37-39}}{{sfnp|Dutton|2011|pp=477-485}}

The first edition of the {{lang|la|De Philosophia Mundi}} was divided into four books,{{sfnp|Parra|1943|p=177}} covering [[medieval physics|physics]], [[medieval astronomy|astronomy]], [[medieval geography|geography]], [[medieval meteorology|meteorology]], and [[Medieval medicine of Western Europe|medicine]]. The revised edition expanded the first book and divided it into three parts, making up six books altogether.{{sfnp|Parra|1943|p=177}}

William glosses the composition of the world as rooted in the [[classical element|four elements]] but follows [[Constantine the African]] in considering an element "the simplest and minimum part of any body—simple in quality, minimum in quantity".{{efn|{{lang|la|Elementum ergo, ut ait Constantinus in Pantegni, est simpla et minima pars alicuius corporis—simpla ad qualitatem, minima ad quantitatem}}.<ref name=dpm>{{lang|la|De Philosophia Mundi}}, Book I, Ch. 22.</ref>}} Therefore, he does not identify elemental fire, air, water, or earth with any of the composite forms in which they are experienced by humans.{{efn|{{lang|la|Si ergo illis digna velimus imponere nomina, particulas praedictas dicamus "elementa", ista quae videntur "elementata".}}<ref name=dpm/>}} He argues that the pure forms of the elements cannot be perceived but only grasped by reason applied to abstracted division of sensible forms.{{efn|{{lang|la|Quae elementa numquam videntur, sed ratione divisionis intelliguntur}}.<ref name=dpm/>}} He considers that these pure elements are defined by their intrinsic [[temperature]] and [[moistness]]: earth was cold and dry, water cold and moist, air hot and moist, and fire hot and dry. These traits compelled the atoms into certain movements, which he discusses in [[Aristotelian physics#Natural motion|Aristotelian terms]].{{sfnp|Parra|1943|p=179}} In his later {{lang|la|Dragmaticon}}, he responds to {{lang|la|[[reductio ad absurdum]]}} objections against the infinities implicit in [[atomism]] with his belief that the atoms are infinitely divisible only in the sense that they are too minuscule for human apprehension and infinitely numerous only in the sense that their number is{{mdash}}for humans{{mdash}}incalculably large.{{sfnp|Adamson|2019|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hverDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA99 99]}}

Discussing cosmology, William elaborates a [[geocentrism|geocentric universe]].{{sfnp|Parra|1943|pp=179-180}} The [[atmosphere of Earth|terrestrial atmosphere]] is said to become less [[density|dense]] and colder as [[altitude]] increases. [[atmospheric circulation|Its circulation]] is also compared to [[ocean currents]].{{fact|date=May 2024}} By the level of the moon, it has been replaced by the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]];{{sfnp|Parra|1943|p=180}} with Plato, he considers this to be a form of fire rather than Aristotle's separate element.{{sfnp|Adamson|2019|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hverDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA99 99–100]}} The sun, moon, and five known planets followed their own motions while the [[fixed stars]] simply followed the motion of the ether itself.{{sfnp|Parra|1943|p=180}} William presented three [[arguments for the existence of God]] based on the [[order of the world]].{{sfnp|Parra|1943|p=179}} He identified the parts of the [[Holy Trinity|Trinity]] with their attributes: [[God the Father]] as Power, [[Jesus Christ|Jesus the Son]] as Wisdom, and the [[Holy Spirit]] as Will or Goodness.{{sfnp|Parra|1943|p=179}} Unlike Abelard, he did not argue that God could not avoid creation but he did tend to limit the direct acts of God to creation, with [[Angels in Christianity|angels]] otherwise intermediary between [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]] and this world.{{sfnp|Parra|1943|p=179}} However, his understanding of the physical world did prompt him to reject various parts of scripture, including that there is water in or beyond the heavens<ref>{{bibleref|Genesis|1:6–8|KJV}}</ref> or that [[Eve]] was created from [[Adam]]'s [[Adam's rib|rib]].<ref>{{bibleref|Genesis|2:21–22|KJV}}</ref>{{sfnp|Adamson|2019|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hverDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA99 99–100]}}

The discussion of medicine deals chiefly with [[human sexual activity|procreation]] and [[childbirth]]. William's treatment here and in the {{lang|la|Dragmaticon}} includes various medieval European and Arab misconceptions, such as explanations for why [[Preterm birth|premature infants]] born in the 8th month of pregnancy (supposedly) invariably died while those born in the 7th month sometimes lived.{{sfnp|Adamson|2019|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hverDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA100 100]}} The supposed infrequency at which [[Medieval prostitution|prostitutes]] gave birth was taken as evidence that [[sexual pleasure|pleasure]] was necessary for conception, while [[pregnancy from rape|births]] from [[medieval rape|rape]] was then taken as proof that women derived carnal pleasure from the act despite their lack of rational consent.{{sfnp|Adamson|2019|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hverDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA100 100]}} This work influenced [[Jean de Meung]], the author of the second part of the {{lang|fr|[[Roman de la Rose]]}}.{{fact|date=May 2024}} William's discussion of psychology was expressed in terms of the [[Soul in Christianity|soul]], which he considered to provide various powers when joined to the body.{{sfnp|Parra|1943|p=179}} He believed that sense perception derived from the world, reason from God, and that memory preserved them both.{{sfnp|Parra|1943|p=179}}
