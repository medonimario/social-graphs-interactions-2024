'''Louis Couturat''' ({{IPA|fr|kutyʁa|lang}}; 17 January 1868 – 3 August 1914) was a French [[logic]]ian, [[mathematician]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], and [[linguistics|linguist]]. Couturat was a pioneer of the [[constructed language]] [[Ido (language)|Ido]].

== Life and education ==
Born in Paris. In 1887 he entered [[École Normale Supérieure]] to study [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]]. In 1895 he lectured in philosophy at the [[University of Toulouse]] and 1897 lectured in [[philosophy of mathematics]] at the [[University of Caen Normandy]], taking a stand in favor of [[transfinite number]]s. After a time in [[Hanover]] studying the writings of [[Leibniz]], he became an assistant to [[Henri-Louis Bergson]] at the [[Collège de France]] in 1905.

== Career ==
He was the French advocate of the [[symbolic logic]] that emerged in the years before World War I, thanks to the writings of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Giuseppe Peano]] and his school, and especially to ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' by Couturat's friend and correspondent [[Bertrand Russell]]. Like Russell, Couturat saw symbolic logic as a tool to advance both mathematics and the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. In this, he was opposed by [[Henri Poincaré]], who took considerable exception to Couturat's efforts to interest the French in symbolic logic. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that Couturat was in broad agreement with the [[logicism]] of Russell, while Poincaré anticipated [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]]'s [[intuitionism]].

His first major publication was ''De Platonicis mythis'' (1896). In 1901, he published ''La Logique de Leibniz'', a detailed study of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] the logician, based on his examination of the huge Leibniz ''[[Nachlass]]'' in Hanover. Even though Leibniz had died in 1716, his ''Nachlass'' was cataloged only in 1895. Only then was it possible to determine the extent of Leibniz's unpublished work on logic. In 1903, Couturat published much of that work in another large volume, his ''Opuscules et Fragments Inedits de Leibniz'', containing many of the documents he had examined while writing ''La Logique''. Couturat was thus the first to appreciate that Leibniz was the greatest logician during the more than 2000 years that separate [[Aristotle]] from [[George Boole]] and [[Augustus De Morgan]]. A significant part of the 20th century Leibniz revival is grounded in Couturat's editorial and exegetical efforts. This work on Leibniz attracted Russell, also the author of a 1900 book on Leibniz, and thus began their professional correspondence and friendship.

In 1905, Couturat published a work on logic and the [[foundations of mathematics]] (with an appendix on Kant's philosophy of mathematics) that was originally conceived as a translation of Russell's ''Principles of Mathematics''.  In the same year, he published ''L'Algèbre de la logique'', a classic introduction to [[Boolean algebra]] and the works of [[C.S. Peirce]] and [[Ernst Schröder (mathematician)|Ernst Schröder]].

In 1907, Couturat helped found the [[constructed language]] [[Ido (language)|Ido]], an offshoot of [[Esperanto]], and was Ido's principal advocate over the remainder of his life. By advocating a constructed international language, constructed along logical principles and with a vocabulary taken from existing European languages, Couturat was paralleling [[Peano]]'s advocacy of [[Latino sine flexione|Interlingua]]. By pushing Ido, Couturat walked in Leibniz's footsteps; Leibniz called for the creation a universal symbolic and conceptual language he named the [[characteristica universalis]].

Couturat, a confirmed [[pacifism|pacifist]], was killed when his car was hit by a car carrying orders for the mobilization of the [[French Army]], in the first stage of [[World War I]].

He appears as a character in [[Joseph Skibell]]'s 2010 novel, ''A Curable Romantic''.
