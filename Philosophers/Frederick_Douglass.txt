He became the most important leader of the movement for [[African-American]] [[Civil rights movement (1865–1896)|civil rights]] in the 19th century.

After escaping from [[slavery in Maryland]] in 1838, Douglass became a national leader of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] in [[Massachusetts]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] and gained fame for his oratory<ref>[[Willard B. Gatewood|Gatewood, Willard B. Jr.]] 1981. "Frederick Douglass and the Building of a 'Wall of Anti-Slavery Fire' 1845–1846. An Essay Review." ''[[The Florida Historical Quarterly]]'' 59(3):340–344. {{JSTOR|30147499}}.</ref> and incisive antislavery writings. Accordingly, he was described by abolitionists in his time as a living counterexample to claims by supporters of slavery that enslaved people lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens.<ref>Stewart, Roderick M. 1999. "The Claims of Frederick Douglass Philosophically Considered." ''Frederick Douglass: A Critical Reader'', B. E. Lawson and F. M. Kirkland, eds., pp. 155–156. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0-631-20578-4}}.

"Moreover, though he does not make the point explicitly, again the very fact that Douglass is ably disputing this argument on this occasion celebrating a select few's intellect and will (or moral character)—this fact constitutes a living counterexample to the narrowness of the pro-slavery definition of humans."</ref> [[Northern United States|Northerners]] at the time found it hard to believe that such a great orator had once been enslaved. It was in response to this disbelief that Douglass wrote his first autobiography.<ref>Matlack, James. 1979. "The Autobiographies of Frederick Douglass." ''Phylon (1960–)'' 40(1):15–28. {{doi|10.2307/274419}}. {{JSTOR|274419}}. p. 16: "He spoke too well. ... Since he did not talk, look, or act like a slave (in the eyes of Northern audiences), Douglass was denounced as an imposter."</ref>

Douglass wrote three autobiographies, describing his experiences as an enslaved person in his ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'' (1845), which became a bestseller and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition, as was his second book, ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]'' (1855). Following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Douglass was an active campaigner for the rights of freed slaves and wrote his last autobiography, ''[[Life and Times of Frederick Douglass]]''. First published in 1881 and revised in 1892, three years before his death, the book covers his life up to those dates. Douglass also actively supported [[women's suffrage]], and he held several public offices. Without his knowledge or consent, Douglass became the first African American nominated for vice president of the United States, [[1872 United States presidential election|as the running mate]] of [[Victoria Woodhull]] on the [[National Equal Rights Party|Equal Rights Party]] ticket.<ref name="VP" />

Douglass believed in [[dialogue]] and in making alliances across racial and ideological divides, as well as, after breaking with [[William Lloyd Garrison]], in the [[The Constitution of the United States: is it pro-slavery or anti-slavery?|anti-slavery interpretation]] of the [[Slavery and the United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nOt7au3N8FUC&q=%22Let+us+have+the+Constitution,+with+its+thirteenth,+fourteenth,+and+fifteenth+amendments,+fairly+interpreted,+faithfully+executed,+and+cheerfully+obeyed.%22&pg=PA629 |title=Frederick Douglass: Selected Speeches and Writings |year=1999 |isbn=1-55652-349-1 |editor-last=Foner |editor-first=Philip |editor-link=Philip Foner |page=629 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |quote=let us have liberty, law, and justice first.

He later wrote of his earliest times with his mother:<ref>{{Cite book |last=Douglass |first=Frederick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U69bAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA10 |title=Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Written by Himself. |publisher=H.G.

Returning much later, about 1883, to purchase land in Talbot County that was meaningful to him, he was invited to address "a colored school":

{{Poemquote|I once knew a little colored boy whose mother and father died when he was six years old. He was a slave and had no one to care for him. He slept on a dirt floor in a hovel, and in cold weather would crawl into a meal bag head foremost and leave his feet in the ashes to keep them warm. Often he would roast an ear of corn and eat it to satisfy his hunger, and many times has he crawled under the barn or stable and secured eggs, which he would roast in the fire and eat.

That boy did not wear pants like you do, but a tow linen shirt. Schools were unknown to him, and he learned to spell from an old Webster's spelling-book and to read and write from posters on cellar and barn doors, while boys and men would help him. He would then preach and speak, and soon became well known. He became Presidential Elector, United States Marshal, United States Recorder, United States diplomat, and accumulated some wealth. He wore broadcloth and didn't have to divide crumbs with the dogs under the table. That boy was Frederick Douglass.<ref>{{cite journal

===Early learning and experience===

==== The Auld family ====
{{Slavery}}At the age of 6, Douglass was separated from his grandparents and moved to the [[Wye House]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], where Aaron Anthony worked as overseer<ref name=":1" /> and [[Edward Lloyd (Governor of Maryland)|Edward Lloyd]] was his unofficial master.<ref>{{Cite book |last=McFeely |first=William S. |title=Frederick Douglass |date=1991 |publisher=W. W. Norton & Co.|isbn=978-0-393-02823-2 |location=New York & London |pages=12}}</ref> After Anthony died in 1826, Douglass was given to Lucretia Auld, wife of Thomas Auld, who sent him to serve Thomas's brother Hugh Auld and his wife Sophia Auld in [[Baltimore]]. From the day he arrived, Sophia saw to it that Douglass was properly fed and clothed, and that he slept in a bed with sheets and a blanket.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Koehn |first=Nancy |title=Forged in Crisis: The Making of Five Courageous Leaders |publisher=Scribner |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-5011-7444-5 |location=New York}}</ref> Douglass described her as a kind and tender-hearted woman, who treated him "as she supposed one human being ought to treat another."<ref>Douglass, Frederick. 1845. "[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave#Chapters 5–7|Chapter VII]]."</ref> Douglass felt that he was lucky to be in the city, where he said enslaved people were almost [[Freedman|freemen]], compared to those on plantations.

When Douglass was about 12, Sophia Auld began teaching him the [[alphabet]]. Hugh Auld disapproved of the tutoring, feeling that [[literacy]] would encourage enslaved people to desire freedom. Douglass later referred to this as the "first decidedly [[Abolitionism|antislavery]] lecture" he had ever heard. "'Very well, thought I,'" wrote Douglass. "'Knowledge unfits a child to be a slave.' I instinctively assented to the proposition, and from that moment I understood the direct pathway from slavery to freedom."<ref>Douglass, Frederick. [1881–82] 2003.

[[Courier Dover Publications]]. {{ISBN|0-486-43170-3}}.</ref>

Under her husband's influence, Sophia came to believe that education and slavery were incompatible and one day snatched a newspaper away from Douglass.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Douglass |first=Frederick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U69bAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA10 |title=Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave.

Douglass continued, secretly, to teach himself to read and write. He later often said, "knowledge is the pathway from slavery to freedom."<ref>[[Kwame Anthony Appiah|Appiah, Kwame Anthony]]. [2000] 2004. "Introduction." In ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave|<nowiki/>'Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave']] & [[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl|'Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'<nowiki/>]]''. New York: [[Modern Library]]. pp. xiii, 4.</ref> As Douglass began to read newspapers, pamphlets, political materials, and books of every description, this new realm of thought led him to question and condemn the institution of slavery. In later years, Douglass credited ''[[The Columbian Orator]]'', an anthology that he discovered at about age 12, with clarifying and defining his views on freedom and human rights. First published in 1797, the book is a classroom reader, containing essays, speeches, and dialogues, to assist students in learning reading and grammar. He later learned that his mother had also been literate, about which he would later declare:

<blockquote>I am quite willing, and even happy, to attribute any love of letters I possess, and for which I have got—despite of prejudices—only too much credit, ''not'' to my admitted Anglo-Saxon paternity, but to the native genius of my sable, unprotected, and uncultivated ''mother''—a woman, who belonged to a race whose mental endowments it is, at present, fashionable to hold in disparagement and contempt.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Douglass |first=Frederick |title=My Bondage and My Freedom |date=1855 |publisher=Miller, Orton & Mulligan |edition=1st |location=New York and Auburn |page=[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:My_Bondage_and_My_Freedom_(1855).djvu/68 58]}}</ref></blockquote>

====William Freeland====
When Douglass was hired out to William Freeland, he "gathered eventually more than thirty male slaves on Sundays, and sometimes even on weeknights, in a Sabbath literacy school."<ref>[[David W. Blight|Blight, David W.]], ''Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom'', p.&nbsp;68.</ref>

====Edward Covey====
In 1833, Thomas Auld took Douglass back from Hugh ("[a]s a means of punishing Hugh," Douglass later wrote). Thomas sent Douglass to work for Edward Covey, a poor farmer who had a reputation as a "slave-breaker". He [[Flagellation|whipped]] Douglass so frequently that his wounds had little time to heal.

==Escape from slavery==
Douglass first tried to escape from Freeland, who had hired him from his owner, but was unsuccessful. In 1837, Douglass met and fell in love with [[Anna Murray Douglass|Anna Murray]], a [[Free people of color|free black]] woman in Baltimore about five years his senior. Her free status strengthened his belief in the possibility of gaining his own freedom. Murray encouraged him and supported his efforts by aid and money.<ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA124">{{cite book |first1=Michelle Nzadi |last1=Keita |first2=James |last2=Jones |contribution=Murray-Douglass, Anna (1813–1882) |editor1-first=Julius E. |editor1-last=Thompson |editor2-first=James L.

On September 3, 1838, Douglass successfully escaped by boarding a northbound train of the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]] in Baltimore.<ref>{{cite web |date=February 14, 2018 |title=Today in African-American Transportation History – 1818: Frederick Douglass Begins His Journey into History |url=https://transportationhistory.org/2018/02/14/today-in-african-american-transportation-history-1818-frederick-douglass-begins-his-journey-into-history/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731224353/https://transportationhistory.org/2018/02/14/today-in-african-american-transportation-history-1818-frederick-douglass-begins-his-journey-into-history/ |archive-date=July 31, 2020 |access-date=February 10, 2020 |website=Transportation History |publisher=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials}}</ref> The area where he boarded was formerly thought to be a short distance east of the train depot, in a recently developed neighborhood between the modern neighborhoods of [[Harbor East]] and [[Little Italy, Baltimore|Little Italy]]. This depot was at President and Fleet Streets, east of [[Inner Harbor|"The Basin"]] of the [[Port of Baltimore|Baltimore harbor]], on the northwest branch of the [[Patapsco River]].

Douglass reached [[Havre de Grace, Maryland]], in [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]], in the northeast corner of the state, along the southwest shore of the [[Susquehanna River]], which flowed into the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Although this placed him only some {{convert|20|mi}} from the Maryland–Pennsylvania state line, it was easier to continue by rail through Delaware, another slave state. Dressed in a sailor's [[uniform]] provided to him by Murray, who also gave him part of her savings to cover his travel costs, he carried identification papers and [[protection papers]] that he had obtained from a free black seaman.<ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA124" /><ref>{{cite web |first=Shirley |last=Yee |date=February 11, 2007 |title=Anna Murray Douglass (c. 1813–1882) |url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aah/douglass-anna-murray-c-1813-1882 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902004244/https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/douglass-anna-murray-c-1813-1882/ |archive-date=September 2, 2021 |access-date=February 27, 2011 |website=[[BlackPast.org]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Waldo E.

Douglass crossed the wide Susquehanna River by the railroad's steam-ferry at Havre de Grace to [[Perryville, Maryland|Perryville]] on the opposite shore, in [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]], then continued by train across the state line to [[Wilmington, Delaware]], a large port at the head of the [[Delaware Bay]]. From there, because the rail line was not yet completed, he went by [[steamboat]] along the [[Delaware River]] farther northeast to the "Quaker City" of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, an anti-slavery stronghold. He continued to the safe house of abolitionist [[David Ruggles]] in [[History of New York City|New York City]]. His entire journey to freedom took less than 24 hours.<ref name="SouthCoast">{{Cite news |date=February 17, 2008 |title=Discovering Anna Murray Douglass |work=[[South Coast Today]] |url=https://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080217/NEWS/802170364 |url-status=live |access-date=February 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716112833/http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080217%2FNEWS%2F802170364 |archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref> Douglass later wrote of his arrival in New York City:

{{blockquote|I have often been asked, how I felt when first I found myself on free soil. And my readers may share the same curiosity. There is scarcely anything in my experience about which I could not give a more satisfactory answer. A new world had opened upon me. If life is more than breath, and the 'quick round of blood,' I lived more in one day than in a year of my slave life. It was a time of joyous excitement which words can but tamely describe. In a letter written to a friend soon after reaching New York, I said: 'I felt as one might feel upon escape from a den of hungry lions.' Anguish and grief, like darkness and rain, may be depicted; but gladness and joy, like the rainbow, defy the skill of pen or pencil.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Douglass |first=Frederick |title=Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, Written by Himself, His Early Life as a Slave, His Escape from Bondage, and His Complete History to the Present Time |title-link=Life and Times of Frederick Douglass |date=1881 |publisher=Christian Age Office |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeandtimesfre00douggoog/page/n187 170]}}</ref>}}

Once Douglass had arrived, he sent for Murray to follow him north to New York. She brought the basic supplies for them to set up a home. They were married on September 15, 1838, by a black [[Presbyterian]] minister, just eleven days after Douglass had reached New York.<ref name=SouthCoast/> At first they adopted Johnson as their married name, to divert attention.<ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA124" />

==Religious views==
As a child, Douglass was exposed to a number of religious sermons, and in his youth, he sometimes heard Sophia Auld reading the [[Bible]]. In time, he became interested in literacy; he began reading and copying bible verses, and he eventually [[Conversion to Christianity|converted to Christianity]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Ivory |last=Phillips |contribution=Christianity |editor1-first=Julius E. |editor1-last=Thompson |editor2-first=James L.

<blockquote>I was not more than thirteen years old when, in my loneliness and destitution, I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight of God: that they were but natural rebels against his government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise. I consulted a good coloured man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to "cast all my care upon God." This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.<ref>{{cite book |last=Douglass |first=Frederick |title=Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, Written by Himself, His Early Life as a Slave, His Escape from Bondage, and His Compete History to the Present Time |title-link=Life and Times of Frederick Douglass |date=1881 |publisher=Christian Age Office |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeandtimesfre00douggoog/page/n85/mode/2up 63]}}</ref><ref>In the Citadel Press facsimile edition (Kensington Publishing Corp., 1983), the quotation is on pp. 82-83. In this version, in the first sentence, the first comma is before rather than after "when", and "coloured" is spelled "colored".</ref></blockquote>

Douglass was mentored by Rev. Charles Lawson, and, early in his activism, he often included biblical allusions and religious metaphors in his speeches. Although a believer, he strongly criticized religious hypocrisy<ref name="lib.rochester.edu">{{cite web |date=February 4, 2011 |title=Frederick Douglass Project: 'Fourth of July' Speech |url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=2945 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204070311/http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=2945 |archive-date=February 4, 2011 |access-date=March 15, 2019}}</ref> and accused slaveholders of "[[wickedness]]", lack of morality, and failure to follow the [[Golden Rule]]. In this sense, Douglass distinguished between the "Christianity of Christ" and the "Christianity of America" and considered religious slaveholders and clergymen who defended slavery as the most brutal, sinful, and cynical of all who represented "wolves in sheep's clothing".<ref name="Finkelman129" /><ref>''Love of God, Love of Man, Love of Country''. Delivered at Market Hall, New York City, October 22, 1847.</ref>

In ''[[What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?]]'', an oration Douglass gave in the Corinthian Hall of Rochester,<ref>{{cite web |title=What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July? |url=https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/what-to-the-slave-is-the-fourth-of-july/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705134303/https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/what-to-the-slave-is-the-fourth-of-july/ |archive-date=July 5, 2020 |access-date=July 5, 2020 |website=Teaching American History}}</ref> he sharply criticized the attitude of religious people who kept silent about slavery, and he charged that ministers committed a "[[blasphemy]]" when they taught it as sanctioned by religion. He considered that a law passed to support slavery was "one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty" and said that pro-slavery clergymen within the American Church "stripped the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throne of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form", and "an abomination in the sight of God".<ref name="lib.rochester.edu" />

Of ministers like John Chase Lord, Leonard Elijah Lathrop, [[Ichabod Spencer]], and [[Orville Dewey]], he said that they taught, against the Scriptures, that "we ought to obey man's law before the law of God". He further asserted, "in speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are. Noble men may be found, scattered all over these Northern States ... [[Henry Ward Beecher]] of Brooklyn, [[Samuel J. May]] of Syracuse, and my esteemed friend [Robert R. Raymonde]".<ref name="lib.rochester.edu" />

He maintained that "upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave's redemption from his chains". In addition, he called religious people to embrace abolitionism, stating, "let the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds."<ref name="lib.rochester.edu" />

During his visits to the United Kingdom between 1846 and 1848, Douglass asked British Christians never to support American churches that permitted slavery,<ref>{{cite book |first=Oleta |last=Prinsloo |contribution=Abolitionists |editor1-first=Julius E. |editor1-last=Thompson |editor2-first=James L. Jr. |editor2-last=Conyers |editor3-first=Nancy J. |editor3-last=Dawson |title=The Frederick Douglass Encyclopedia |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-313-31988-4 |page=2}}</ref> and he expressed his happiness to know that a group of ministers in Belfast had refused to admit slaveholders as members of the Church.

On his return to the United States, Douglass founded the ''North Star'', a weekly publication with the motto "Right is of no sex, Truth is of no color, God is the Father of us all, and we are all Brethren." In his 1848 "Letter to Thomas Auld", Douglass denounced his former slaveholder for leaving Douglass's family illiterate:

{{blockquote|Your wickedness and cruelty committed in this respect on your fellow-creatures, are greater than all the stripes you have laid upon my back, or theirs. It is an outrage upon the soul—a war upon the immortal spirit, and one for which you must give account at the bar of our common Father and Creator.<ref name="AuldLetter"/>}}

Douglass praised the [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] orator [[Robert G.

Perhaps there were Christian ministers and Christian families in Peoria at that time by whom I might have been received in the same gracious manner ... but in my former visits to this place I had failed to meet them".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tarted |first1=Steve |title=A Meeting Of Giants |url=https://www.peoriamagazine.com/article/meeting-giants/ |access-date=June 30, 2024 |publisher=Peoria Magazine}}</ref>

Douglass and [[Anna Murray Douglass|Anna Murray]] had five children: [[Rosetta Douglass]], [[Lewis Henry Douglass]], [[Frederick Douglass Jr.]], [[Charles Remond Douglass]], and Annie Douglass (died at the age of ten). Charles and Rosetta helped produce his newspapers.

Anna Douglass remained a loyal supporter of her husband's public work. His relationships with [[Julia Griffiths]] and [[Ottilie Assing]], two women with whom he was professionally involved, caused recurring speculation and scandals.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Michelle Nzadi |last1=Keita |first2=James |last2=Jones |contribution=Murray-Douglass, Anna (1813–1882) |editor1-first=Julius E. |editor1-last=Thompson |editor2-first=James L.

Assing held Anna Douglass "in utter contempt" and was vainly hoping that Douglass would separate from his wife. Douglass biographer David W. Blight concludes that Assing and Douglass "were probably lovers".<ref name="Blight290" /> Though Douglass and Assing are widely believed to have had an intimate relationship, the surviving correspondence contains no proof of such a relationship.<ref>{{cite book |last=Blight |first=David W. |author-link=David W.

Anna died in 1882. In 1884, Douglass married [[Helen Pitts Douglass|Helen Pitts]], a white suffragist and abolitionist from [[Honeoye, New York]]. Pitts was the daughter of Gideon Pitts Jr., an abolitionist colleague and friend of Douglass's. A graduate of [[Mount Holyoke College]] (then called Mount Holyoke Female Seminary), Pitts worked on a radical feminist publication named ''Alpha'' while living in Washington, D.C. She later worked as Douglass's secretary.<ref>[[Adam Gopnik]], "American Prophet: The gifts of Frederick Douglass", ''The New Yorker'', October 15, 2018, pp. 81–82</ref>

The couple settled in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] (an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] center, full of former enslaved people), in 1838, moving to [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], in 1841.<ref name="nps.gov">{{cite web |title=Frederick Douglass Chronology – Frederick Douglass National Historic Site|url=https://www.nps.gov/frdo/learn/historyculture/frederick-douglass-chronology.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705150721/https://www.nps.gov/frdo/learn/historyculture/frederick-douglass-chronology.htm |archive-date=July 5, 2018 |access-date=June 1, 2018 |website=nps.gov (U.S. National Park Service) }}</ref> After meeting and staying with [[Nathan Johnson (abolitionist)|Nathan and Mary Johnson]], they adopted Douglass as their married name.<ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA124" /> Douglass had grown up using his mother's surname of Bailey; after escaping slavery he had changed his surname first to Stanley and then to Johnson. In New Bedford, the latter was such a common name that he wanted one that was more distinctive, and asked Nathan Johnson to choose a suitable surname. Nathan suggested "[[Douglass (surname)|Douglass]]", after having read the poem ''[[The Lady of the Lake (poem)|The Lady of the Lake]]'' by [[Walter Scott]], in which two of the principal characters have the surname "[[Douglas (surname)|Douglas]]".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Frederick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHInBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT115 |title=Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Written by Himself (Civil War Classics) |last2=Douglass |date=2015 |publisher=Diversion Books |isbn=978-1-62681-687-9 |pages=115–116 |access-date=October 28, 2016 |archive-date=September 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902004228/https://books.google.com/books?id=UHInBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT115 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Frederick Douglass |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66EqDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA177 |title=Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Written by Himself, Critical Edition |year= 2016 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-22529-7 |page=177 |access-date=July 5, 2018 |archive-date=August 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801200538/https://books.google.com/books?id=66EqDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA177 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Douglass thought of joining a white [[Methodist Church]], but was disappointed, from the beginning, upon finding that it was [[Racial segregation|segregated]]. Later, he joined the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]], an independent [[black church|black denomination]] first established in New York City, which counted among its members [[Sojourner Truth]] and [[Harriet Tubman]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Lee |editor-first=Maurice S. |date=2009 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Frederick Douglass |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=63}}</ref> He became a licensed preacher in 1839,<ref name="pbs.org">{{cite web |title=This Far by Faith.

He held various positions, including [[Stewardship|steward]], [[Sunday school|Sunday-school]] [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]], and [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In 1840, Douglass delivered a speech in [[Elmira, New York]], then a station on the [[Underground Railroad]], in which a black congregation would form years later, becoming the region's largest church by 1940.<ref name="religionnews.com">[http://www.religionnews.com/2013/06/19/5-religious-facts-you-might-not-know-about-frederick-douglass/ "Religious Facts You Might Not Know about Frederick Douglass"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226003441/http://www.religionnews.com/2013/06/19/5-religious-facts-you-might-not-know-about-frederick-douglass/|date=February 26, 2014}}, ''Religion News'', June 19, 2013.</ref>

Douglass also joined several organizations in New Bedford and regularly attended abolitionist meetings. He subscribed to [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s weekly newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]''. He later said that "no face and form ever impressed me with such sentiments [of the hatred of slavery] as did those of William Lloyd Garrison." So deep was this influence that in his last autobiography, Douglass said "his paper took a place in my heart second only to [[Bible|The Bible]]."<ref>Douglass, Frederick. [1881] 2008. ''[[Life and Times of Frederick Douglass]]''. Cosimo, Inc., p. 149 {{ISBN|978-1-60520-399-7}}.</ref>

Garrison was likewise impressed with Douglass and had written about his anti-[[American Colonization Society|colonization]] stance in ''The Liberator'' as early as 1839. Douglass first heard Garrison speak in 1841, at a lecture that Garrison gave in Liberty Hall, New Bedford. At another meeting, Douglass was unexpectedly invited to speak. After telling his story, Douglass was encouraged to become an anti-slavery lecturer. A few days later, Douglass spoke at the [[Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society]]'s annual convention, in [[Nantucket]]. Then 23 years old, Douglass conquered his nervousness and gave an eloquent speech about his life as a slave.

While living in Lynn, Douglass engaged in an early protest against segregated transportation. In September 1841, at [[Lynn station|Lynn Central Square station]], Douglass and his friend [[James N. Buffum]] were thrown off an [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] train because Douglass refused to sit in the segregated railroad coach.<ref name="nps.gov" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Transportation Protests: 1841 to 1992 |url=https://www.civilrightsteaching.org/desegregation/transportation-protests/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180806054632/https://www.civilrightsteaching.org/desegregation/transportation-protests/ |archive-date=August 6, 2018 |access-date=June 1, 2018 |website=civilrightsteaching.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=March 10, 2009 |title=Resistance to the Segregation of Public Transportation in the Early 1840s |url=http://primaryresearch.org/resistance-to-the-segregation-of-public-transportation-in-the-early-1840s/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180806031930/http://primaryresearch.org/resistance-to-the-segregation-of-public-transportation-in-the-early-1840s/ |archive-date=August 6, 2018 |access-date=June 1, 2018 |website=primaryresearch.org}}</ref><ref>{{Wikisource-inline|Page:My Bondage and My Freedom (1855).djvu/411|single=true}}</ref>

In 1843, Douglass joined other speakers in the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]]'s "Hundred Conventions" project, a six-month tour at meeting halls throughout the [[Eastern United States|eastern]] and [[midwestern United States]]. During this tour, slavery supporters frequently accosted Douglass. At a lecture in [[Pendleton, Indiana]], an angry mob chased and beat Douglass before a local Quaker family, the Hardys, rescued him. His hand was broken in the attack; it healed improperly and bothered him for the rest of his life.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Douglass |first=Frederick |title=Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, Written by Himself, His Early Life as a Slave, His Escape from Bondage, and His Complete History to the Present Time |title-link=Life and Times of Frederick Douglass |date=1881 |publisher=Christian Age Office |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/lifeandtimesfre00douggoog/page/n265 287]–88}}</ref> A stone marker in Falls Park in the [[Pendleton Historic District (Pendleton, Indiana)|Pendleton Historic District]] commemorates this event.

In 1847, Douglass explained to Garrison, "I have no love for America, as such; I have no patriotism. I have no country. What country have I? The Institutions of this Country do not know me – do not recognize me as a man."<ref>{{cite news |first=Frederick |last=Douglass |url=https://glc.yale.edu/country-conscience-and-anti-slavery-cause |title=Country, Conscience, and the Anti-Slavery Cause: An Address Delivered in New York City, May 11, 1847 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731203800/https://glc.yale.edu/country-conscience-and-anti-slavery-cause |archive-date=July 31, 2020 |newspaper=New York Daily Tribune |date=May 13, 1847}} Reprinted in {{cite book |editor1-last=Blassingame |editor1-first=John W. |editor2-first=John R. |editor2-last=McKivigan |title=The Frederick Douglass Papers: Series One—Speeches, Debates, and Interviews |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |date=1979 |volume=2 |page=57}}</ref>

===Autobiography===
Douglass's best-known work is his first autobiography, ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'', written during his time in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]]<ref>{{Cite news |title=Re-Examining Fredrick Douglass's Time in Lynn |publisher=Lynn Daily Item / itemlive.com |url=https://www.itemlive.com/2018/02/02/re-examining-fredrick-douglasss-time-lynn/ |url-status=live |access-date=June 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221122601/https://www.itemlive.com/2018/02/02/re-examining-fredrick-douglasss-time-lynn/ |archive-date=December 21, 2020}}</ref> and published in 1845. At the time, some skeptics questioned whether a black man could have produced such an eloquent piece of literature. The book received generally positive reviews and became an immediate bestseller. Within three years, it had been reprinted nine times, with 11,000 copies circulating in the United States. It was also translated into French and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and published in Europe.

Douglass published three autobiographies during his lifetime (and revised the third of these), each time expanding on the previous one. The 1845 ''Narrative'' was his biggest seller and probably allowed him to raise the funds to gain his legal freedom the following year, as discussed below. In 1855, Douglass published ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]''. In 1881, in his sixties, Douglass published ''[[Life and Times of Frederick Douglass]]'', which he revised in 1892.

===Travels to Ireland and Great Britain===

Douglass's friends and mentors feared that the publicity would draw the attention of his ex-owner, Hugh Auld, who might try to get his "property" back. They encouraged Douglass to tour Ireland, as many former slaves had done. Douglass set sail on the ''Cambria'' for [[Liverpool]], England, on August 16, 1845. He traveled in Ireland as the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] was beginning.

The feeling of freedom from American [[racial discrimination]] amazed Douglass:<ref name="My Bondage">Douglass, Frederick. [1885] 2003.

<blockquote>Eleven days and a half gone, and I have crossed three thousand miles of the perilous deep. Instead of a democratic government, I am under a monarchical government. Instead of the bright, blue sky of America, I am covered with the soft, grey fog of the Emerald Isle [Ireland]. I breathe, and lo! the chattel [slave] becomes a man. I gaze around in vain for one who will question my equal humanity, claim me as his slave, or offer me an insult. I employ a cab—I am seated beside white people—I reach the hotel—I enter the same door—I am shown into the same parlor—I dine at the same table—and no one is offended.... I find myself regarded and treated at every turn with the kindness and deference paid to white people. When I go to church, I am met by no upturned nose and scornful lip to tell me, {{'}}''We don't allow niggers in here!''{{'}}</blockquote>

Still, Douglass was astounded by the extreme levels of poverty he encountered in Dublin, much of it reminding him of his experiences in slavery.  In a letter to [[William Lloyd Garrison]], Douglass wrote "I see much here to remind me of my former condition, and I confess I should be ashamed to lift up my voice against American slavery, but that I know the cause of humanity is one the world over. He who really and truly feels for the American slave, cannot steel his heart to the woes of others; and he who thinks himself an abolitionist, yet cannot enter into the wrongs of others, has yet to find a true foundation for his anti-slavery faith."<ref>[https://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/douglass/support12.html ''The Liberator'', 27 March 1846] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210520062708/https://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/douglass/support12.html |date=May 20, 2021 }}; reprinted in Philip Foner, ed., ''Life and Writings of Frederick Douglass'', vol. 1 (New York: International Publishers, 1950), p. 138.</ref>

Douglass spent two years in Ireland and Great Britain, lecturing in churches and chapels. His draw was such that some facilities were "crowded to suffocation". One example was his hugely popular ''London Reception Speech'', which Douglass delivered in May 1846 at [[Alexander Fletcher (minister)|Alexander Fletcher]]'s [[Finsbury Chapel]]. Douglass remarked that in England he was treated not "as a color, but as a man".<ref name="Ruuth">{{Cite book |last=Ruuth |first=Marianne |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Lx8nXxmAlcC&q=Douglass%2520-%2520england%2520-%2520not%2520%2522as%2520a%2520color%252C%2520but%2520as%2520a%2520manFrederick+Douglass&pg=PA118 |title=Frederick Douglass: Patriot and Activist |date=1995 |publisher=Holloway House Publishing |isbn=978-0-87067-773-1 |pages=117–118 |language=en |access-date=January 21, 2022 |archive-date=February 17, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220217142500/https://books.google.com/books?id=4Lx8nXxmAlcC&q=Douglass%2520-%2520england%2520-%2520not%2520%2522as%2520a%2520color%252C%2520but%2520as%2520a%2520manFrederick+Douglass&pg=PA118 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1846, Douglass met with [[Thomas Clarkson]], one of the last living British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]], who had persuaded Parliament to abolish slavery in Great Britain's colonies.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], ''[[Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution]]'', New York: HarperCollins, 2006, pp. 415–21.</ref> During this trip Douglass became legally free, as British supporters led by [[Anna Richardson (abolitionist)|Anna Richardson]] and her sister-in-law Ellen of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] raised funds to buy his freedom from his American owner Thomas Auld.<ref name="Ruuth" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Frances E.

Douglass's change of opinion about the Constitution and his splitting from Garrison around 1847 became one of the abolitionist movement's most notable divisions. Douglass angered Garrison by saying that the Constitution could and should be used as an instrument in the fight against slavery.<ref>Robert Fanuzzi, "Frederick Douglass' 'Colored Newspaper': Identity Politics in Black and White," in ''The Black Press: New Literary and Historical Essays'', Todd Vogel, ed.

On July 24, 1851, "shortly after his announced change of opinion", Douglass delivered a speech titled, "Is the United States Constitution For or Against Slavery".<ref>Rebeiro, footnotes 51 and 67.</ref> He expressed his changed views again in an 1860 speech in Glasgow, Scotland, titled, "[[The Constitution of the United States: is it pro-slavery or anti-slavery?]]". In that speech, he said, "When I escaped from slavery, and was introduced to the Garrisonians, I adopted very many of their opinions.... I was young, had read but little, and naturally took some things on trust. Subsequent reading and experience", however, "brought me to other conclusions". He now believed that "dissolution of the American Union", which Garrison advocated, "would place the slave system more exclusively under the control of the slaveholding States...." In addition, "Mr. Garrison and his friends tell us that while in the Union we are responsible for slavery.... I deny that going out of the Union would free us from that responsibility.... The American people in the Northern States have helped to enslave the black people. Their duty will not be done till they give them back their plundered rights."<ref>[https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/1860-frederick-douglass-constitution-united-states-it-pro-slavery-or-anti-slavery/ (1860) Frederick Douglass, "The Constitution of the United States: Is it Pro-slavery or Anti-slavery?"], full text.

===Letter to his former owner===
In September 1848, on the tenth anniversary of his escape, Douglass published an open letter addressed to his former master, Thomas Auld, berating him for his conduct, and inquiring after members of his family still held by Auld.<ref name="Finkelman2006-105" /><ref name="Douglass1848" /> In the course of the letter, Douglass adeptly transitions from formal and restrained to familiar and then to impassioned. At one point he is the proud parent, describing his improved circumstances and the progress of his own four young children. But then he dramatically shifts tone:

<blockquote>Oh! sir, a slaveholder never appears to me so completely an agent of hell, as when I think of and look upon my dear children. It is then that my feelings rise above my control. ... The grim horrors of slavery rise in all their ghastly terror before me, the wails of millions pierce my heart, and chill my blood. I remember the chain, the gag, the bloody whip, the deathlike gloom overshadowing the broken spirit of the fettered bondman, the appalling liability of his being torn away from wife and children, and sold like a beast in the market.<ref name="AuldLetter">{{cite web |last=Douglass |first=Fredrick |date=September 3, 1848 |title=Letter to Thomas Auld |url=https://glc.yale.edu/letter-thomas-auld-september-3-1848 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029235339/https://glc.yale.edu/letter-thomas-auld-september-3-1848 |archive-date=29 October 2020 |access-date=24 October 2020 |publisher=glc.yale.edu}}</ref></blockquote>

Indeed, I should esteem it a privilege, to set you an example as to how mankind ought to treat each other."<ref name="AuldLetter" />

===Women's rights===
In 1848, Douglass was the only black person to attend the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention, in upstate New York.<ref>{{cite web |date=August 18, 1920 |title=Seneca Falls Convention |url=http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/doc/seneca_falls |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717211129/http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/doc/seneca_falls |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |access-date=April 20, 2011 |publisher=Virginia Memory}}</ref><ref>Stanton, 1997, p. 85.</ref> [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] asked the assembly to pass a resolution asking for [[women's suffrage]].<ref>USConstitution.net.

He suggested that the world would be a better place if [[Women in government|women were involved in the political sphere]]:

{{blockquote|In this denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world.<ref name="McMillen93">McMillen, 2008, pp. 93–94.</ref>}}

Retrieved April 24, 2009.</ref>

In the wake of the Seneca Falls Convention, Douglass used an editorial in ''The North Star'' to press the case for women's rights. He recalled the "marked ability and dignity" of the proceedings, and briefly conveyed several arguments of the convention and feminist thought at the time.

On the first count, Douglass acknowledged the "decorum" of the participants in the face of disagreement. In the remainder, he discussed the primary document that emerged from the conference, a Declaration of Sentiments, and the "infant" feminist cause. He criticized opponents of women's rights: "A discussion of the rights of animals would be regarded with far more complacency by many of what are called the ''wise'' and the ''good'' of our land, than would be a discussion of the rights of woman."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Image 3 of The North star (Rochester, NY), July 28, 1848 |url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn84026365/1848-07-28/ed-1/?dl=issue&sp=1&st=image |access-date=June 22, 2024 |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref> He also noted the link between abolitionism and feminism, the overlap between the communities.

His opinion as the editor of a prominent newspaper carried weight, and he stated the position of the ''North Star'' explicitly: "We hold woman to be justly entitled to all we claim for man." This letter, written a week after the convention, reaffirmed the first part of the paper's slogan, "right is of no sex."

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] giving black men the right to vote was being debated, Douglass split with the Stanton-led faction of the women's rights movement. Douglass supported the amendment, which would grant suffrage to black men. Stanton opposed the 15th Amendment because it limited the expansion of suffrage to black men; she predicted its passage would delay for decades the cause for women's right to vote. Stanton argued that American women and black men should band together to fight for [[universal suffrage]], and opposed any bill that split the issues.<ref name="DouglassO" /> Douglass and Stanton both knew that there was not yet enough male support for women's right to vote, but that an amendment giving black men the vote could pass in the late 1860s. Stanton wanted to attach women's suffrage to that of black men so that her cause would be carried to success.<ref name="Foner, p.600">Foner, p. 600.</ref>

Douglass thought such a strategy was too risky, that there was barely enough support for black men's suffrage. He feared that linking the cause of women's suffrage to that of black men would result in failure for both. Douglass argued that white women, already empowered by their social connections to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. Black women, he believed, would have the same degree of empowerment as white women once black men had the vote.<ref name="Foner, p.600" /> Douglass assured the American women that at no time had he ever argued against women's right to vote.<ref>{{cite book |last=Watkins |first=Valetha |contribution=National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) |editor1-first=Julius E. |editor1-last=Thompson |editor2-first=James L.

===Ideological refinement===
[[File:Motto frederick douglass 2.jpg|thumb|Frederick Douglass in 1856, around 38 years of age]]
In 1850, Douglass was elected the vice president of the [[American League of Colored Laborers]], the first black labor union in the United States, which he had also helped found.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bradley |first=Jonathan |date=January 4, 2011 |title=American League of Colored Laborers (1850-?) |url=https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/american-league-colored-laborers-1850/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240205065637/https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/american-league-colored-laborers-1850/ |archive-date=February 5, 2024 |access-date=April 26, 2024 |website=[[BlackPast.org]]}}</ref> Meanwhile, in 1851, he merged the ''North Star'' with [[Gerrit Smith]]'s Liberty Party paper to form ''Frederick Douglass' Paper'',<ref>Blight, David W., ''Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom'', p. 213.</ref> which was published until 1859.<ref>[https://nyheritage.org/collections/frederick-douglass-paper Frederick Douglass' Paper]</ref>

On July 5, 1852, Douglass delivered an address in  [[Corinthian Hall (Rochester, New York)|Corinthian Hall]] at a meeting organized by the Rochester Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society. This speech eventually became known as "[[What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?]]"; one biographer called it "perhaps the greatest antislavery oration ever given."<ref>{{Cite book |last=McFeely |first=William S. |author-link=William S.

Douglass was one of five people whose names were attached to the address of the convention to the people of the United States published under the title, ''The Claims of Our Common Cause''. The other four were [[Amos Noë Freeman]], [[James Monroe Whitfield]], [[Henry O. Wagoner]], and [[George Boyer Vashon]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Douglass |first=Frederick |url=https://archive.org/details/frederickdouglas00fred |title=Frederick Douglass: Selected Speeches and Writings |date=1999 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=978-1-55652-349-6 |editor-last=Foner |editor-first=Philip S. |editor-link=Philip Foner |location=Chicago |pages=[https://archive.org/details/frederickdouglas00fred/page/260/mode/2up 260]–271 |editor-last2=Taylor |editor-first2=Yuval |url-access=registration}}</ref>

Like many abolitionists, Douglass believed that education would be crucial for African Americans to improve their lives; he was an early advocate for [[School integration in the United States|school desegregation]]. In the 1850s, Douglass observed that New York's facilities and instruction for African American children were vastly inferior to those for European Americans. Douglass called for court action to open all schools to all children. He said that full inclusion within the educational system was a more pressing need for African Americans than political issues such as suffrage.

===John Brown===
[[File:Douglass argued against John Brown's plan to attack the arsenal at Harpers Ferry - NARA - 559102.jpg|thumb|''Douglass argued against John Brown's plan to attack the arsenal at Harpers Ferry'', painting by [[Jacob Lawrence]]]]
{{see also|Shields Green}}
On March 12, 1859, Douglass met with radical abolitionists [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], [[George DeBaptiste]], and others at William Webb's house in Detroit to discuss emancipation.<ref>''9Underground Railroad'', US Department of Interior, National Park Service, Denver Service Center. Diane Publishing, 1995, p. 168. {{ISBN?}}</ref> Douglass met Brown again when Brown visited his home two months before leading [[John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry|the raid on Harpers Ferry]]. Brown penned his [[John Brown's Provisional Constitution|Provisional Constitution]] during his two-week stay with Douglass. Also staying with Douglass for over a year was [[Shields Green]], a fugitive slave whom Douglass was helping, as he often did.

Shortly before the raid, Douglass, taking Green with him, travelled from Rochester, via New York City, to [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]], Brown's communications headquarters. He was recognized there by black people, who asked him for a lecture. Douglass agreed, although he said his only topic was slavery. Green joined him on the stage; Brown, [[wikt:incognito|incognito]], sat in the audience. A white reporter, referring to "Nigger Democracy", called it a "flaming address" by "the notorious Negro Orator".<ref>{{Cite news |date=August 24, 1859 |title=High Treason! |page=5 |work=Franklin Repository |location=[[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]] |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/74855203/lecture-by-frederick-douglass/ |url-status=live |access-date=April 1, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413201002/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/74855203/lecture-by-frederick-douglass/ |archive-date=April 13, 2021 |via=[[newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

There, in an abandoned stone quarry for secrecy, Douglass and Green met with Brown and [[John Henri Kagi]], to discuss the raid. After discussions lasting, as Douglass put it, "a day and a night", he disappointed Brown by declining to join him, considering the mission suicidal. To Douglass's surprise, Green went with Brown instead of returning to Rochester with Douglass. Anne Brown said that Green told her that Douglass promised to pay him on his return, but [[David Blight]] called this "much more ex post facto bitterness than reality".<ref>{{Cite book |last=DeCaro |first=Louis A. Jr. |title=The Untold Story of Shields Green: The Life and Death of a Harper's Ferry Raider |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |year=2020 |isbn=978-1-4798-0275-3 |pages=172–174}}</ref>

Almost all that is known about this incident comes from Douglass. It is clear that it was of immense importance to him, both as a turning point in his life—not accompanying John Brown—and its importance in his public image. The meeting was not revealed by Douglass for 20 years. He first disclosed it in his speech on John Brown at [[Storer College]] in 1881, trying unsuccessfully to raise money to support a John Brown professorship at Storer, to be held by a black man. He again referred to it stunningly in his last ''Autobiography''.

After the raid, which took place between October 16 and 18, 1859, Douglass was accused both of supporting Brown and of not supporting him enough.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=1995 |title=His Soul Goes Marching On.

Douglass and the abolitionists argued that because the aim of the Civil War was to end slavery, African Americans should be allowed to engage in the fight for their freedom. Douglass publicized this view in his newspapers and several speeches. After Lincoln had finally allowed black soldiers to serve in the Union army, Douglass helped the recruitment efforts, publishing his famous broadside ''Men of Color to Arms!'' on March 21, 1863.<ref>{{cite book |last=Blight |first=David W. |title=Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-4165-9031-6 |location=New York |author-link=David W.

President Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which took effect on January 1, 1863, declared the freedom of all slaves in Confederate-held territory. (Slaves in Union-held areas were not covered because the proclamation was permissible under the Constitution only as a war measure; they were freed with the adoption of the 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.) Douglass described the spirit of those awaiting the proclamation: "We were waiting and listening as for a bolt from the sky ... we were watching ... by the dim light of the stars for the dawn of a new day ... we were longing for the answer to the agonizing prayers of centuries."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Fight For Emancipation |url=http://www.history.rochester.edu/class/douglass/part4.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708000612/http://www.history.rochester.edu/class/douglass/part4.html |archive-date=July 8, 2009 |access-date=April 19, 2007}}</ref>

During the [[1864 United States presidential election|U.S. Presidential Election of 1864]], Douglass supported [[John C. Frémont#Presidential candidate Radical Democracy Party 1864|John C. Frémont]], who was the candidate of the abolitionist [[Radical Democracy Party (United States)|Radical Democracy Party]]. Douglass was disappointed that President Lincoln did not publicly endorse suffrage for black freedmen. Douglass believed that since African American men were fighting for the Union in the American Civil War, they deserved the right to vote.<ref>Stauffer (2008), ''Giants'', p. 280.</ref>

===After Lincoln's death===
The postwar ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]], on December 6, 1865, outlawed slavery, "except as a punishment for crime." The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] provided for birthright citizenship and prohibited the states from abridging the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States or denying any "person" due process of law or equal protection of the laws. The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] protected all citizens from being discriminated against in voting because of race.<ref name="DouglassO">{{Cite book |last1=Frederick Douglass |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVIwdPfWvjMC&pg=PR11 |title=Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, an American slave |last2=Robert G.

[[File:Emancipation statue at Lincoln Park (14131873).jpg|thumb|upright|The keynote speaker at the unveiling of the [[Emancipation Memorial]], Douglass wrote a critique of the depiction of the black man "still on his knees".]]
On April 14, 1876, Douglass delivered the keynote speech at the unveiling of the [[Emancipation Memorial]] in Washington's Lincoln Park. He spoke frankly about the complex legacy of Lincoln, noting what he perceived as both positive and negative attributes of the late President.<ref name="Speech"/> Calling Lincoln "the white man's President," Douglass criticized Lincoln's tardiness in joining the cause of emancipation, noting that Lincoln initially opposed the expansion of slavery but did not support its elimination: "He had been ready and willing at any time during the first years of his administration to deny, postpone, and sacrifice the humanity of the colored people to promote the welfare of the white people. Lincoln was neither our man or our model".<ref name="Speech">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/06/27/emancipation-monument-in-washington-dc-targeted-by-protests/ |title=Frederick Douglass delivered a Lincoln reality check at Emancipation Memorial unveiling |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 27, 2020 |access-date=September 23, 2023|author=DeNeen L.

Most famously, he added: "Viewed from the genuine abolition ground, Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy, cold, dull, and indifferent; but measuring him by the sentiment of his country, a sentiment he was bound as a statesman to consult, he was swift, zealous, radical, and determined."<ref name="Speech"/>

The crowd, roused by his speech, gave Douglass a standing ovation. Lincoln's widow [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Lincoln]] supposedly gave Lincoln's favorite [[walking-stick]] to Douglass in appreciation. That walking stick still rests in his final residence, "Cedar Hill" in Washington, D.C., now preserved as the [[Frederick Douglass National Historic Site]].

After delivering the speech, Douglass immediately wrote to the National Republican newspaper in Washington (which published his letter five days later, on April 19), criticizing the statue's design and suggesting the park could be improved by more dignified monuments of free black people. "The negro here, though rising, is still on his knees and nude," Douglass wrote. "What I want to see before I die is a monument representing the negro, not couchant on his knees like a four-footed animal, but erect on his feet like a man."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mann |first=Ted |date=July 4, 2020 |title=How a Lincoln-Douglass Debate Led to Historic Discovery: Texting exchange by two professors led to Frederick Douglass letter on Emancipation Memorial |work=wsj.com |publisher=Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-lincoln-douglass-debate-led-to-historic-discovery-11593869400 |url-status=live |access-date=July 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200704155204/https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-lincoln-douglass-debate-led-to-historic-discovery-11593869400 |archive-date=July 4, 2020}}</ref>

==Reconstruction era==
[[File:George Kendall Warren - Frederick Douglass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Frederick Douglass in 1876, around 58 years of age]]

After the Civil War, Douglass continued to work for equality for African Americans and women. Due to his prominence and activism during the war, Douglass received several political appointments. He served as president of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era [[Freedman's Savings Bank]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=McFeely |first=William S. |author-link=William S.

Meanwhile, white insurgents had quickly arisen in the South after the war, organizing first as secret [[vigilante]] groups, including the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Armed insurgency took different forms. Powerful paramilitary groups included the [[White League]] and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], both active during the 1870s in the Deep South. They operated as "the military arm of the Democratic Party", turning out Republican officeholders and disrupting elections.<ref>[[George C. Rable]], ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132.</ref> Starting 10 years after the war, Democrats regained political power in every state of the former Confederacy and began to reassert [[white supremacy]]. They enforced this by a combination of violence, late 19th-century laws imposing [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] and a concerted effort to [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disfranchise]] African Americans. New labor and criminal laws also limited their freedom.<ref>[[Richard Pildes|Richard H. Pildes]], [https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731 "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121211213/https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731|date=November 21, 2018}}, ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, pp. 12–13. Retrieved March 10, 2008.</ref>

To combat these efforts, Douglass supported the presidential campaign of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in [[1868 United States presidential election|1868]]. In 1870, Douglass started his last newspaper, the ''[[New National Era]]'', attempting to hold his country to its commitment to equality.<ref name="pbs.org" /> President Grant sent a congressionally sponsored commission, accompanied by Douglass, on a mission to the West Indies to investigate whether the annexation of Santo Domingo would be good for the United States. Grant believed annexation would help relieve the violent situation in the South by allowing African Americans their own state. Douglass and the commission favored annexation, but Congress remained opposed to annexation. Douglass criticized Senator [[Charles Sumner]], who opposed annexation, stating that if Sumner continued to oppose annexation he would "regard him as the worst foe the colored race has on this continent."<ref>Brands (2012), ''The Man Who Saved the Union: Ulysses Grant in War and Peace'', p. 462.</ref>

[[File:2000-2008 17th Street, NW.JPG|thumb|Douglass's former residence in the [[U Street Corridor]] of Washington, D.C. He built 2000–2004 17th Street, [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]], in 1875.]]

After the midterm elections, Grant signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] (also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act) and the second and third [[Enforcement Acts]]. Grant used their provisions vigorously, suspending ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in South Carolina and sending troops there and into other states. Under his leadership over 5,000 arrests were made. Grant's vigor in disrupting the Klan made him unpopular among many whites but earned praise from Douglass. A Douglass associate wrote that African Americans "will ever cherish a grateful remembrance of [Grant's] name, fame and great services."

In 1872, Douglass became the first African American nominated for Vice President of the United States, as [[Victoria Woodhull]]'s running mate on the [[National Equal Rights Party|Equal Rights Party]] ticket. He was nominated without his knowledge. Douglass neither campaigned for the ticket nor acknowledged that he had been nominated.<ref name="VP">{{Cite book |last=Trotman |first=C.

However, in early June of that year, Douglass's third Rochester home, on South Avenue, burned down; arson was suspected. There was extensive damage to the house, its furnishings, and the grounds; in addition, sixteen volumes of the ''North Star'' and ''Frederick Douglass' Paper'' were lost.

Throughout the Reconstruction era, Douglass continued speaking, emphasizing the importance of work, voting rights and actual exercise of suffrage. His speeches for the twenty-five years following the war emphasized work to counter the racism that was then prevalent in unions.<ref>Olasky, Marvin. "History turned right side up".

==Frederick Douglass House==

In 1877 Frederick Douglass bought a house that included a big yard, as well as a studio where he did most of his work; he lived in this house from 1878 until his death in 1895, and it was named the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site.

In 1877, Douglass visited his former enslaver Thomas Auld on his deathbed, and the two men reconciled. Douglass had met Auld's daughter, Amanda Auld Sears, some years prior. She had requested the meeting and had subsequently attended and cheered one of Douglass's speeches. Her father complimented her for reaching out to Douglass. The visit also appears to have brought closure to Douglass, although some criticized his effort.<ref name="Finkelman2006-105" />

That same year, Douglass bought the house that was to be the family's final home in Washington, D.C., on a hill above the [[Anacostia River]]. He and Anna named it ''Cedar Hill'' (also spelled ''CedarHill''). They expanded the house from 14 to 21 rooms and included a china closet. One year later, Douglass purchased adjoining lots and expanded the property to 15&nbsp;acres (61,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>). The home is now preserved as the [[Frederick Douglass National Historic Site]].

In 1881, Douglass published the final edition of his autobiography, ''The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass'', which he updated in 1892. In 1881, he was appointed [[Recorder of Deeds]] for the District of Columbia. His wife Anna Murray Douglass died in 1882, leaving the widower devastated. After a period of mourning, Douglass found new meaning from working with activist [[Ida B. Wells]]. He remarried in 1884, as mentioned above.

Douglass also continued his speaking engagements and travel, both in the United States and abroad. With new wife Helen, Douglass toured the UK<ref name="Wilson2019">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Jen |title=Freedom Music: Wales, Emancipation and Jazz 1850-1950 |year=2019 |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=978-1-78683-408-9 |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48ObDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA72}}</ref> including Wales (possibly by invitation from abolitionist [[Jessie Donaldson]]), Ireland, France, Italy, Egypt, and Greece from 1886 to 1887.

Many African Americans, called [[Exoduster]]s,{{cn|date=September 2024}} escaped the Klan and racially discriminatory laws in the South by moving to [[Kansas]], where some formed all-black towns to have a greater level of freedom and autonomy. Douglass favored neither this nor the [[Back-to-Africa movement]]. He thought the latter resembled the [[American Colonization Society]], which he had opposed in his youth. In 1892, at an Indianapolis conference convened by Bishop [[Henry McNeal Turner]], Douglass spoke out against the separatist movements, urging African Americans to stick it out.<ref name="pbs.org" /> He made similar speeches as early as 1879 and was criticized both by fellow leaders and some audiences, who even booed him for this position.<ref>{{Cite book |last=McFeely |first=William S. |author-link=William S.

The complex still exists, and in 2003 was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{NRISref|2008a|dateform=dmy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=November 21, 2008 |title=Maryland Historical Trust |url={{MHT url|id=764}} |website=Douglass Place, Baltimore City |publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}</ref>

On February 20, 1895, Douglass attended a meeting of the National Council of Women in Washington, D.C. During that meeting, he was brought to the platform and received a standing ovation. Shortly after he returned home, Douglass died of a heart attack.<ref name="frederick-douglass-heritage.org">{{cite web |title=Later Years and Death |url=http://www.frederick-douglass-heritage.org/later-years-death/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221122559/http://www.frederick-douglass-heritage.org/later-years-death/ |archive-date=December 21, 2020 |access-date=September 21, 2017 |website=Frederick Douglass Heritage}}</ref> He was 77.

His funeral was held at the [[Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church]].   Although Douglass had attended several churches in the nation's capital, he had a pew here and had donated two standing candelabras when this church had moved to a new building in 1886. He also gave many lectures there, including his last major speech, "The Lesson of the Hour."<ref name="religionnews.com" />

Thousands of people passed by his coffin to show their respect. United States senators and Supreme Court justices were [[pallbearer]]s. [[Jeremiah Rankin]], President of [[Howard University]], delivered "a masterly address". A letter from [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] was read. The Secretary of the Haitian Legation "expressed the condolence of his country in melodious French."<ref>{{cite news

This raised Douglass's spirits considerably after he had faced an onslaught of "rotten eggs and all manner of stones and brickbats" while speaking a few weeks earlier in the courthouse at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite book|author=David W.

<blockquote>The most influential African American of the nineteenth century, Douglass made a career of agitating the American conscience. He spoke and wrote on behalf of a variety of reform causes: women's rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African Americans must play a conspicuous role in that struggle. Less than a month before his death, when a young black man solicited his advice to an African American just starting out in the world, Douglass replied without hesitation: ″Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!″</blockquote>

* In 1938–39, African-American artist [[Jacob Lawrence]] created ''The Frederick Douglass'' series of narrative paintings.
