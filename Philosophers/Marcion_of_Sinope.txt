==Life==
{{Gnosticism}}
[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] records in his {{transliteration|grc|[[Panarion]]}} (c. 375) that Marcion was born the son of a bishop in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] (modern-day Turkey), likely [[Philologus of Sinope]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Gospel of Marcion|url=http://gnosis.org/library/marcion.htm|access-date=2021-08-15|website=gnosis.org}}</ref> [[Rhodo]] and [[Tertullian]], young men in Marcion's old age, described him as a "mariner" and a "ship-master" respectively. Some time in the late 130s, Marcion traveled to Rome, joined the Roman church, and made a large donation of 200,000 [[Sestertius|sesterces]] to the congregation there.{{sfn|Harnack|1921|p=17}}{{sfn|Knox|1942|p=5}} Conflicts with the church of Rome arose and he was eventually [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] in 144, his donation being returned to him.{{sfn|Harnack|1921|p=18}}

[[Irenaeus]] writes that "a certain Cerdo, originating from the Simonians, came to Rome under [[Pope Hyginus|Hyginus]] [...] and taught that the one who was proclaimed as God by the Law and the Prophets is not the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (''[[Against Heresies]]'', 1, 27, 1). Also, according to them, Marcion and the Gnostic [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] were companions in Rome.<ref>Bernard Green, ''Christianity in Ancient Rome: The First Three Centuries''</ref>

In 394, Epiphanius claimed that after beginnings as an [[ascetic]], Marcion seduced a [[virgin]] and was accordingly excommunicated by his father, prompting him to leave his home town.<ref>''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'', XLII, ii.</ref> Some scholars have taken this  "seduction of a virgin" as a metaphor for Marcion's corruption of the Christian Church, with the Church portrayed as the undefiled virgin,<ref>[[Bart D. Ehrman]], ''Lost Christianities'' Conf. Beyschlag, Karlmann. "Herkunft und Eigenart der Papiasfragmente." Pages 268–80 in Studia Patristica 4: Papers Presented to the 3rd International Conference on Patristic Studies at Christ Church, Oxford, 21–26 September 1959. Edited by Frank L. Cross. TU 79. Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1961, p. 276</ref> and that Marcion apparently has become "the victim of the historicisation of such a metaphor, even though it contradicts the otherwise firm tradition of his strict sexual probity".<ref>{{cite book |last=Lieu |first=Judith M |title=Marcion and the Making of a Heretic. God and Scripture in the Second Century |publisher=Cambridge |date=2015}}</ref>{{rp|102}} Doubtful is Tertullian's claim in ''The Prescription Against Heretics'' (written {{c.|200}}) that Marcion professed repentance, and agreed to the conditions granted to him — that he should receive reconciliation if he restored to the Church those whom he had led astray — but that he was prevented from doing so by his death.<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf03/anf03-24.htm#P3125_1133921 ''The Prescription Against Heretics''] 30:3.

==Marcionite Church==
{{distinguish|Maronite Church}}
The Marcionite church expanded greatly within Marcion's lifetime, becoming a major rival to the [[History of early Christianity|other emerging church]]. After his death, it retained its following and survived Christian controversy and imperial disapproval for several centuries.<ref>Evans 1972 p. ix</ref> Several theologians have viewed him as a proto-protestant.<ref name="Welchman 2014 p. 21">{{cite book | last=Welchman | first=A. | title=Politics of Religion/Religions of Politics | publisher=Springer Netherlands | series=Sophia Studies in Cross-cultural Philosophy of Traditions and Cultures | year=2014 | isbn=978-94-017-9448-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8zlBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA21 | access-date=2023-06-11 | page=21}}</ref>

== Teachings ==
{{Main|Marcionism|Gospel of Marcion}}
{{See also|Priority of the Gospel of Marcion}}

Study of the [[Hebrew Bible]], along with received writings circulating in the nascent Church, led Marcion to conclude that many of the [[ministry of Jesus|teachings of Jesus]] were incompatible with the actions of [[Yahweh]], characterized as the belligerent god of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Marcion responded by developing a [[Dualistic cosmology|ditheistic]] system of belief around the year 144.{{NoteTag|115 years and six months from the [[Crucifixion]], according to [[Tertullian]]'s reckoning in {{lang|la|Adversus Marcionem}}, xv.}} This notion of two gods—a higher transcendent one and a lower world-creator and ruler—allowed Marcion to reconcile his perceived contradictions between Christian [[Covenant theology]] and [[the gospel]] proclaimed by the [[New Testament]].

In contrast to other leaders of the nascent Christian Church, however, Marcion declared that Christianity was in complete discontinuity with [[Judaism]] and entirely opposed to the scriptures of Judaism. Marcion did not claim that these were false. Instead, he asserted that they were entirely true, but were to be read in an absolutely literalistic manner, one which led him to develop an understanding that Yahweh was not the same God spoken of by Jesus. For example, Marcion argued that the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] account of Yahweh walking through the [[Garden of Eden]] asking where Adam was, proved that Yahweh inhabited a physical body and was without [[omniscience|universal knowledge]], attributes wholly incompatible with the Heavenly Father professed by Jesus.

According to Marcion, the god of the [[Old Testament]], whom he called the [[Demiurge]], the [[Creator deity|creator]] of the material [[universe]], is a jealous [[National god|tribal deity]] of the [[Jews]], whose [[Torah|law]] represents [[legalism (theology)|legalistic]] [[eye for an eye|reciprocal justice]] and who punishes mankind for its sins through suffering and death. In contrast, the God that Jesus professed is an altogether different being, a universal God of compassion and love who looks upon humanity with benevolence and mercy. Marcion also produced a book titled ''Antitheses'', which is no longer extant,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Badiou |first=Alain |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51093150 |title=Saint Paul : the foundation of universalism |date=2003 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=0-8047-4470-X |location=Stanford, Calif. |pages=35 |oclc=51093150 |author-link=Alain Badiou}}</ref> contrasting the Demiurge of the Old Testament with the Heavenly Father of the New Testament.

Marcion held Jesus to be the son of the Heavenly Father but understood the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] in a [[Docetism|docetic]] manner, i.e. that Jesus' body was only an imitation of a material body, and consequently denied Jesus' physical and bodily birth, death, and resurrection.

Marcion was the first to codify a Christian [[Development of the New Testament canon#Marcion of Sinope|canon]]. His canon consisted of only eleven books, grouped into two sections: the {{transliteration|grc|[[Gospel of Marcion|Evangelikon]]}}, a shorter version of the Gospel of Luke, and the {{transliteration|grc|[[Apostolikon]]}}, a selection of ten epistles of Paul the Apostle, which were also slightly shorter than the canonical text. Early Christians such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Epiphanius claimed that Marcion's editions of Luke and the Pauline epistles were intentionally edited by Marcion to match his theological views, and many modern scholars agree.<ref name="Wilkinson2015">{{cite book|author=Robert J. Wilkinson|title=Tetragrammaton: Western Christians and the Hebrew Name of God: From the Beginnings to the Seventeenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xyoBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA120|date=5 February 2015|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-28817-1|pages=120–}}</ref> However, some scholars argue that Marcion's texts were not substantially edited by him, and may in some respects represent an earlier version of these texts than the canonical versions.{{sfn|BeDuhn|2015|p=165}}{{sfn|Klinghardt|2008|p=6-10}}{{sfn|Knox|1942|p=164ff}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|1984}} Like the [[Gospel of Mark]], the gospel used by Marcion did not contain elements relating to his [[nativity of Jesus|birth]] and childhood. Interestingly, it did contain some Jewish elements, and material that challenged Marcion's ditheism—a fact that was exploited by early Christians in their polemics against Marcion.{{sfn|Klinghardt|2008|p=7}}

The centrality of the Pauline epistles in Marcion's canon reflects the fact that Marcion considered Paul to be the correct interpreter and transmitter of Jesus' teachings, in contrast to the Twelve Disciples and the early Jerusalem church.{{sfn|Knox|1942|p=7}} In Marcion's view, the other apostles were under the auspices of the Demiurge.<ref name=":0" />

==Gnosticism==
Marcion is sometimes described as a [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] philosopher. In some essential respects, Marcion proposed ideas which aligned well with Gnostic thought. Like the Gnostics, he believed that Jesus was essentially a divine spirit who appeared to human beings in human form, but did not actually take on a fleshly human body.{{sfn|Knox|1942|p=7}}

However, Marcionism conceptualizes God in a way which cannot be reconciled with broader Gnostic thought. For Gnostics, some human beings are born with a small piece of God's soul lodged within their spirit (akin to the notion of a [[Divine Spark]]).{{sfn|Harnack|1900|pp=vol. I, &nbsp;267&ndash;313; vol. II, &nbsp;1&ndash;19}} God is thus intimately connected to and part of his creation. Salvation lies in turning away from the physical world (which Gnostics regard as an illusion) and embracing the godlike qualities within oneself. Marcion, by contrast, held that the Heavenly Father (the father of Jesus Christ) was an utterly alien God; he had no part in making the world, nor any connection with it.{{sfn|Harnack|1900|pp=vol. I, &nbsp;267&ndash;313; vol. II, &nbsp;1&ndash;19}} According to [[Bart Ehrman]]: "Marcion himself should not be thought of as a Gnostic; he held that there were only [[Dualism in cosmology|two gods]], not many; he did not think of this world as a cosmic disaster, but as the creation of the Old Testament God; and he did not think divine sparks resided in human bodies that could be set free by understanding the true 'gnosis.' Moreover, his [[docetic]] view does not appear to have been the typical view of Gnostics."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|title=How Jesus Became God: The Exaltation of a Jewish Preacher from Galilee|date=2014-03-25|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-225219-7|language=en|chapter=Chapter 8.
