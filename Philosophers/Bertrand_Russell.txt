Russell had two siblings: brother [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell|Frank]] (seven years older), and sister Rachel (four years older). In June 1874, Russell's mother died of [[diphtheria]], followed shortly by Rachel's death.

His grandfather, former Prime Minister [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Earl Russell]], died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kind old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the [[Frances Russell, Countess Russell|Countess Russell]] (née Lady Frances Elliot), was the central family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.<ref name="Gallery" /><ref name="calicut" />

The Countess was from a Scottish [[Presbyterian]] family and petitioned the [[Court of Chancery]] to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting [[Darwinism]] and supporting [[Home Rule|Irish Home Rule]]), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on [[social justice]] and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life. Her favourite Bible verse, "Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil",<ref>{{Bibleverse |Exodus |23:2 |KJV}}</ref> became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.

Russell's adolescence was lonely and he contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his interests in "nature and books and (later) mathematics saved me from complete despondency;"<ref>''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell'' (Volume I, 1872–1914) George Allen and Unwin Ltd., 1971, page 31;</ref> only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bertrand Russell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC |title=Autobiography |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-415-18985-9 |page=38 |access-date=7 January 2016 |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910140331/https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC |url-status=live }}</ref> He was educated at home by a series of tutors.<ref name="nobel prize">The Nobel Foundation (1950).

During these formative years, he also discovered the works of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]].

===Education===
[[File:Portrait of Bertrand Russell in 1893.jpg|thumb|upright|Russell at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in 1893]]

Russell won a scholarship to read for the [[Mathematical Tripos]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and began his studies there in 1890,<ref>{{acad |id=RSL890BA|name=Russell, the Hon. Bertrand Arthur William}}</ref> taking as coach [[Robert Rumsey Webb]]. He became acquainted with the younger [[George Edward Moore]] and came under the influence of [[Alfred North Whitehead]], who recommended him to the [[Cambridge Apostles]].

===Early career===
{{see also|Axiom of reducibility}}
Russell began his published work in 1896 with ''German Social Democracy'', a study in politics that was an early indication of his interest in political and social theory. In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the [[London School of Economics]].<ref name="LSE">{{Cite web |date=26 August 2015 |title=London School of Economics |url=https://www.lse.ac.uk/aboutLSE/keyFacts/nobelPrizeWinners/russell.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015192808/https://www.lse.ac.uk/aboutLSE/keyFacts/nobelPrizeWinners/russell.aspx |archive-date=15 October 2014 |publisher=London School of Economics}}</ref> He was a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].<ref name="LettersPg16">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EayyTTpXL-QC&pg=PA16 |title=Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell: Letters to the Editor 1904–1969 |publisher=Open Court Publishing |year=2001 |isbn=0-8126-9449-X |editor-last=Ray Perkins |location=Chicago |page=16 |access-date=16 November 2007}}</ref>

He now started a study of the [[foundations of mathematics]] at Trinity. In 1897, he wrote ''An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry'' (submitted at the [[Fellow]]ship Examination of Trinity College) which discussed the [[Cayley–Klein metric]]s used for [[non-Euclidean geometry]].<ref>Russell, Bertrand (1897) ''An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry'', p. 32, re-issued 1956 by [[Dover Books]]</ref> He attended the first [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in Paris in 1900 where he met [[Giuseppe Peano]] and [[Alessandro Padoa]]. The Italians had responded to [[Georg Cantor]], making a science of [[set theory]]; they gave Russell their literature including the ''[[Formulario mathematico]]''. Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon [[Russell's paradox]]. In 1903 he published ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'', a work on the foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of [[logicism]], that mathematics and logic are one and the same.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bertrand Russell, biography |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1950/russell-bio.html |access-date=23 June 2010 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |archive-date=4 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604131349/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1950/russell-bio.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

At the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a "sort of mystic illumination", after witnessing [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s wife's suffering in an [[Angina pectoris|angina]] attack. "I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty and with a desire almost as profound as that of the [[Buddha]] to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable", Russell would later recall. "At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bertrand Russell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC |title=Autobiography |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-415-18985-9 |chapter=6: Principia Mathematica |access-date=7 January 2016 |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910140331/https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1905, he wrote the essay "[[On Denoting]]", which was published in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''. Russell was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1908|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1908]].<ref name="frs" /><ref name="Gallery" /> The three-volume ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', written with Whitehead, was published between 1910 and 1913. This, along with the earlier ''The Principles of Mathematics'', soon made Russell world-famous in his field. Russell's first political activity was as the [[Independent Liberal]] candidate in the [[1907 Wimbledon by-election|1907 by-election]] for the [[Wimbledon (UK Parliament constituency)|Wimbledon constituency]], where he was not elected.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Craig|editor1-first=F. W. S.|title=British Parliamentary Election Results: 1885–1918|date=1974|publisher=Macmillan Press|location=London|isbn=9781349022984}}</ref>

In 1910, he became a lecturer at the [[University of Cambridge]], Trinity College, where he had studied. He was considered for a fellowship, which would give him a vote in the college government and protect him from being fired for his opinions, but was passed over because he was "anti-clerical", because he was agnostic. He was approached by the Austrian engineering student [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who became his PhD student. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various [[phobia]]s and his bouts of despair. This was a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' in 1922.<ref name="Wittgenstein">{{Cite web |title=Russell on Wittgenstein |url=http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/history/rvw001.htm |access-date=1 October 2011 |website=Rbjones.com}}</ref> Russell delivered his lectures on [[logical atomism]], his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of [[World War I]]. Wittgenstein was, at that time, serving in the Austrian Army and subsequently spent nine months in an Italian [[prisoner of war]] camp at the end of the conflict.

===First World War===

During [[World War I]], Russell was one of the few people to engage in active [[opposition to World War I|pacifist activities]]. In 1916, because of his lack of a fellowship, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |year=2011 |title=I Tried to Stop the Bloody Thing |work=The American Scholar |url=http://www.theamericanscholar.org/i-tried-to-stop-the-bloody-thing/ |access-date=10 May 2011 |archive-date=7 September 2013 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130907013508/http://theamericanscholar.org/i-tried-to-stop-the-bloody-thing/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He later described this, in ''[[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]]'', as an illegitimate means the state used to violate freedom of expression.

After the event, Russell told Lady Ottoline Morrell that, "to my surprise, when I got up to speak, I was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=Pacifism and Revolution |publisher=Routledge |year=1995 |page=xxxiv |chapter=A Summer of Hope}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=5 June 1917 |title=British Socialists – Peace Terms Discussed |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15731745 |access-date=7 January 2014 |website=The Sydney Morning Herald |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910140359/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/15731745 |url-status=live }}</ref>

His conviction in 1916 resulted in Russell being fined £100 ({{Inflation|UK|100|1917|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=£}}), which he refused to pay in the hope that he would be sent to prison, but his books were sold at auction to raise the money. The books were bought by friends; he later treasured his copy of the [[King James Version|King James Bible]] that was stamped "Confiscated by Cambridge Police".

A later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the United States to enter the war on the United Kingdom's side resulted in six months' imprisonment in [[HM Prison Brixton|Brixton Prison]] (see ''[[Bertrand Russell's political views]]'') in 1918 (he was prosecuted under the [[Defence of the Realm Act]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://russell-letters.mcmaster.ca/background |title=The Brixton Letters |access-date=24 November 2023 |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910144113/https://russell-letters.mcmaster.ca/background |url-status=live }}</ref>)<ref name="Pacifist">{{Cite book |last=Vellacott |first=Jo |title=Bertrand Russell and the Pacifists in the First World War |publisher=Harvester Press |year=1980 |isbn=0-85527-454-9 |location=Brighton}}</ref> He later said of his imprisonment:

{{blockquote|I found prison in many ways quite agreeable. I had no engagements, no difficult decisions to make, no fear of callers, no interruptions to my work. I read enormously; I wrote a book, "Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy"... and began the work for "The Analysis of Mind".

While he was reading [[Lytton Strachey|Strachey]]'s ''[[Eminent Victorians]]'' chapter about [[Charles George Gordon|Gordon]] he laughed out loud in his cell prompting the warder to intervene and reminding him that "prison was a place of punishment".<ref>''The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell'' by Bertrand Russell, [[Nicholas Griffin (philosopher)|Nicholas Griffin]] 2002, letter to Gladys Rinder in May 1918</ref>

Russell was reinstated to Trinity in 1919, resigned in 1920, was Tarner Lecturer in 1926 and became a Fellow again in 1944 until 1949.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Trinity in Literature |url=https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/historical-overview/trinity-in-literature/ |access-date=3 August 2017 |publisher=Trinity College |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910140518/https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/historical-overview/trinity-in-literature/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1924, Russell again gained press attention when attending a "banquet" in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] with well-known campaigners, including [[Arnold Lupton]], who had been an [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] and had also endured imprisonment for "passive resistance to military or naval service".<ref>{{Cite news |date=8 January 1924 |title=M.

===G. H. Hardy on the Trinity controversy===
In 1941, [[G. H. Hardy]] wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled ''Bertrand Russell and Trinity'' – published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by [[C. D. Broad]]—in which he gave an authoritative account of Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life. Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision. The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing in October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one-year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in China and Japan. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was voluntary and was not the result of another altercation.

The reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage. Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it since this would have been an "unusual application" and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy. Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered with Russell's resignation since the 'world of learning' knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed. In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the ''Tarner Lectures'' on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best-received books according to Hardy: ''The Analysis of Matter'', published in 1927.<ref>{{Cite book |last=G. H. Hardy |title=Bertrand Russell and Trinity |year=1970 |pages=57–8}}</ref> In the preface to the Trinity pamphlet, Hardy wrote:
{{blockquote|I wish to make it plain that Russell himself is not responsible, directly or indirectly, for the writing of the pamphlet.... I wrote it without his knowledge and, when I sent him the typescript and asked for his permission to print it, I suggested that, unless it contained misstatement of fact, he should make no comment on it. He agreed to this... no word has been changed as the result of any suggestion from him.}}

===Between the wars===

===Second World War===
[[Bertrand Russell's political views|Russell's political views]] changed over time, mostly about war. He opposed rearmament against [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1937, he wrote in a personal letter: "If the Germans succeed in sending an invading army to England we should do best to treat them as visitors, give them quarters and invite the commander and chief to dine with the prime minister."<ref>{{Cite web |date=19 February 2014 |title=Museum Of Tolerance Acquires Bertrand Russell's Nazi Appeasement Letter |url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/02/19/museum-of-tolerance-acquires-bertrand-russells-nazi-appeasement-letter/ |access-date=29 March 2017 |website=Losangeles.cbslocal.com |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910140852/https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/museum-of-tolerance-acquires-bertrand-russells-nazi-appeasement-letter/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1940, he changed his [[appeasement]] view that avoiding a full-scale world war was more important than defeating Hitler. He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy. In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare called "relative political pacifism": "War was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils."<ref>Russell, Bertrand, "The Future of Pacifism", The American Scholar, (1943) 13: 7–13.</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Bertrand Russell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC |title=Autobiography |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-415-18985-9 |chapter=12: Later Years of Telegraph House |quote=I found the Nazis utterly revolting – cruel, bigoted, and stupid.

===Later life===

[[File:Bertrand Russell 1954.jpg|thumb|Russell in 1954]]
Russell participated in many broadcasts over the [[BBC]], particularly ''[[The Brains Trust]]'' and for the [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]], on various topical and philosophical subjects. By this time Russell was known outside academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer opinions on a variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in [[Trondheim]], Russell was one of 24 survivors (out of 43 passengers) of an [[Bukken Bruse disaster|aeroplane crash in Hommelvik]] in October 1948. He said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane.<ref name="letters">{{Cite book |title=The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-26012-4 |editor-last=Griffin, Nicholas |editor-link=Nicholas Griffin (philosopher) |page=660}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Bertrand Russell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC |title=Autobiograph y |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-415-18985-9 |page=512 |access-date=7 January 2016 |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910140331/https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) became a best-seller and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life.

In 1942, Russell argued in favour of a moderate [[socialism]], capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles. In an inquiry on [[dialectical materialism]], launched by the Austrian artist and philosopher [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in his journal ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'', Russell said: "I think the metaphysics of both [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]] plain nonsense—Marx's claim to be 'science' is no more justified than [[Mary Baker Eddy]]'s. This does not mean that I am opposed to socialism."<ref>Russell to Edward Renouf, assistant of [[Wolfgang Paalen]], 23 March 1942 (Succession Wolfgang Paalen, Berlin); this letter is cited in ''DYN'', No. 2, Mexico, July–August 1942, p. 52.</ref>

In 1943, Russell expressed support for [[Zionism]]: "I have come gradually to see that, in a dangerous and largely hostile world, it is essential to Jews to have some country which is theirs, some region where they are not suspected aliens, some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bertrand Russell On Zionism |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Quote/Russell_On_Zionism.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040128/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Quote/Russell_On_Zionism.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=13 September 2014}}</ref>

In a speech in 1948, Russell said that if the [[USSR]]'s aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] than before it possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atomic bombs on both sides.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bertrand Russell and Preventive War |url=http://www.plymouth.edu/department/history-philosophy/files/2012/10/Bertrand-Russell-and-Preventive-War.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305003733/http://www.plymouth.edu/department/history-philosophy/files/2012/10/Bertrand-Russell-and-Preventive-War.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2017 |access-date=29 March 2017 |website=Plymouth.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=21 July 2001 |title=A philosopher's letters – Love, Bertie |newspaper=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/books/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=699582 |access-date=5 August 2006 |archive-date=6 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206014335/http://www.economist.com/books/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=699582 |url-status=live }}</ref> At that time, only the United States possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an aggressive policy towards the countries in Eastern Europe which were being absorbed into the Soviet Union's [[sphere of influence]]. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first strike]] in a war with the USSR, including [[Nigel Lawson]], who was present when Russell spoke of such matters. Others, including [[Nicholas Griffin (philosopher)|Griffin]], who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.<ref name="letters" />

Just after the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], Russell wrote letters, and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948, stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the USSR using atomic bombs while the United States possessed them and before the USSR did.<ref name="clark">{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=Ronald William |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofbertrandru00clar |title=The life of Bertrand Russell|year=1976 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0394490595 |url-access=registration}}</ref> In September 1949, one week after the USSR tested its first A-bomb, but before this became known, Russell wrote that the USSR would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following Stalin's purges only science based on Marxist principles would be practised in the Soviet Union.<ref>He wrote: "There is reason to think Stalin will insist on a new orthodoxy in atomic physics, since there is much in quantum theory that runs contrary to Communist dogma. An atomic bomb' made on Marxist principles would probably not explode because, after all, Marxist science was that of a hundred years ago. For those who fear the military power of Russia there is, therefore, some reason to rejoice in the muzzling of Russian science."

Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to ''Words and Things'' by [[Ernest Gellner]], which was highly critical of the [[Philosophical Investigations|later thought]] of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and of [[ordinary language philosophy]]. [[Gilbert Ryle]] refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', which caused Russell to respond via ''[[The Times]]''. The result was a month-long correspondence in ''The Times'' between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy.<ref>T. P.

In 1950, Russell attended the inaugural conference for the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], a [[CIA]]-funded anti-communist organisation committed to the deployment of culture as a weapon during the [[Cold War]].<ref>Frances Stonor Saunders, "The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters."

In 1952, Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}} Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother). Russell married his fourth wife, [[Edith Finch Russell|Edith Finch]], soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, sharing a house for 20 years with Russell's old friend [[Lucy Donnelly]]. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son John suffered from [[mental illness]], which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and his former wife Dora.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

===Political causes===
{{Main|Political views of Bertrand Russell}}

Bertrand Russell was opposed to war from a young age; his opposition to World War I was used as grounds for his dismissal from Trinity College at Cambridge. This incident fused two of his controversial causes, as he had failed to be granted fellow status which would have protected him from firing, because he was not willing to either pretend to be a devout Christian, or at least avoid admitting he was agnostic.

He later described the resolution of these issues as essential to freedom of thought and expression, citing the incident in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]], where he explained that the expression of any idea, even the most obviously "bad", must be protected not only from direct State intervention but also economic leveraging and other means of being silenced:

Russell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to [[nuclear disarmament]] and opposing the [[Vietnam War]]. The 1955 [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]] was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time.<ref name="Manifesto">{{Cite web |last1=Russell, Bertrand |last2=Albert Einstein |author-link2=Albert Einstein |date=9 July 1955 |title=Russell Einstein Manifesto |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_russelleinstein_manif.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801154612/http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_russelleinstein_manif.html |archive-date=1 August 2009 |access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref> In October 1960 "[[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|The Committee of 100]]" was formed with a declaration by Russell and [[Michael Scott (priest)|Michael Scott]], entitled "Act or Perish", which called for a "movement of nonviolent resistance to nuclear war and weapons of mass destruction".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rethinkingsecurity.org.uk/2020/10/16/committee-of-100-and-extinction-rebellion/ |title=Nonviolent Direct Action: The Committee of 100 and Extinction Rebellion |date=16 October 2020 |access-date=24 November 2023 |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910144125/https://rethinkingsecurity.org.uk/2020/10/16/committee-of-100-and-extinction-rebellion/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In September 1961, at the age of 89, Russell was jailed for seven days in [[HM Prison Brixton|Brixton Prison]] for a "breach of the peace" after taking part in [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)#1961|an anti-nuclear demonstration]] in London.

From 1966 to 1967, Russell worked with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and many other intellectual figures to form the [[Russell Tribunal|Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal]] to investigate the conduct of the United States in Vietnam. He wrote many letters to world leaders during this period.

Early in his life, Russell supported [[eugenics|eugenicist]] policies. In 1894, he proposed that the state issue certificates of health to prospective parents and withhold public benefits from those considered unfit.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Griffin |first=Nicholas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hV7bHY0fTCoC&pg=PA125 |title=The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell: The Private Years, 1884–1914 |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-26014-5 |pages=588 |access-date=5 April 2021 |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910140918/https://books.google.com/books?id=hV7bHY0fTCoC&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1929, he wrote that people deemed "mentally defective" and "feebleminded" should be sexually sterilised because they "are apt to have enormous numbers of illegitimate children, all, as a rule, wholly useless to the community."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=Marriage and Morals |date=1929 |publisher=H.

I do not pretend that [[birth control]] is the only way in which population can be kept from increasing. There are others, which, one must suppose, opponents of birth control would prefer.

On 20 November 1948, in a public speech at [[Westminster School]], addressing a gathering arranged by the New Commonwealth, Russell shocked some observers by suggesting that a preemptive nuclear strike on the [[Soviet Union]] was justified. Russell argued that war between the United States and the Soviet Union seemed inevitable, so it would be a humanitarian gesture to get it over with quickly and have the United States in the dominant position. Currently, Russell argued, humanity could survive such a war, whereas a full [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] after both sides had manufactured large stockpiles of more destructive weapons was likely to result in the [[extinction]] of the [[Human|human race]]. Russell later relented from this stance, instead arguing for mutual disarmament by the nuclear powers.

In 1956, before and during the [[Suez Crisis]], Russell expressed his opposition to European imperialism in the Middle East. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of the pressing need for an effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty in places such as the [[Suez Canal]] area "where general interest is involved". At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets "because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating". Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which [[Michael Polanyi]] had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had entered [[Budapest]].<ref>''Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'' (Psychology Press, 2005)</ref>

In November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], urging a summit to consider "the conditions of co-existence". Khrushchev responded that peace could be served by such a meeting. In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in ''[[The Observer]]'', proposing a cessation of all nuclear weapons production, with the UK taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear weapons program if necessary, and with Germany "freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West". US Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] replied for Eisenhower. The exchange of letters was published as ''The Vital Letters of Russell, Khrushchev, and Dulles''.<ref name="ref1">''Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell'' (pp. 212–213).</ref>

Russell was asked by ''[[The New Republic]]'', a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace. He urged that all nuclear weapons testing and flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all [[hydrogen bombs]], with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power. He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the [[Oder-Neisse line]] as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in Central Europe, consisting at the minimum of Germany, Poland, Hungary, and [[Czechoslovakia]], with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone. In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing [[Arab nationalism]], and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard Israel's frontiers to ensure that Israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it. He also suggested Western recognition of the People's Republic of China, and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]].<ref name=ref1/>

He was in contact with [[Lionel Rogosin]] while the latter was filming his anti-war film ''[[Good Times, Wonderful Times]]'' in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the [[New Left]]. In early 1963, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the Vietnam War, and felt that the US government's policies there were near-[[genocidal]]. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the [[Jerusalem Prize]], an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society.<ref name="jerusalem prize">{{Cite web |title=Jerusalem International Book Fair |url=http://www.jerusalembookfair.com/main.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122165019/http://www.jerusalembookfair.com/main.html |archive-date=22 January 2008 |access-date=1 October 2011 |publisher=Jerusalembookfair.com}}</ref> In 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to Israel and the [[Arab world|Arab countries]] to accept an [[arms embargo]] and international supervision of [[nuclear plant]]s and rocket weaponry.<ref>{{Cite web |date=26 February 1964 |title=Bertrand Russell Appeals to Arabs and Israel on Rocket Weapons |url=http://www.jta.org/1964/02/26/archive/bertrand-russell-appeals-to-arabs-and-israel-on-rocket-weapons |publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |access-date=5 January 2014 |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910144140/https://www.jta.org/archive/bertrand-russell-appeals-to-arabs-and-israel-on-rocket-weapons |url-status=live }}</ref> In October 1965 he tore up his [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] card because he suspected [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government was going to send troops to support the United States in Vietnam.<ref name="Gallery" />

He made a [[cameo appearance]] playing himself in the anti-war [[Hindi]] film [[Aman (film)|''Aman'']], by [[Mohan Kumar (director)|Mohan Kumar]], which was released in India in 1967.

On 23 November 1969, he wrote to ''The Times'' newspaper saying that the preparation for show trials in Czechoslovakia was "highly alarming". The same month, he appealed to Secretary General [[U Thant]] of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the United States in [[South Vietnam]] during the Vietnam War. The following month, he protested to [[Alexei Kosygin]] over the expulsion of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] from the [[Soviet Union of Writers]].

On 31 January 1970, Russell issued a statement condemning "Israel's aggression in the Middle East", and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the [[War of Attrition]], which he compared to German bombing raids in the [[Battle of Britain]] and the US bombing of Vietnam. He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-[[Six-Day War]] borders, stating "The aggression committed by Israel must be condemned, not only because no state has the right to annexe foreign territory, but because every expansion is an experiment to discover how much more aggression the world will tolerate."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Siddiqui |first=M.

==Views==
{{Infobox Bertrand Russell}}

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Bertrand Russell's philosophical views}}
Russell is credited with being one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]]. He was impressed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716), and wrote on major areas of philosophy except [[aesthetics]]. He was prolific in the fields of [[metaphysics]], [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Logic and philosophy of mathematics|logic and the philosophy of mathematics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Philosophy of language|philosophy of language]], [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Ethics|ethics]] and [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Epistemology|epistemology]]. When [[Brand Blanshard]] asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, though he hastened to add "but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects".<ref>Blanshard, in [[Paul Arthur Schilpp]], ed., ''The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard'', Open Court, 1980, p. 88, quoting a private letter from Russell.</ref>

On ethics, Russell wrote that he was a [[utilitarian]] in his youth, yet he later distanced himself from this view.<ref>''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell'', London: Routledge, 2000 [London: Allen and Unwin, 1969, Vol. 1], p.&nbsp;39 ("It appeared to me obvious that the happiness of mankind should be the aim of all action, and I discovered to my surprise that there were those who thought otherwise. Belief in happiness, I found, was called Utilitarianism, and was merely one among a number of ethical theories. I adhered to it after this discovery, and was rash enough to tell my grandmother that I was a utilitarian." In a letter from 1902, in which Russell criticised utilitarianism, he wrote: "I may as well begin by confessing that for many years it seemed to me perfectly self-evident that pleasure is the only good and pain the only evil. Now, however, the opposite seems to me self-evident. This change has been brought about by what I may call moral experience." Ibid, p. 161).</ref>

For the advancement of science and protection of liberty of expression, Russell advocated [[The Will to Doubt]], the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess, that one should always remember:

{{blockquote|None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error. The methods of increasing the degree of truth in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate. These methods are practised in science, and have built up the body of scientific knowledge.

Every man of science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the progress of discovery; nevertheless, it is near enough to the truth to serve for most practical purposes, though not for all. In science, where alone something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found, men's attitude is tentative and full of doubt.<ref name="free" />}}

===Religion===
Russell described himself in 1947 as an agnostic or an [[atheism|atheist]]: he found it difficult to determine which term to adopt, saying:{{blockquote|Therefore, in regard to the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympic gods]], speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], I should, I think, take exactly the same line.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=1947 |title=Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic? |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Things |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm |access-date=6 July 2005 |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622001026/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm |archive-date=22 June 2005 |url-status=dead}}: "I never know whether I should say 'Agnostic' or whether I should say 'Atheist'.... As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove (sic) that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist."</ref>}} For most of his adult life, Russell maintained religion to be little more than [[superstition]] and, despite any positive effects, largely harmful to people. He believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency, and to be responsible for much of our world's wars, oppression, and misery. He was a member of the advisory council of the [[British Humanist Association]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=20th Century Humanism |url=https://humanists.uk/humanism/the-humanist-tradition/20th-century-humanism/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231206145444/https://humanists.uk/humanism/the-humanist-tradition/20th-century-humanism/ |archive-date=2023-12-06 |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=Humanists UK |language=en-GB}}</ref> and the president of Cardiff Humanists until his death.<ref>'Humanist News', March 1970{{Nonspecific|date=January 2020|reason=Journal, title, author?}}</ref>

===Society===
{{Main|Bertrand Russell's political views}}

Political and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes. He was a prominent campaigner against Western intervention into the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s, writing essays and books, attending demonstrations, and even organising the [[Russell Tribunal]] in 1966 alongside other prominent philosophers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]], which fed into his 1967 book ''War Crimes in Vietnam.''<ref>{{Cite web |title=War Crimes in Vietnam |url=https://nyupress.org/9780853450580/war-crimes-in-vietnam |access-date=12 May 2023 |website=NYU Press |language=en-US |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910144655/https://nyupress.org/9780853450580/war-crimes-in-vietnam/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Russell argued for a "scientific society", where war would be abolished, population growth would be limited, and prosperity would be shared.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Impact of Science on Society |publisher=New York, Columbia University Press |year=1952 |chapter=Conclusions |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/impactofscienceo0000russ |chapter-url-access=registration}}</ref> He suggested the establishment of a "single supreme world government" able to enforce peace,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=Which Way to Peace?

He was a liberal in that he opposed concentrations of power in all its manifestations, military, governmental, or religious, as well as the superstitious or nationalist ideas that usually serve as its justification. But he was also a socialist, even as an extension of his liberalism, because he was equally opposed to the concentrations of power stemming from the [[private ownership]] of the major [[means of production]], which therefore needed to be put under social control (which does not mean state control)."<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Bricmont |first1=Jean |last2=Norm |last3=Europe |first3=BaillargeonTopics: History Marxism Philosophy Socialism Places: Europe Soviet UnionWestern |date=1 July 2017 |title=Monthly Review {{!}} Bertrand Russell and the Socialism That Wasn't |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2017/07/01/bertrand-russell-and-the-socialism-that-wasnt/ |access-date=12 May 2023 |website=Monthly Review |language=en-US |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910144656/https://monthlyreview.org/2017/07/01/bertrand-russell-and-the-socialism-that-wasnt/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Russell was an active supporter of the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]], being one of the signatories of [[A. E. Dyson]]'s 1958 letter to ''The Times'' calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive.<ref name="GALHA">{{Cite web |last=Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association |date=2 November 1997 |title=Lesbian and Gay Rights: The Humanist and Religious Stances |url=http://www.galha.org/briefing/lgb_rights.html |access-date=17 February 2008 |archive-date=10 June 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020610084110/http://www.galha.org/briefing/lgb_rights.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

He expressed sympathy and support for the [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] people and was critical of [[Israel]]'s actions. He wrote in 1960 that, "I think it was a mistake to establish a Jewish State in Palestine, but it would be a still greater mistake to try to get rid of it now that it exists."<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Bertrand Russell Society Quarterly – November 2003 |url=https://www.lehman.edu/faculty/rcarey/BRSQ/03nov.russell.htm |access-date=12 May 2023 |website=www.lehman.edu |archive-date=10 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240910144727/https://www.lehman.edu/faculty/rcarey/BRSQ/03nov.russell.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> In his final written document, read aloud in [[Cairo]] three days after his death on 31 January 1970, he condemned Israel as an aggressive [[Imperialism|imperialist]] power, which "wishes to consolidate with the least difficulty what it has already taken by violence. Every new conquest becomes the new basis of the proposed negotiation from strength, which ignores the injustice of the previous aggression." In regards to the Palestinian people and [[Palestinian refugees|refugees]], he wrote that, "No people anywhere in the world would accept being expelled en masse from their own country; how can anyone require the people of Palestine to accept a punishment which nobody else would tolerate? A permanent just settlement of the refugees in their homeland is an essential ingredient of any genuine settlement in the [[Middle East]]."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Siddiqui |first=M.

[...] Stated in more familiar terms, the plan we are advocating amounts essentially to this: that a certain small income, sufficient for necessaries, should be secured to all, whether they work or not, and that a larger income – as much larger as might be warranted by the total amount of commodities produced – should be given to those who are willing to engage in some work which the community recognizes as useful...When education is finished, no one should be compelled to work, and those who choose not to work should receive a bare livelihood and be left completely free."<ref>{{Cite web |title=A short history of the Basic Income idea {{!}} BIEN — Basic Income Earth Network |url=https://basicincome.org/history/ |access-date=12 May 2023 |website=basicincome.org |date=22 January 2015 |archive-date=3 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230103180555/https://basicincome.org/history/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In "Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday" ("Postscript" in his ''Autobiography''), Russell wrote: "I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1944–1969 |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1968 |page=330}} Published separately as 'Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday' in ''Portraits from Memory''.</ref>

===Freedom of opinion and expression===
Russell supported freedom of opinion and was an opponent of both censorship and indoctrination. In 1928, he wrote: "The fundamental argument for freedom of opinion is the doubtfulness of all our belief... when the State intervenes to ensure the indoctrination of some doctrine, it does so because there is no conclusive evidence in favour of that doctrine ... It is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions make it impossible to make a living".<ref>''Skeptical Essays'', 1928, {{ISBN|978-0-415-32508-0}}</ref> In 1957, he wrote: "'Free thought' means thinking freely ... to be worthy of the name freethinker he must be free of two things: the force of tradition and the tyranny of his own passions."<ref>Understanding History and other Essays.</ref>

===Education===
Russell has presented ideas on the possible means of control of education in case of scientific dictatorship governments, of the kind of this excerpt taken from Chapter II "General Effects of Scientific Technique" of "The Impact of Science on society":<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Impact of Science on Society |publisher=New York, AMS Press |year=1953 |chapter=General Effects of Scientific Technique |chapter-url=https://it.scribd.com/document/558107312/The-Impact-of-Science-on-Society-by-Bertrand-Russell |access-date=10 August 2022 |archive-date=18 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230118175706/https://it.scribd.com/document/558107312/The-Impact-of-Science-on-Society-by-Bertrand-Russell |url-status=dead }}</ref>
{{blockquote|This subject will make great strides when it is taken up by scientists under a scientific dictatorship. Anaxagoras maintained that snow is black, but no one believed him. The social psychologists of the future will have a number of classes of school children on whom they will try different methods of producing an unshakable conviction that snow is black. Various results will soon be arrived at. First, that the influence of home is obstructive. Second, that not much can be done unless indoctrination begins before the age of ten. Third, that verses set to music and repeatedly intoned are very effective. Fourth, that the opinion that snow is white must be held to show a morbid taste for eccentricity. But I anticipate. It is for future scientists to make these maxims precise and discover exactly how much it costs per head to make children believe that snow is black, and how much less it would cost to make them believe it is dark grey. Although this science will be diligently studied, it will be rigidly confined to the governing class. The populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions were generated. When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen. As yet there is only one country which has succeeded in creating this politician's paradise. The social effects of scientific technique have already been many and important, and are likely to be even more noteworthy in the future. Some of these effects depend upon the political and economic character of the country concerned; others are inevitable, whatever this character may be.}}
He pushed his visionary scenarios even further into details, in Chapter III "Scientific Technique in an Oligarchy" of the same book,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Impact of Science on Society |publisher=New York, AMS Press |year=1953 |chapter=Scientific Technique in an Oligarchy |chapter-url=https://it.scribd.com/document/558107312/The-Impact-of-Science-on-Society-by-Bertrand-Russell |access-date=10 August 2022 |archive-date=18 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230118175706/https://it.scribd.com/document/558107312/The-Impact-of-Science-on-Society-by-Bertrand-Russell |url-status=dead }}</ref> stating as an example: {{blockquote| In future such failures are not likely to occur where there is dictatorship. Diet, injections, and injunctions will combine, from a very early age, to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable, and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible. Even if all are miserable, all will believe themselves happy, because the government will tell them that they are so.}}

One pamphlet titled, ''I Appeal unto Caesar': The Case of the Conscientious Objectors'', ghostwritten for Margaret Hobhouse, the mother of imprisoned peace activist [[Stephen Hobhouse]], allegedly helped secure the release from prison of hundreds of [[conscientious objector]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780618758289/page/270 |title=To end all wars: a story of loyalty and rebellion, 1914–1918 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-618-75828-9 |location=Boston |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780618758289/page/270 270–272]}}</ref>

His works can be found in anthologies and collections, including ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'', which [[McMaster University]] began publishing in 1983.
