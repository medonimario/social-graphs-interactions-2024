Nussbaum's work has focused on [[Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] and [[Roman philosophy]], [[political philosophy]], [[existentialism]], [[feminism]], and ethics, including [[animal rights]]. She also holds associate appointments in [[classics]], [[divinity]], and [[political science]], is a member of the Committee on Southern Asian Studies, and a board member of the Human Rights Program. She previously taught at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Brown University|Brown]].<ref>[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/nussbaum/ "Martha Nussbaum"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025085154/https://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/nussbaum |date=October 25, 2019 }}, University of Chicago, accessed June 5, 2012.</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/martha-nussbaums-moral-philosophies|title=The Philosopher of Feelings|last=Aviv|first=Rachel|magazine=The New Yorker|date=July 18, 2016|access-date=June 14, 2019|language=en|issn=0028-792X|archive-date=October 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191013030121/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/martha-nussbaums-moral-philosophies|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Nussbaum was born '''Martha Craven''' on May 6, 1947, in New York City, the daughter of George Craven, a Philadelphia lawyer, and Betty Warren, an interior designer and homemaker. During her teenage years, Nussbaum attended [[The Baldwin School]] in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]]. She described her upbringing as "East Coast [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] elite&nbsp;... very sterile, very preoccupied with money and status".<ref>McLemee, Scott. ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. [http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i06/06a01401.htm "What Makes Martha Nussbaum Run?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710072716/http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i06/06a01401.htm |date=July 10, 2009 }}</ref>  She would later credit her impatience with "mandarin philosophers" and dedication to [[public service]] as the "repudiation of my own aristocratic upbringing. I don't like anything that sets itself up as an in-group or an elite, whether it is the [[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury group]] or [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]".<ref name="robertboynton1">Boynton, Robert S. ''The New York Times Magazine.'' [http://www.robertboynton.com/articleDisplay.php?article_id=55 Who Needs Philosophy?

After studying at [[Wellesley College]] for two years, she dropped out to pursue theatre in New York. She studied theatre and [[classics]] at [[New York University]], getting a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969, and gradually moved to philosophy while at [[Harvard University]], where she received a Master of Arts degree in 1972 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1975, studying under [[G.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;L. Owen]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

==Career==

In the 1970s and early 1980s she taught philosophy and classics at Harvard, where she was denied tenure by the Classics Department in 1982.<ref name="robertboynton1" /> Nussbaum then moved to [[Brown University]], where she taught until 1995 when she joined the [[University of Chicago Law School]] faculty. Her 1986 book ''[[The Fragility of Goodness]]'', on ancient Greek ethics and Greek tragedy, made her a well-known figure throughout the humanities.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=July 18, 2016|title=The Philosopher of Feelings: Martha Nussbaum's far-reaching ideas illuminate the often ignored elements of human life&nbsp;– aging, inequality, and emotion.|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/martha-nussbaums-moral-philosophies|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191013030121/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/martha-nussbaums-moral-philosophies|archive-date=October 13, 2019}}</ref> At Brown, Nussbaum's students included philosopher [[Linda Martín Alcoff]] and actor and playwright [[Tim Blake Nelson]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Singer|first=Mark|date=April 8, 2019|title=Tim Blake Nelson, Classics Nerd, Brings "Socrates" to the Stage|language=en|magazine=The New Yorker|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/15/tim-blake-nelson-classics-nerd-brings-socrates-to-the-stage|url-status=live|access-date=June 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190926044632/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/15/tim-blake-nelson-classics-nerd-brings-socrates-to-the-stage|archive-date=September 26, 2019|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> In 1987, she gained public attention due to her critique of fellow philosopher [[Allan Bloom]]'s ''[[The Closing of the American Mind]].''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Marylin|title=Martha Nussbaum: The Philosopher Queen|url=https://www.momentmag.com/martha-nussbaum-the-philosopher-queen/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530172832/https://www.momentmag.com/martha-nussbaum-the-philosopher-queen/|archive-date=May 30, 2019|access-date=May 30, 2019|website=Moment Magazine|date=July 10, 2018}}</ref>  More recent work (''Frontiers of Justice'') establishes Nussbaum as a theorist of global justice. Nussbaum's work on capabilities has often focused on the unequal freedoms and opportunities of women, and she has developed a distinctive type of [[feminism]], drawing inspiration from the liberal tradition, but emphasizing that liberalism, at its best, entails radical rethinking of gender relations and relations within the family.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha. ''Women and Human Development''. New York:  Cambridge University Press, 2000.</ref>

Nussbaum's other major area of philosophical work is the emotions. She defended a ''neo-[[stoicism|Stoic]]'' account of emotions that holds that they are appraisals that ascribe to things and persons, outside the agent's own control, great significance for the person's own flourishing.  On this basis, she has proposed analyses of grief, compassion, and love,<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. Poetic Justice:  ''Literary Imagination and Public Life.'' Boston:  Beacon Press, 1995.</ref> and, in a later book, of disgust and shame.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Hiding from Humanity:  Shame, Disgust, and the Law''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004.</ref>

Nussbaum has engaged in debates with other intellectuals, in her academic writings as well as in the pages of semi-popular magazines and book reviews and, in one instance, when testifying as an expert witness in court. She testified in the Colorado bench trial for ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', arguing against the claim that the history of philosophy provides the state with a "compelling interest" in favor of a law that sought to overturn local anti-discrimination laws. A portion of this testimony, dealing with the potential meanings of the term ''tolmêma'' in Plato's work, was the subject of controversy, and was called misleading and even [[perjury|perjurious]] by critics.<ref>[http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9609/stand.html The Stand]{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523024049/http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9609/stand.html |date=May 23, 2019 }} by Daniel Mendelsohn, from ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' September 1996.</ref><ref>[http://www.robertboynton.com/articleDisplay.php?article_id=55 Who Needs Philosophy?: A profile of Martha Nussbaum]{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523173436/http://www.robertboynton.com/articleDisplay.php?article_id=55 |date=May 23, 2011 }} by Robert Boynton from ''The New York Times Magazine'', November 21, 1999.</ref>

Nussbaum has criticized [[Noam Chomsky]] as being among the leftist intellectuals who hold the belief that "one should not criticize one's friends, that solidarity is more important than ethical correctness". She suggests that one can "trace this line to an old Marxist contempt for bourgeois ethics, but it is loathsome whatever its provenance".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/violence-on-the-left-nandigram-and-the-communists-of-west-bengal |title=Violence on the Left |author=Martha C.

=== Capabilities approach ===
{{Main|Capability approach}}
Nussbaum is well known for her contributions in developing the [[Capability approach|capabilities approach]] to well-being, alongside [[Amartya Sen]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Schokkaert |first=Erik |date=January 1, 2008 |title=The Capabilities Approach |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1084821 |language=en |location=Rochester, NY |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1084821|ssrn=1084821 |s2cid=15595011 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Measuring Justice: Primary Goods and Capabilities |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |editor-last=Brighouse |editor-first=Harry |language= |chapter= |editor-last2=Robeyns |editor-first2=Ingrid}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last1=Vecchio |first1=Giovanni |last2=Martens |first2=Karel |date=November 2, 2021 |title=Accessibility and the Capabilities Approach: a review of the literature and proposal for conceptual advancements |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01441647.2021.1931551 |journal=Transport Reviews |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=833–854 |doi=10.1080/01441647.2021.1931551 |s2cid=236382308 |issn=0144-1647}}</ref> The key question the capabilities approach asks is "What is each person able to do and to be?"<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha C. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/753976782 |title=Creating capabilities : the human development approach |date=2011 |isbn=978-0-674-06120-0 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |oclc=753976782}}</ref>{{Rp|page=18}} As such, the approach looks at combined capabilities: an individual's developable abilities (''internal abilities''), freedom, and opportunity.<ref name=":1" /> Here, "freedom" refers to the ability of a person to choose one life or another,<ref name=":2" /> and opportunity refers to social, political, and/or economic conditions that allow or disallow individual growth.<ref name=":1" />

Nussbaum asserts that all humans (and non-human animals) have a basic right to dignity. To provide human dignity, she states that governments must provide "at least a threshold level"{{Rp|page=33–34}} of the following capabilities: life; bodily health; bodily integrity; senses, imagination, and thought, emotions; practical reason; affiliation; other species; play; and control over one's environment, including political and material environments.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lozano |first1=J.

==Personal life==
She was married to [[Alan Nussbaum]] from 1969 until they divorced in 1987, a period which also led to her [[conversion to Judaism]] and the birth of her daughter Rachel. Nussbaum's interest in Judaism has continued and deepened: on August 16, 2008, she became a ''[[bat mitzvah]]'' in a service at [[K.A.M. Isaiah Israel Temple|Temple K. A. M. Isaiah Israel]] in Chicago's [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]], chanting from the ''[[Parashah]] Va-etchanan'' and the ''[[Haftarah]] Nahamu'', and delivering a ''D'var [[Torah]]'' about the connection between genuine, non-[[narcissistic]] consolation and the pursuit of [[global justice]].<ref>"The Mourner's Hope: Grief and the Foundations of Justice", ''The Boston Review'', November/December 2008., 18–20.</ref> Nussbaum's daughter Rachel died in 2019 due to a drug-resistant infection following successful transplant surgery.<ref>[https://hd-ca.org/news/in-memoriam-rachel-nussbaum-wichert "In Memoriam – Rachel Nussbaum Wichert,"] Human Development and Capability Association.

''[[The Fragility of Goodness|The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek Tragedy and Philosophy]]''<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek Tragedy and Philosophy.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986.</ref> confronts the [[ethical dilemma]] that individuals strongly committed to [[justice]] are nevertheless vulnerable to external factors that may deeply compromise or even negate their [[Eudaimonia|human flourishing]]. Discussing literary as well as philosophical texts, Nussbaum seeks to determine the extent to which [[reason]] may enable self-sufficiency. She eventually rejects the [[Platonism|Platonic]] notion that human goodness can fully protect against peril, siding with the [[Tragedy|tragic]] playwrights and [[Aristotle]] in treating the acknowledgment of vulnerability as a key to realizing the human good.

Her interpretation of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' in particular drew considerable attention. Under Nussbaum's consciousness of vulnerability, the re-entrance of [[Alcibiades]] at the end of the dialogue undermines [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]]'s account of the ladder of love in its ascent to the non-physical realm of the [[Theory of the forms|forms]]. Alcibiades's presence deflects attention back to physical beauty, sexual passions, and bodily limitations, hence highlighting human fragility.

===''Cultivating Humanity''===
''Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education''<ref name=":3">Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education.'' Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997.</ref> appeals to classical Greek texts as a basis for defense and reform of the [[liberal education]]. Noting the Greek [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] philosopher [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]]' aspiration to transcend "local origins and group memberships" in favor of becoming "a [[Global citizenship#World citizen|citizen of the world]]", Nussbaum traces the development of this idea through the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], [[Cicero]], and eventually the [[classical liberalism]] of [[Adam Smith]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Nussbaum champions [[multiculturalism]] in the context of [[ethical universalism]], defends scholarly inquiry into race, gender, and [[human sexuality]], and further develops the role of literature as narrative imagination into ethical questions.

At the same time, Nussbaum also censured certain scholarly trends. She excoriated [[deconstructionist]] [[Jacques Derrida]] saying "on [[truth]] [he is] simply not worth studying for someone who has been studying [[W. V. O. Quine|Quine]] and [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]]". She cites Zhang Longxi, who labels Derrida's analysis of [[Chinese culture]] "pernicious" and without "evidence of serious study".<ref name=":3" />{{Rp|pages=41 126}} More broadly, Nussbaum criticized [[Michel Foucault]] for his "historical incompleteness [and] lack of conceptual clarity", but nevertheless singled him out for providing "the only truly important work to have entered philosophy under the banner of '[[Postmodern philosophy|postmodernism]].'<ref name=":3" />{{Rp|page=40}}  Nussbaum is even more critical of figures like [[Allan Bloom]], [[Roger Kimball]], and [[George Will]] for what she considers their "shaky" knowledge of non-Western cultures and inaccurate caricatures of today's humanities departments.

''[[The New York Times]]'' praised ''Cultivating Humanity'' as "a passionate, closely argued defense of multiculturalism" and hailed it as "a formidable, perhaps definitive defense of diversity on American campuses".<ref>Shapiro, James. ''Beyond the Culture Wars''. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4D61E3EF937A35752C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2/ ''The New York Times'']</ref> Nussbaum received the 2002 University of Louisville [[Grawemeyer Award]] in Education for ''Cultivating Humanity''.<ref>{{cite web |title=2002 – Martha Nussbaum |url=http://grawemeyer.org/2002-martha-nussbaum/ |website=Grawemeyer Awards |date=July 21, 2002 |access-date=March 1, 2022}}</ref>

===''Sex and Social Justice''===
''Sex and Social Justice'' argues that sex and sexuality are morally irrelevant distinctions that have been artificially enforced as sources of [[social hierarchy]]; thus, [[feminism]] and [[social justice]] have common concerns. Rejecting anti-universalist objections, Nussbaum proposes functional freedoms, or central human capabilities, as a rubric of social justice.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex & Social Justice.'' New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1999.  pp. 29–47.</ref>{{Unclear inline|date=June 2021}}

Nussbaum discusses at length the feminist critiques of liberalism itself, including the charge advanced by [[Alison Jaggar]] that liberalism demands [[ethical egoism]]. Nussbaum notes that liberalism emphasizes respect for ''others'' as individuals, and further argues that Jaggar has elided the distinction between [[individualism]] and self-sufficiency. Nussbaum accepts [[Catharine MacKinnon]]'s critique of abstract liberalism, assimilating the salience of history and context of group hierarchy and subordination, but concludes that this appeal is rooted in liberalism rather than a critique of it.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex & Social Justice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1999.  pp. 55–80.</ref>

Nussbaum condemns the practice of [[female genital mutilation]], citing deprivation of [[normative]] human functioning in its risks to health, impact on sexual functioning, violations of dignity, and conditions of non-[[autonomy]]. Emphasizing that female genital mutilation is carried out by brute force, its irreversibility, its non-consensual nature, and its links to customs of [[Patriarchy|male domination]], Nussbaum urges feminists to confront female genital mutilation as an issue of injustice.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex & Social Justice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1999.  pp. 118–130.</ref>

Nussbaum also refines the concept of "[[objectification]]", as originally advanced by [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]]. Nussbaum defines the idea of treating as an object with seven qualities: [[instrumental rationality|instrumentality]], denial of autonomy, inertness, [[fungibility]], violability, ownership, and denial of [[subjectivity]]. Her characterization of pornography as a tool of objectification puts Nussbaum at odds with [[sex-positive feminism]]. At the same time, Nussbaum argues in support of the legalization of prostitution, a position she reiterated in a 2008 essay following the [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal|Spitzer scandal]], writing: "The idea that we ought to penalize women with few choices by removing one of the ones they do have is grotesque."<ref>Martha Nussbaum, "[http://www.ajc.com/search/content/opinion/2008/03/13/spitzered_0314.html Trading on America's puritanical streak] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317232352/http://www.ajc.com/search/content/opinion/2008/03/13/spitzered_0314.html |date=March 17, 2008 }}", ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', March 14, 2008</ref>

''Sex and Social Justice'' was highly praised by critics in the press. ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' declared: "She shows brilliantly how sex is used to deny some people—i.e., women and gay men—social justice."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/books/it/1999/04/19/nussbaum/|title=Rescuing the Feminist Book|author=Maria Russo|work=salon.com|date=April 19, 1999|access-date=May 27, 2008|archive-date=February 20, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030220064140/http://www.salon.com/books/it/1999/04/19/nussbaum/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the work as "elegantly written and carefully argued".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/14/reviews/990314.14ryanlt.html?scp=5&sq=martha+nussbaum&st=cse|title=Cultural Perversions|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=October 31, 2017|archive-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112342/http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/14/reviews/990314.14ryanlt.html?scp=5&sq=martha+nussbaum&st=cse|url-status=live}}</ref> Kathryn Trevenen praised Nussbaum's effort to shift feminist concerns toward interconnected transnational efforts, and for explicating a set of universal guidelines to structure an agenda of social justice.<ref>Trevenen, Kathryn.

===''Hiding from Humanity''===
''Hiding from Humanity''<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Hiding from Humanity: Disgust, Shame, and the Law.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004.</ref> extends Nussbaum's work in [[moral psychology]] to probe the arguments for including two emotions—[[shame]] and [[disgust]]—as legitimate bases for legal judgments. Nussbaum argues that individuals tend to repudiate their bodily imperfection or [[animal]]ity through the projection of fears about contamination. This cognitive response is in itself irrational, because we cannot transcend the animality of our bodies. Noting how [[psychological projection|projective]] disgust has wrongly justified group subordination (mainly of women, Jews, and homosexuals), Nussbaum ultimately discards disgust as a reliable basis of judgment.
[[File:Nussbaum Martha2.jpg|thumb|upright|Nussbaum in 2004]]
In an interview with ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, Nussbaum elaborated:
{{blockquote|Disgust and shame are inherently [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]]; they set up ranks and orders of human beings. They are also inherently connected with restrictions on [[liberty]] in areas of non-harmful conduct. For both of these reasons, I believe, anyone who cherishes the key democratic values of [[egalitarianism|equality]] and liberty should be deeply suspicious of the appeal to those emotions in the context of law and [[public policy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/33316.html|title=Discussing Disgust|work=Reason.com|date=2004-07-15|access-date=February 22, 2008|archive-date=February 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218040129/https://www.reason.com/news/show/33316.html|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

Nussbaum's work was received with wide praise. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called her argument "characteristically lucid" and hailed her as "America's most prominent philosopher of public life".<ref>Wilson, John.

Lindquist of [[Vanderbilt University]] lauded Nussbaum's analysis as a "remarkably wide ranging and nuanced treatise on the interplay between emotions and law".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/nussbaum904.htm|title=''Stefanie A.

A prominent exception was [[Roger Kimball]]'s review published in ''[[The New Criterion]]'',<ref>Kimball, Roger. ''The New Criterion''.[http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/23/sept04/shame.htm ''Does Shame have a Future?''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203174720/http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/23/sept04/shame.htm |date=February 3, 2008 }}</ref> in which he accused Nussbaum of "fabricating" the renewed prevalence of shame and disgust in public discussions and says she intends to "undermine the inherited moral wisdom of millennia". He rebukes her for "contempt for the opinions of ordinary people" and ultimately accuses Nussbaum herself of "hiding from humanity".

Nussbaum has recently drawn on and extended her work on disgust to produce a new analysis of the legal issues regarding sexual orientation and same-sex conduct.  Her book ''From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and the Constitution'' was published by Oxford University Press in 2009, as part of their "Inalienable Rights" series, edited by Geoffrey Stone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Law/ConstitutionalLaw/?view=usa&ci=9780195305319|title=From Disgust to Humanity|work=oup.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604142304/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Law/ConstitutionalLaw/?view=usa&ci=9780195305319|archive-date=June 4, 2011}}</ref>

===''From Disgust to Humanity''===
In her 2010 book ''From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law'', Nussbaum analyzes the role that disgust plays in law and public debate in the United States.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha. Oxford University Press. "From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law" (2010)</ref> The book primarily analyzes constitutional legal issues facing gay and lesbian Americans but also analyzes issues such as anti-miscegenation statutes, segregation, antisemitism and the caste system in India as part of its broader thesis regarding the "politics of disgust".

Nussbaum posits that the fundamental motivation of those advocating legal restrictions against gay and lesbian Americans is a "politics of disgust". These legal restrictions include blocking [[sexual orientation]] being protected under [[anti-discrimination law]]s (see ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''), sodomy laws against consenting adults (see ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''), constitutional bans against same-sex marriage (see [[California Proposition 8 (2008)]]). Nussbaum also argues that legal bans on conducts, such as nude dancing in private clubs, nudity on private beaches, the possession and consumption of alcohol in seclusion, gambling in seclusion or in a private club, which remain on the books, partake of the politics of disgust and should be overturned.<ref>Nussbaum, ''From Disgust to Humanity'', 154–155.</ref>

She identifies the "politics of disgust" closely with [[Lord Devlin]] and his famous opposition to the [[Wolfenden report]], which recommended decriminalizing private consensual homosexual acts, on the basis that those things would "disgust the average man". To Devlin, the mere fact some people or act may produce popular emotional reactions of disgust provides an appropriate guide for legislating. She also identifies the '[[wisdom of repugnance]]' as advocated by [[Leon Kass]] as another "politics of disgust" school of thought as it claims that disgust "in crucial cases ... repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it".

Nussbaum goes on to explicitly oppose the concept of a disgust-based morality as an appropriate guide for legislating. Nussbaum notes that popular disgust has been used throughout history as a justification for persecution. Drawing upon her earlier work on the relationship between disgust and shame, Nussbaum notes that at various times, racism, [[antisemitism]], and [[sexism]], have all been driven by popular revulsion.<ref name="Nussbaum 2004">{{Cite web |author=Nussbaum, Martha C. |url=http://chronicle.com/free/v50/i48/48b00601.htm |title=Danger to Human Dignity: The Revival of Disgust and Shame in the Law |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=August 6, 2004 |access-date=November 24, 2007 |location=Washington, DC |archive-date=July 10, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710070415/http://chronicle.com/free/v50/i48/48b00601.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In place of this "politics of disgust", Nussbaum argues for the [[harm principle]] from [[John Stuart Mill]] as the proper basis for limiting individual liberties. Nussbaum argues the harm principle, which supports the legal ideas of [[consent]], the [[age of majority]], and [[privacy]], protects citizens while the "politics of disgust" is merely an unreliable emotional reaction with no inherent wisdom. Furthermore, Nussbaum argues this "politics of disgust" has denied and continues to deny citizens humanity and [[equality before the law]] on no rational grounds and causes palpable social harms to the groups affected.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

=== ''Creating Capabilities'' ===
{{main|Creating Capabilities}}
The book ''Creating Capabilities'', first published in 2011, outlines a unique theory regarding the [[Capability approach]] or the [[Human development (economics)|Human development]] approach. Nussbaum draws on theories of other notable advocates of the Capability approach like [[Amartya Sen]], but has a distinct approach. She proposes to choose a list of capabilities based on some aspects of [[John Rawls|John Rawls']] concept of "central human capabilities."<ref>{{Citation |last1=Robeyns |first1=Ingrid |title=The Capability Approach |date=2021 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2021/entries/capability-approach/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Winter 2021 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=October 14, 2022 |last2=Byskov |first2=Morten Fibieger}}</ref>  

Nussbaum's book combines ideas from the [[Capability approach]], [[development economics]], and [[distributive justice]] to substantiate a qualitative theory on capabilities. She criticizes existing economic indicators like GDP as failing to fully account for quality of life and assurance of basic needs, instead rewarding countries with large growth distributed highly unequally across the population.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gg7Q2V8fi8gC |title=Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach |date=2011 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-05054-9 |language=en}}</ref> The book also aims to serve as an introduction to the Capability approach more generally; it is accessible to students and newcomers to the material because of the current lack of general knowledge about this approach. Finally, Nussbaum compares her approach with other popular approaches to human development and economic welfare, including [[Utilitarianism]], [[Rawlsian Justice]], and [[Welfarism]] in order to argue why the Capability approach should be prioritized by development economics policymakers.<ref name=":02" />
