'''Alfred Firmin Loisy''' ({{IPA|fr|lwazi|lang}}) (28 February 1857{{snd}}1 June 1940) was a French [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] priest, professor and [[theology|theologian]] generally credited as a founder of [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|modernism]] in the Roman Catholic Church.<ref name=LoisyB>{{BBKL|l/loisy|band=5|autor= Wolfgang Weiß|artikel=Loisy, Alfred Firmin|spalten=190-196}}</ref> He was a critic of traditional views of the interpretation of the [[Bible]], and argued that [[biblical criticism]] could be helpful for a theological interpretation of the Bible.

He famously wrote "Jesus announced the [[Kingdom of God (Christianity)|kingdom]], and it is the Church that came".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Morrow |first=Jeffrey L |date=2019 |title=Thy Kingdom Come: The Church and the Kingdom of God in Loisy's L'Évangile et l'Église |journal=The Downside Review |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages=3–13 |doi=10.1177/0012580619832255 |s2cid=197905004 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Butticaz |first=Simon |date=2021 |title=Comment l'Église est-elle née ? |journal=Labor et Fides, Coll. "Le Monde de la Bible" |issue=75}}</ref>

His theological positions brought him into conflict with the church's authorities, including [[Pope Leo XIII]] and [[Pope Pius X]]. In 1893, he was dismissed as a professor from the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]].  His books were condemned by the [[Roman Curia]],<ref>Pope, Hugh. [https://archive.org/stream/americancatholic29philuoft#page/550/mode/2up "The Condemnation of Four Works by Abbé Loisy,"] ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review,'' Vol. XXIX, 1904.</ref> and in 1908 he was [[Excommunication in the Catholic Church|excommunicated]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Biblical Criticism (Higher) |url=https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04491c.htm |access-date=2023-02-04 |website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref>

== Education ==
Born on 28 February 1857 at [[Ambrières]],<ref name=LoisyB/> Loisy was put into the ecclesiastical school of [[Saint-Dizier]] at four years old.<ref name=Boynton /> He decided for the priesthood{{sfn|von Hügel|1911|p=926}} and was educated from 1874 to 1879 at the Grand séminaire de Châlons-en-Champagne; he entered the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]] in 1878/1879.<ref name=LoisyB/> Prior to his ordination to the subdiaconate, he had experienced doubts regarding the soundness of the Catholic faith.<ref name=Boynton>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1507392 Boynton, Richard Wilson. "The Catholic Career of Alfred Loisy", ''The Harvard Theological Review'', Vol. 11, No. 1 (1918), pp. 36-73, Cambridge University Press]</ref> After an illness he returned to the Institut and was ordained a priest on 29 June 1879. Initially assigned parish work, in 1881 he requested to be reassigned to the Institut to complete his [[baccalauréat]] in theology. That autumn he became instructor in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. He took additional courses in Hebrew with [[Ernest Renan]] at the [[Collège de France]]. He was also influenced, as to biblical languages and textual criticism, by the [[Paulin Martin|Abbé Paulin Martin]], and as to a consciousness of the biblical problems and a sense of form by the historical intuition and irony of Abbé [[Louis Duchesne]]. He took his theological degree in March 1890, by the oral defense of forty Latin scholastic theses and by a French dissertation, ''Histoire du canon de l'ancien testament'', published as his first book in that year.{{sfn|von Hügel|1911|p=926}}

== Early Biblical criticism ==
Some of his work appeared in the bi-monthly ''L'Enseignement biblique'', a periodical written throughout and published by himself.{{sfn|von Hügel|1911|p=926}} In November 1893, Loisy published the last lecture of his course, in which he summed up his position on [[Biblical criticism]] in five propositions: the [[Pentateuch]] was not the work of [[Moses]], the first five chapters of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] were not literal history, the [[New Testament]] and the [[Old Testament]] did not possess equal historical value, there was a development in scriptural doctrine, and Biblical writings were subject to the same limitations as those by other authors of the ancient world.<ref name=Boynton /> This resulted in Loisy's dismissal from his teaching position. A few days later [[Pope Leo XIII]] published the encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]]'', which indirectly condemned  Abbé Loisy's and [[Maurice Le Sage d'Hauteroche d'Hulst|Mgr d'Hulst]]'s position, and rendered the continued publication of consistently critical work so difficult that Loisy himself suppressed his ''Enseignement'' at the end of 1893.{{sfn|von Hügel|1911|p=926}}

==Historical apologetics for the development of the Catholic Church==
His 1908 ''Les Évangiles Synoptiques'' would cause his [[Excommunication in the Catholic Church|excommunication]]. In his works he argued against the views of [[Adolf von Harnack]], the German Lutheran theologian, who was trying to show that it was necessary and inevitable for the Catholic Church to form as it did. In doing so, Loisy implicitly accepted the eschatology of [[Johannes Weiss]] (this eschatology is named ''[[consistent eschatology]]''): Jesus thought the coming of the [[Kingdom of God (Christianity)|Kingdom]] was imminent, so there was no point in founding a Church. Only after his death and resurrection was his original proclamation of the Kingdom transformed into this sense by his disciples, and legitimately so, as Loisy pointed out against Harnack's conception of Christianity: {{Blockquote|It is certain, for instance, that Jesus did not systematize beforehand the constitution of the Church as that of a government established on earth and destined to endure for a long series of centuries. But a conception far more foreign still to His thoughts and to His authentic teaching is that of an invisible society formed for ever of those who have in their hearts faith in the goodness of God [Harnack]. We have seen that the gospel of Jesus already contained a rudiment of social organization, and that the Kingdom also was announced as a society. Jesus foretold the Kingdom, and it was the Church that came; she came, enlarging the form of the [[gospel]], which it was impossible to preserve as it was, as soon as the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] closed the [[ministry of Jesus]]. There is no institution on the earth or in history whose status and value may not be questioned if the principle is established that nothing may exist except in its original form. Such a principle is contrary to the law of life, which is movement and a continual effort of adaptation to conditions always new and perpetually changing. Christianity has not escaped this law, and cannot be reproached for submission to it. It could not do otherwise than it has done.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Gospel and the Church|last=Loisy|first=Alfred|publisher=Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons, LTD.|year=1908|location=London|pages=166|translator-last=Home|translator-first=Christopher|url=https://archive.org/details/gospelchurch00loisuoft/page/166/mode/2up}}</ref>}} The second part of the quotation echoes [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman's]] theory on the [[Development of doctrine|development of Christian doctrine]] which Loisy had studied in his time at Neuilly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Alfred Loisy. La crise de la foi dans le temps présent. Essais d'histoire et de philosophie religieuses|publisher=Brepols|doi=10.1484/M.BEHE-EB.4.00222|year=2010|editor-last=Laplanche|editor-first=François|location=Turnhout|isbn=9782503531823}}</ref> Although ''L'Évangile et L'Église'' in particular was condemned by [[François-Marie-Benjamin Richard|Cardinal Richard]], Pope Leo consistently refused to interfere directly.{{sfn|von Hügel|1911|p=927}} It was his successor, [[Pope Pius X]] who would later condemn these works.

Another controversial thesis of Loisy, developed in ''La Religion d'Israël'', is the distinction between a [[Yahwism|pre-Moses period]], when the [[Hebrews]] worshipped the god [[El (deity)|El]], also known by the plural of this name, [[Elohim]], and a later stage, when [[Yahweh]] gradually became the  only deity of the Jews.<ref>Loisy, Alfred and Galton, Arthur (2009). ''The Religion of Israel''. BiblioBazaar, pp. 6-7. {{ISBN|1-115-38922-X}}</ref>

==Pope Pius X==
Cardinal Sarto became [[Pope Pius X]] on 4 August 1903. On 1 October, Loisy published three new books, ''Autour d'un petit livre'', ''Le Quatrième Évangile'' and ''Le Discours sur la Montagne'' (a fragment of a proposed enlarged commentary on the [[Synoptic Gospels]]). ''Autour'' consists of seven letters on different topics addressed to church leaders and friends. Urged by the Parisian Archbishop [[François-Marie-Benjamin Richard|Cardinal Richard]], Pius X transferred the scrutiny of Loisy's books, started under Leo XIII in 1901 under the [[Congregation of the Index]], to the [[Holy Office]]. By 23 December 1903, the Congregation censured Loisy's main exegetical works: ''Religion d'Israël'', ''L'Évangile et l'Église'', ''Études évangéliques'', ''Autour d'un petit livre'' and ''Le Quatrième Évangile''.{{sfn|Arnold|Losito|2009}}

=== Condemnation ===
On 12 January 1904 Loisy wrote to the Vatican [[Cardinal Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Rafael Merry del Val|Cardinal Merry del Val]], that he received the condemnation with respect, and condemned whatever might be reprehensible in his books, whilst reserving the rights of his conscience and his opinions as an historian. The [[Holy See]] was not satisfied, and Loisy sent three further declarations; the last, dispatched on 17 March, was addressed to the pope himself, and remained unanswered. At the end of March, Loisy gave up his lectureship, as he declared, on his own initiative. In April 1907 he returned to his native Lorraine, to his relatives in [[Ceffonds]] near [[Montier-en-Der]].{{sfn|von Hügel|1911|p=927}}

In 1904 the Holy Office began to compile a syllabus of errors in the works of Loisy.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Claus |first=Arnold |url= |title=Le pontificat romain dans l'époque contemporaine {{!}} The Papacy in the Contemporary Age |publisher=Edizioni Ca' Foscari |year=2018 |editor-last=Vian |editor-first=Giovanni |series=Studi di storia |volume=5 |language=en-US |chapter=Pius X, Merry del Val and the cases of Alfred Loisy and George Tyrrell |doi=10.30687/978-88-6969-239-0/002 |isbn=978-88-6969-256-7 |s2cid=188218619 |access-date=2023-02-04 |chapter-url=https://edizionicafoscari.unive.it/libri/978-88-6969-256-7/pius-x-merry-del-val-and-the-cases-of-alfred-loisy/}}</ref> Due to ongoing internal resistance, especially from the [[Master of the Sacred Palace]], the papal theologian Alberto Lepidi, this syllabus was published only in July 1907 as the decree ''[[Lamentabili sane exitu]]''<ref>[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius10/p10lamen.htm Lamentabili sane exitu]</ref> (or "A Lamentable Departure Indeed"); it condemned sixty-five propositions from the field of biblical interpretation and the history of [[dogma]].{{sfn|Arnold|Losito|2011}} They concerned the nature of the church, [[revelation]], [[biblical exegesis]], the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]], and the [[divinity of Christ]]. This was followed a year later by the encyclical ''[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]'' ("Feeding the Lord's Flock"), which characterized [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|modernism]] as the "synthesis of [[List of heresies in the Catholic Church|all heresies]]". The documents made Loisy realise that there was no hope for reconciliation of his views with official Catholic doctrine. He made a comparative study of the papal documents to show the condemned propositions in his own writings. He also asserted as true various of his earlier New Testament interpretations, which previously he had formulated in conditional form.{{sfn|Ratté|1968|p=46}} In his [[diary]] he wrote:

{{Blockquote|Christ has even less importance in my religion than he does in that of the [[liberal Protestant]]s: for I attach little importance to the revelation of [[God in Christianity|God the Father]] for which they honor Jesus. If I am anything in religion, it is more [[pantheist]]-[[positivist]]-[[humanitarian]] than Christian.|Mémoires II, p. 397<ref>Cf. {{cite book |title = Alfred Loisy, Sa Vie, Son Oeuvre   | last = Houtin |first = A. |author2=Sartiaux F. |pages = 121–129}}</ref>}}

His Catholic critics commented that his religious system envisioned a great society which he believed to be the historically developed Church.{{sfn|Ratté|1968|p=120}} For many, the attitude of Loisy and his followers was incomprehensible. While Modernists asked, "How can the Church survive?", for Pius X the question was, "How can these men be priests?"{{sfn|Ratté|1968|p=47}}

The censure did not deter Loisy from publishing three further books. ''Les Évangiles synoptiques'', two large volumes of 1,009 and 798 pages, appeared in January 1908. This contains a detailed commentary on the Synoptic Gospels, combining the ecclesiastical tradition, modern criticism, the Gospel narrative, and the tradition of the text and the previous commentaries. The commentary gives also a careful translation of the texts. Loisy recognizes two eye-witness documents, as utilized by all three Gospels. He traces a strong [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] influence, especially in the [[Gospel of Mark]]. Yet the great bulk of the sayings is acknowledged as substantially authentic; if the historicity of certain words and acts is here denied with unusual assurance, that of other sayings and deeds is established with stronger proofs; and the redemptive conception of the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] and the sacramental interpretation of the [[Last Supper]] are found to spring up promptly and legitimately from Christ's work and words.{{sfn|von Hügel|1911|pp=927-928}}

The third book, ''Simples Réflexions sur le décret Lamentabili et sur l'encyclique Pascendi'' (277 pages), was published from Ceffonds a few days after the commentary. Each proposition of the decree is carefully tracked to its probable source, and is often found to modify the latter's meaning. The study of the encyclical concludes: "Time is the great teacher […] we would do wrong to despair either of our civilization or of the Church."{{sfn|von Hügel|1911|pp=927-928}}

The ecclesiastical authorities were not slow to act. On 14 February 1908 [[Léon-Adolphe Amette]], archbishop of Paris, prohibited his diocesans to read or defend the two books, which "attack and deny several fundamental dogmas of Christianity," under pain of excommunication.{{sfn|von Hügel|1911|p=928}}

=== Excommunication ===
Loisy was excommunicated ''[[vitandus]]'' on 7 March 1908.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lannoy |first=Annelies |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIlnEAAAQBAJ&dq=Alfred+Loisy+excommunication+vitandus&pg=PA75 |title=Alfred Loisy and the Making of History of Religions: A Study of the Development of Comparative Religion in the Early 20th Century |date=2020-08-10 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG |isbn=978-3-11-058435-6 |series=Religionsgeschichtliche Versuche und Vorarbeiten |volume=74 |pages=75 |language=en |chapter=An Intricate Piece of Institutional History: The Election for the Chair of History of Religions at the ''Collège de France'' (1908-1909) |doi=10.1515/9783110584356|s2cid=214466342 }}</ref>

After his excommunication Loisy became a secular intellectual.{{sfn|Ratté|1968|p=123}} He was appointed Chair of History of Religions in the [[Collège de France]] in 1909 and served there until retiring in 1931. In that post, he continued to develop his philosophy, describing the Christian religion as a humanist system of ethics rather than divine. He also developed his studies of early religions and their influence on Christianity. He never recanted, and died in 1940 in Ceffonds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Firmin-Loisy |title=Alfred Firmin Loisy  |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=4 March 2017}}</ref>
