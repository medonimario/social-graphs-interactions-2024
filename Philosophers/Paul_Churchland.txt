'''Paul Montgomery Churchland''' (born October 21, 1942) is a Canadian philosopher known for his studies in [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. After earning a Ph.D. from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] under [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (1969), Churchland rose to the rank of full professor at the [[University of Manitoba]] before accepting the Valtz Family Endowed Chair in Philosophy at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD) and joint appointments in that institution's [[Institute for Neural Computation]] and on its Cognitive Science Faculty.

As of February 2017, Churchland is recognised as Professor Emeritus at the [[University of California, San Diego|UCSD]], and is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Moscow Center for Consciousness Studies of [[Moscow State University]]. Churchland is the husband of philosopher [[Patricia Churchland]], with whom he collaborates closely.

==Early life and education==

As a boy, he was obsessed with science fiction; he was particularly struck by the ideas in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Orphans of the Sky]]''.

==Philosophical work==

Churchland's work is in the school of [[analytic philosophy]] in [[western philosophy]], with interests in [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of science]], and specific principal interests in the [[philosophy of mind]] and in [[neurophilosophy]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. His work has been described as being influenced by the work of [[W. V. O. Quine]], [[Thomas Kuhn]], Russell Hanson, [[Wilfrid Sellars]], and [[Paul Feyerabend]].<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/30119/excerpt/9780521830119_excerpt.pdf |title=Paul Churchland |last=Keeley |first=Brian L. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-521-53715-0 |editor-last=Keeley |editor-first=Brian L. |location=Cambridge, UK |page=3 |chapter=Introduction: Becoming Paul M. Churchland (1942–)}}</ref>

Along with his wife, Churchland is a major proponent of [[eliminative materialism]],<ref>{{cite book | author = Ramsey, William | year = 2013 | orig-date = 2003 | chapter = Eliminative Materialism | chapter-format = revision of 16 April 2013, based on 8 May 2003 original | title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | editor = Zalta, Edward N.|chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/materialism-eliminative/|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=11 February 2017 | quote=In more recent history, eliminative materialism has received attention from a broader range of writers, including many concerned not only with the metaphysics of the mind, but also the process of theory change, the status of semantic properties, the nature of psychological explanation and recent developments in cognitive science. Much of this attention has been fostered by the husband-wife team of Paul and Patricia Churchland, whose writings have forced many philosophers and cognitive scientists to take eliminativism more seriously.}}</ref> the belief that

{{blockquote|everyday, common-sense, [[folk psychology|'folk' psychology]], which seeks to explain human behavior in terms of the beliefs and desires of agents, is actually a deeply flawed theory that must be eliminated in favor of a mature cognitive neuroscience.<ref name = ZawidzkiDPMbio04/>}} 

where by folk psychology is meant everyday mental concepts such as beliefs, feelings, and desires, which are viewed as theoretical constructs without coherent definition, and thus destined to be obviated by a scientific understanding of human nature. From the perspective of [[Zawidzki]], Churchland's concept of eliminativism is suggested as early as his book ''Scientific Realism and the Plasticity of Mind'' (1979), with its most explicit formulation appearing in a ''Journal of Philosophy'' essay, "Eliminative Materialism and the Propositional Attitudes" (1981).<ref name = ZawidzkiDPMbio04/>

Churchland believes that beliefs are not ontologically real; that is, that a future, fully matured [[neuroscience]] is likely to have no need for "beliefs" (see [[propositional attitudes]]), in the same manner that modern science discarded such notions as legends or witchcraft. According to Churchland, such concepts will not merely be ''reduced'' to more finely grained explanation and retained as useful proximate levels of description, but will be strictly ''eliminated'' as wholly lacking in correspondence to precise objective phenomena, such as activation patterns across [[neural network (biology)|neural networks]]. He points out that the history of science has seen many posits that were considered as real entities: such as [[phlogiston]]; caloric; the [[luminiferous ether]]; and [[Vitalism|vital forces]] that were thus eliminated.{{cn|date=June 2023}}

Moreover, in ''The Engine of Reason, The Seat of the Soul'' Churchland suggests that consciousness might be explained in terms of a [[recurrent neural network]] with its hub in the [[intralaminar nucleus]] of the [[thalamus]], and feedback connections to all parts of the cortex. He acknowledges that this proposal will likely be found in error with regard to the neurological details, but states his belief that it is on the right track in its use of recurrent neural networks to account for consciousness. This has been described as a [[reductionism|reductionist]] rather than eliminativist account of consciousness.{{cn|date=June 2023}}

==Personal life==
Churchland is the husband of philosopher [[Patricia Churchland]], and it has been noted that, "Their work is so similar that they are sometimes discussed, in journals and books, as one person."<ref>{{cite journal|author=MacFarquhar, Larissa|date=February 12, 2007 | title=Two Heads: A marriage devoted to the mind-body problem|journal=[[The New Yorker]] |pages=58–69 |pmid=17323512 | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/02/12/two-heads | access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

The Churchlands are the parents of two children, Mark Churchland and [[Anne Churchland]], both of whom are neuroscientists.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/02/12/two-heads|title=Why Should Philosophers Care About Neuroscience?|last=MacFarquhar|first=Larissa|magazine=The New Yorker|date=2014-07-21|access-date=2019-06-06|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>
