== Circumstances ==
Avicenna created an extensive corpus of works during what is commonly known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]], in which the translations of [[Byzantine]], [[Greco-Roman]], [[Middle Persian literature|Persian]], and [[India]]n texts were studied extensively. Greco-Roman ([[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonic]], [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]], and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]) texts translated by the [[al-Kindi|Kindi school]] were commented, redacted and developed substantially by Islamic intellectuals, who also built upon Persian and [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematical]] systems, [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]] and [[Ancient Iranian medicine|medicine]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Major periods of Muslim education and learning |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-47496/education |access-date=16 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212112030/https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-47496/education |archive-date=12 December 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Samanid Empire]] in the eastern part of Persia, [[Greater Khorasan]], and [[Central Asia]], as well as the [[Buyid dynasty]] in the western part of Persia and [[Iraq]], provided a thriving atmosphere for scholarly and cultural development. Under the Samanids, [[Bukhara]] rivaled [[Baghdad]] for cultural capital of the [[Muslim world]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Iran |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=http://p2.www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=106324&fullArticle=true&tocId=9106324 |access-date=16 December 2007 |last=Afary |first=Janet |author-link=Janet Afary |archive-date=13 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813184232/http://p2.www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=106324&fullArticle=true&tocId=9106324 |url-status=live }}</ref> There, Avicenna had access to the great libraries of [[Balkh]], [[Khwarazm]], [[Gorgan]], [[Ray, Iran|Rey]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Hamadan]].

Various texts (such as the 'Ahd with Bahmanyar) show that Avicenna debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time. [[Nizami Aruzi]] described how before ibn Sina left Khwarazm, he had met [[al-Biruni]] (a famous scientist and astronomer), [[Abu Nasr Mansur]] (a renowned mathematician), [[Abu Sahl 'Isa ibn Yahya al-Masihi]] (a respected philosopher) and [[ibn al-Khammar]] (a great physician). The study of the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]] also thrived, and Islamic philosophy, [[fiqh]] "jurisprudence", and [[kalam]] "speculative theology" were all further developed by ibn Sina and his opponents at this time.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Avicenna was born in {{circa|980}} in the village of Afshana in [[Transoxiana]] to a Persian family.<ref>According to {{harvnb|El-Bizri|2006|p=369}}, Avicenna was "of Persian descent". According to {{harvnb|Khalidi|2005|p=xviii}}, Avicenna was "born of Persian parentage". According to {{harvnb|Copleston|1993|p=190}}, Avicenna was "Persian by birth". {{harvnb|Gutas|2014|pp=xi,310}}, mentions Avicenna as an example for "Persian-born authors" and speaks of "presumed Persian origins" for Avicenna. {{harvnb|Glick|Livesey|Wallis|2005|p=256}}, states "An ethnic Persian, he [Avicenna] was born in Kharmaithen, near Bukhara".</ref> The village was near the Samanid capital of [[Bukhara]], which was his mother's hometown.{{sfn|Goichon|1986|p=941}} His father Abd Allah was a native of the city of [[Balkh]] in [[Bactria]].{{sfn|Gutas|2014|p=11}} An official of the Samanid bureaucracy, he had served as the governor of a village of the royal estate of Harmaytan near Bukhara during the reign of [[Nuh II]] ({{reign|976|997}}).{{sfn|Gutas|2014|p=11}} Avicenna also had a younger brother. A few years later, the family settled in Bukhara, a center of learning, which attracted many scholars. It was there that Avicenna was educated, which early on was seemingly administered by his father.{{sfn|Gutas|1987|pp=67–70}}{{sfn|Gutas|2014|p=12}}{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=8}} 

Although both Avicenna's father and brother had converted to [[Isma'ilism]], he himself did not follow the faith.{{sfn|Daftary|2017|p=191}}{{sfn|Daftary|2007|pp=202–203}} He was instead a [[Hanafi school|Hanafi Sunni]], the same school followed by the Samanids.{{sfn|Gutas|1988|pp=330–331}}

Avicenna was first schooled in the [[Quran]] and literature, and by the age of 10, he had [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized the entire Quran]].{{sfn|Gutas|2014|p=12}} He was later sent by his father to an Indian greengrocer, who taught him [[arithmetic]].{{sfn|Gutas|2014|p=13}} Afterwards, he was schooled in fiqh by the Hanafi [[faqīh|jurist]] Ismail al-Zahid. Sometime later, his father invited the physician and philosopher [[al-Natili]] to their house to educate ibn Sina.{{sfn|Gutas|2014|p=12}}{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=8}} Together, they studied the ''[[Isagoge]]'' of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (died 305) and possibly the [[Categories (Aristotle)|''Categories'' of Aristotle]] (died 322 BCE) as well. After Avicenna had read the ''[[Almagest]]'' of [[Ptolemy]] (died 170) and [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], al-Natili told him to continue his research independently.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=8}} By the time Avicenna was eighteen, he was well-educated in [[science in classical antiquity|Greek sciences]]. Although ibn Sina only mentions al-Natili as his teacher in his [[autobiography]], he most likely had other teachers as well, such as the physicians [[Qumri]] and Abu Sahl 'Isa ibn Yahya al-Masihi.{{sfn|Gutas|1987|pp=67–70}}{{sfn|Gutas|2014|p=13}}

=== Career ===
==== In Bukhara and Gurganj ====
[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Geophysical map of southern Central Asia (Khurasan and Transoxiana) with the major settlements and regions|Map of [[Khurasan]] and [[Transoxiana]]]]
At the age of seventeen, Avicenna was made a physician of Nuh II. By the time Avicenna was at least 21 years old, his father died. He was subsequently given an administrative post, possibly succeeding his father as the governor of Harmaytan. Avicenna later moved to [[Gurganj]], the capital of Khwarazm, which he reports that he did due to "necessity". The date he went to the place is uncertain, as he reports that he served the [[Khwarazmshah]], the ruler of Khwarazm, the [[Ma'munids|Ma'munid]] ruler [[Abu al-Hasan Ali]]. The latter ruled from 997 to 1009, which indicates that Avicenna moved sometime during that period.

He may have moved in 999, the year in which the Samanid Empire fell after the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] captured Bukhara and imprisoned the Samanid emir [[Abd al-Malik II (Samanid emir)|Abd al-Malik II]]. Due to his high position and strong connection with the Samanids, ibn Sina may have found himself in an unfavorable position after the fall of his suzerain.{{sfn|Gutas|1987|pp=67–70}}

It was through the minister of Gurganj, Abu'l-Husayn as-Sahi, a patron of Greek sciences, that Avicenna entered into the service of Abu al-Hasan Ali.{{sfn|Gutas|2014|p=19 (see also note 28)}} Under the Ma'munids, Gurganj became a centre of learning, attracting many prominent figures, such as ibn Sina and his former teacher Abu Sahl al-Masihi, the mathematician Abu Nasr Mansur, the physician ibn al-Khammar, and the [[philologist]] [[al-Tha'alibi]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1978|p=1066}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984a|pp=762–764}}

==== In [[Gorgan]] ====
Avicenna later moved due to "necessity" once more (in 1012), this time to the west. There he travelled through the [[Khurasan]]i cities of [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nasa]], [[Abivard]], [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], [[Samangan, Torbat-e Jam|Samangan]] and [[Jajarm]]. He was planning to visit the ruler of the city of Gorgan, the [[Ziyarid dynasty|Ziyarid]] [[Qabus]] ({{reign|977|981|997|1012}}), a cultivated patron of writing, whose court attracted many distinguished poets and scholars. However, when Avicenna eventually arrived, he discovered that the ruler had been dead since the winter of 1013.{{sfn|Gutas|1987|pp=67–70}}{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=215}} Avicenna then left Gorgan for [[Dihistan]], but returned after becoming ill. There he met [[Abu 'Ubayd al-Juzjani]] (died 1070) who became his pupil and companion.{{sfn|Gutas|1987|pp=67–70}}{{sfn|Gutas|2014|pp=19, 29}} Avicenna stayed briefly in Gorgan, reportedly serving Qabus's son and successor [[Manuchihr]] ({{reign|1012|1031}}) and resided in the house of a patron.{{sfn|Gutas|1987|pp=67–70}}

==== In Ray and Hamadan ====
[[File:Gold dinar of Majd al-Dawla, the last ruler of the Buyid amirate of Ray.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Majd al-Dawla]] ({{reign|997|1029}}), the ''[[amir]]'' (ruler) of the [[Buyid]] branch of [[Ray, Iran|Ray]]]]
In {{circa|1014}}, Avicenna went to the city of [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], where he entered into the service of the [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid amir]] [[Majd al-Dawla]] ({{reign|997|1029}}) and his mother [[Sayyida Shirin]], the ''de facto'' ruler of the realm. There he served as the physician at the court, treating Majd al-Dawla, who was suffering from [[melancholia]]. Avicenna reportedly later served as the "business manager" of Sayyida Shirin in [[Qazvin]] and [[Hamadan]], though details regarding this tenure are unclear.{{sfn|Gutas|1987|pp=67–70}}{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=14}} During this period, Avicenna finished writing ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' and started writing his ''[[The Book of Healing]]''.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=14}}

In 1015, during Avicenna's stay in [[Hamadan]], he participated in a public debate, as was customary for newly arrived scholars in western Iran at that time. The purpose of the debate was to examine one's reputation against a prominent resident.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|pp=15–16}} The person whom Avicenna debated against was Abu'l-Qasim al-Kirmani, a member of the school of philosophers of [[Baghdad]].{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=15}} The debate became heated, resulting in ibn Sina accusing Abu'l-Qasim of lack of basic knowledge in [[logic]], while Abu'l-Qasim accused ibn Sina of impoliteness.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|pp=15–16}}

After the debate, Avicenna sent a letter to the Baghdad Peripatetics, asking if Abu'l-Qasim's claim that he shared the same opinion as them was true. Abu'l-Qasim later retaliated by writing a letter to an unknown person in which he made accusations so serious that ibn Sina wrote to Abu Sa'd, the deputy of Majd al-Dawla, to investigate the matter. The accusation made towards Avicenna may have been the same as he had received earlier, in which he was accused by the people of Hamadan of copying the stylistic structures of the Quran in his ''Sermons on Divine Unity''.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|pp=16–18}} The seriousness of this charge, in the words of the historian Peter Adamson, "cannot be underestimated in the larger Muslim culture."{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=17}}

Not long afterwards, Avicenna shifted his allegiance to the rising Buyid amir [[Shams al-Dawla]], the younger brother of Majd al-Dawla, which Adamson suggests was due to Abu'l-Qasim also working under Sayyida Shirin.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=18}}{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=293}} Avicenna had been called upon by Shams al-Dawla to treat him, but after the latter's campaign in the same year against his former ally, the [[Annazids|Annazid ruler]] Abu Shawk ({{reign|1010|1046}}), he forced Avicenna to become his [[vizier]].{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=18 (see also note 45)}}

Although Avicenna would sometimes clash with Shams al-Dawla's troops, he remained vizier until the latter died of [[colic]] in 1021. Avicenna was asked to stay as vizier by Shams al-Dawla's son and successor [[Sama' al-Dawla]] ({{reign|1021|1023}}), but he instead went into hiding with his patron, Abu Ghalib al-Attar, to wait for better opportunities to emerge. It was during this period that Avicenna was secretly in contact with [[Ala al-Dawla Muhammad]] ({{reign|1008|1041}}), the Kakuyid ruler of [[Isfahan]] and uncle of Sayyida Shirin.{{sfn|Gutas|1987|pp=67–70}}{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=22}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984b|pp=773–774}}

It was during his stay at Attar's home that Avicenna completed ''The Book of Healing'', writing 50 pages a day.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|pp=22–23}} The Buyid court in Hamadan, particularly the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] vizier Taj al-Mulk, suspected Avicenna of correspondence with Ala al-Dawla, and as a result, had the house of Attar ransacked and ibn Sina imprisoned in the fortress of Fardajan, outside Hamadan. Juzjani blames one of ibn Sina's informers for his capture. He was imprisoned for four months until Ala al-Dawla captured Hamadan, ending Sama al-Dawla's reign.{{sfn|Gutas|1987|pp=67–70}}{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=23}}

Avicenna was subsequently released, and went to Isfahan, where he was well received by Ala al-Dawla. In the words of Juzjani, the Kakuyid ruler gave Avicenna "the respect and esteem which someone like him deserved."{{sfn|Gutas|1987|pp=67–70}} Adamson also says that Avicenna's service under Ala al-Dawla "proved to be the most stable period of his life."{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=25}} Avicenna served as the advisor, if not vizier of Ala al-Dawla, accompanying him in many of his military expeditions and travels.{{sfn|Gutas|1987|pp=67–70}}{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=25}} Avicenna dedicated two Persian works to him, a philosophical treatise named ''[[Daneshnameh-ye Alai|Danish-nama-yi Ala'i]]'' ("Book of Science for Ala"), and a medical treatise about the pulse.{{sfn|Lazard|1975|p=630}}

== Philosophy ==

Avicenna wrote extensively on [[early Islamic philosophy]], especially the subjects [[logic]], [[ethics]] and [[metaphysics]], including treatises named ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics''. Most of his works were written in Arabic, then the language of science in the Muslim world, and some in Early New Persian. Of linguistic significance even to this day are a few books that he wrote in Persian, particularly the ''[[Danishnama]]''. Avicenna's commentaries on Aristotle often criticized the philosopher,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Stroumsa |first=Sarah |date=1992 |title=Avicenna's Philosophical Stories: Aristotle's Poetics Reinterpreted |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4057059 |journal=Arabica |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=183–206 |doi=10.1163/157005892X00166 |jstor=4057059 |issn=0570-5398 |access-date=13 October 2022 |archive-date=13 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221013112327/https://www.jstor.org/stable/4057059 |url-status=live }}</ref> encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of [[ijtihad]].

=== Metaphysical doctrine ===
{{Technical|section|date=January 2014}}
Early Islamic philosophy and [[Islamic metaphysics]], imbued as it is with kalam, distinguishes between essence and existence more clearly than Aristotelianism. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Avicenna, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from [[Occasionalism]] can be seen in what is left of his work.

Following [[al-Farabi]]'s lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence ({{langx|ar|ماهية|māhiya|link=no}}) and existence ({{langx|ar|وجود|wujūd|link=no}}). He argued that the fact of existence cannot be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an [[causality|agent-cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.<ref name="Islam in Britannica">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam |access-date=27 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222082832/https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam |archive-date=22 December 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>
====Impossibility, contingency, necessity====
{{see also|Necessity and sufficiency|Contingency (philosophy)|Metaphysical necessity|Potentiality and actuality}}
{{further|Modal logic}}
Avicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (''mumkin bi-dhatihi'') has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (''wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi''). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (''wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi'') is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.<ref>Avicenna, ''Kitab al-shifa', Metaphysics II'', (eds.) G.C. Anawati, Ibrahim Madkour, Sa'id Zayed (Cairo, 1975), p. 36</ref><ref>[[Nader El-Bizri]], "Avicenna and Essentialism," ''Review of Metaphysics'', Vol. 54 (2001), pp.&nbsp;753–778</ref>

====Differentia====
{{see also|Differentia}}
The Necessary exists 'due-to-Its-Self', and has no quiddity/essence other than existence. Furthermore, It is 'One' (''wahid ahad'')<ref>Avicenna, ''Metaphysica of Avicenna'', trans. Parviz Morewedge (New York, 1973), p. 43.</ref> since there cannot be more than one 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' without differentia (fasl) to distinguish them from each other. Yet, to require differentia entails that they exist 'due-to-themselves' as well as 'due to what is other than themselves'; and this is contradictory. <!--However, i-->If no differentia distinguishes them from each other, then, in no sense are these 'Existents' not the same.<ref name="Nader El-Bizri 2000">Nader El-Bizri, ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000)</ref> Avicenna adds that the 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' has no genus (''jins''), nor a definition (''hadd''), nor a counterpart (''nadd''), nor an opposite (''did''), and is detached (''bari'') from matter (''madda''), quality (''kayf''), quantity (''kam''), place (''ayn''), situation (''wad'') and time (''waqt'').<ref>Avicenna, ''Kitab al-Hidaya'', ed.

=== Argument for God's existence ===
{{Main|Proof of the Truthful}}
Avicenna made an [[argument]] for the [[existence of God]] which would be known as the "[[Proof of the Truthful]]" (''wajib al-wujud''). Avicenna argued that there must be a Proof of the Truthful, an entity that cannot ''not'' exist{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=170}} and through a series of arguments, he identified it with [[God in Islam]].{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=171}} Present-day [[History of philosophy|historian of philosophy]] [[Peter Adamson (philosopher)|Peter Adamson]] called this argument one of the most influential medieval arguments for God's existence, and Avicenna's biggest contribution to the history of philosophy.{{sfn|Adamson|2013|p=170}}

=== Al-Biruni correspondence ===
Correspondence between ibn Sina with his student Ahmad ibn ʿAli al-Maʿsumi and [[al-Biruni]] has survived in which they debated Aristotelian [[natural philosophy]] and the Peripatetic school. al-Biruni began by asking eighteen questions, ten of which were criticisms of Aristotle's ''[[On the Heavens]]''.<ref>Rafik Berjak and Muzaffar Iqbal, "Ibn Sina—Al-Biruni correspondence", ''Islam & Science'', June 2003.</ref>

=== Theology ===
Ibn Sina was a devout Muslim and sought to reconcile rational philosophy with Islamic theology. He aimed to prove the existence of God and His creation of the world scientifically and through [[reason]] and [[logic]].<ref name="Goodman-8-9">Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', pp.&nbsp;8–9, [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.</ref> His views on Islamic theology and philosophy were enormously influential, forming part of the core of the curriculum at Islamic religious schools until the 19th century.<ref>James W. Morris (1992), "The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy", in C. Butterworth (ed.), ''The Political Aspects of Islamic Philosophy'', {{ISBN|978-0-932885-07-4}}, Chapter 4, Cambridge [[Harvard University Press]], pp. 152–198 [p. 156].</ref>

Avicenna wrote several short treatises dealing with Islamic theology. These included treatises on the [[prophets and messengers in Islam]], whom he viewed as "inspired philosophers", and also on various scientific and philosophical interpretations of the Quran, such as how [[Cosmology in medieval Islam|Quranic cosmology]] corresponds to his philosophical system. In general, these treatises linked his philosophical writings to Islamic religious ideas; for example, the body's afterlife.

There are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works, however, that Avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion. He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider [[epistemological]] matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.<ref>James W. Morris (1992), "The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy", in C. Butterworth (ed.), ''The Political Aspects of Islamic Philosophy'', Chapter 4, Cambridge [[Harvard University Press]], pp. 152–198 [pp. &nbsp;160–161].</ref>

Later interpretations of Avicenna's philosophy split into three different schools; those (such as [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|al-Tusi]]) who continued to apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances; those (such as [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi|al-Razi]]) who considered Avicenna's theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns; and those (such as [[al-Ghazali]]) who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through a variety of mystical means. It was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al-Razi which eventually came to predominate in the [[madrasah]]s.<ref>James W. Morris (1992), "The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy", in C. Butterworth (ed.), ''The Political Aspects of Islamic Philosophy'', Chapter 4, Cambridge [[Harvard University Press]], pp. 152–198 [pp.&nbsp;156–158].</ref>

Avicenna memorized the Quran by the age of ten, and as an adult, wrote five treatises commenting on [[surah]]s of the Quran. One of these texts included the ''Proof of Prophecies'', in which he comments on several Quranic verses and holds the Quran in high esteem. Avicenna argued that the Islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers.<ref>Jules Janssens (2004), "Avicenna and the Qur'an: A Survey of his Qur'anic commentaries", ''MIDEO'' '''25''', p.&nbsp;177–192.</ref>

Avicenna is generally understood to have been aligned with the Hanafi school of Sunni thought.<ref name="Aisha Khan">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B8k3fsvGRyEC&pg=PA38 |title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina): Muslim physician and philosopher of the eleventh century |last=Aisha Khan |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4042-0509-3 |page=38}}</ref><ref name="Janssens91" /> Avicenna studied Hanafi law, many of his notable teachers were Hanafi jurists, and he served under the Hanafi court of Ali ibn Mamun.<ref>{{Citation |last=DIMITRI GUTAS |publisher=Istituto per l'Oriente C.

=== Thought experiments ===
{{Main|Floating man}}
While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous "[[floating man]]"—literally falling man—a [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul. Avicenna believed his "Floating Man" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance.<ref>See a discussion of this in connection with an analytic take on the philosophy of mind in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Avicenna and the Problem of Consciousness', in ''Consciousness and the Great Philosophers'', eds. S. Leach and [[James Tartaglia|J. Tartaglia]] (London: Routledge, 2016), 45–53</ref> The conceivability of this "Floating Man" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human [[nous|intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates [[truth]] to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. Following is an English translation of the argument:

{{blockquote|One of us (i.e. a human being) should be imagined as having been created in a single stroke; created perfect and complete but with his vision obscured so that he cannot perceive external entities; created falling through air or a void, in such a manner that he is not struck by the firmness of the air in any way that compels him to feel it, and with his limbs separated so that they do not come in contact with or touch each other. Then contemplate the following: can he be assured of the existence of himself? He does not have any doubt in that his self exists, without thereby asserting that he has any exterior limbs, nor any internal organs, neither heart nor brain, nor any one of the exterior things at all; but rather he can affirm the existence of himself, without thereby asserting there that this self has any extension in space. Even if it were possible for him in that state to imagine a hand or any other limb, he would not imagine it as being a part of his self, nor as a condition for the existence of that self; for as you know that which is asserted is different from that which is not asserted and that which is inferred is different from that which is not inferred. Therefore the self, the existence of which has been asserted, is a unique characteristic, in as much that it is not as such the same as the body or the limbs, which have not been ascertained. Thus that which is ascertained (i.e. the self), does have a way of being sure of the existence of the soul as something other than the body, even something non-bodily; this he knows, this he should understand intuitively, if it is that he is ignorant of it and needs to be beaten with a stick [to realize it].|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul<ref name="Nader El-Bizri 2000" /><ref>Ibn Sina, ''الفن السادس من الطبيعيات من كتاب الشفاء القسم الأول'' (Beirut, Lebanon.: M.A.J.D Enterprise Universitaire d'Etude et de Publication S.A.R.L)
{{blockquote|{{lang|ar|يجب أن يتوهم الواحد منا كأنه خلق دفعةً وخلق كاملاً لكنه حجب بصره عن مشاهدة الخارجات وخلق يهوى في هواء أو خلاء هوياً لا يصدمه فيه قوام الهواء صدماً ما يحوج إلى أن يحس وفرق بين أعضائه فلم تتلاق ولم تتماس ثم يتأمل هل أنه يثبت وجود ذاته ولا يشكك في إثباته لذاته موجوداً ولا يثبت مع ذلك طرفاً من أعضائه ولا باطناً من أحشائه ولا قلباً ولا دماغاً ولا شيئاً من الأشياء من خارج بل كان يثبت ذاته ولا يثبت لها طولاً ولا عرضاً ولا عمقاً ولو أنه أمكنه في تلك الحالة أن يتخيل يداً أو عضواً آخر  لم يتخيله جزء من ذاته ولا  شرطاً في ذاته وأنت تعلم أن المثبت غير الذي لم يثبت والمقربه غير الذي لم يقربه فإذن للذات التي أثبت وجودها خاصية على أنها هو بعينه غير جسمه وأعضائه التي لم تثبت فإذن المثبت له سبيل إلى أن يثبته على وجود النفس شيئاً غير الجسم بل غير جسم وأنه عارف به مستشعر له وإن كان ذاهلاً عنه يحتاج إلى أن يقرع عصاه.}}|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul}}</ref>}}

However, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation. Sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal Agent Intellect. The first knowledge of the flying person would be "I am," affirming his or her essence. That essence could not be the body, obviously, as the flying person has no sensation. Thus, the knowledge that "I am" is the core of a human being: the soul exists and is self-aware.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Avicenna's De Anima in the Latin West |last=Hasse |first=Dag Nikolaus |publisher=Warburg Institute |year=2000 |location=London |page=81}}</ref> Avicenna thus concluded that the idea of the [[self (philosophy)|self]] is not logically dependent on any physical [[Object (philosophy)|thing]], and that the soul should not be seen in [[relative term]]s, but as a primary given, a [[substance theory|substance]].

==== Earth sciences ====
Avicenna wrote on [[Earth science]]s such as [[geology]] in ''The Book of Healing''.<ref name="Goodfield">[[Stephen Toulmin]] and [[June Goodfield]] (1965), ''The Ancestry of Science: The Discovery of Time'', p. 64, [[University of Chicago Press]]</ref> While discussing the formation of [[mountain]]s, he explained:

{{blockquote|Either they are the effects of upheavals of the crust of the earth, such as might occur during a violent earthquake, or they are the effect of water, which, cutting itself a new route, has denuded the valleys, the strata being of different kinds, some soft, some hard&nbsp;... It would require a long period of time for all such changes to be accomplished, during which the mountains themselves might be somewhat diminished in size.<ref name=Goodfield />}}

==== Philosophy of science ====
In the ''Al-Burhan'' (''On Demonstration'') section of ''The Book of Healing'', Avicenna discussed the [[philosophy of science]] and described an early [[scientific method]] of [[inquiry]]. He discussed Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' and significantly diverged from it on several points. Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of "How does one acquire the first principles of a science?" He asked how a scientist would arrive at "the initial [[axiom]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?" He explained that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a "relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty". Avicenna then added two further methods for arriving at the [[first principle]]s: the ancient Aristotelian method of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] (''istiqra''), and the method of [[Hypothesis|examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (''tajriba''). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that "it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide." In its place, he developed a "method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McGinnis |first=Jon |date=July 2003 |title=Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam |url=https://irl.umsl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=philosophy-faculty |journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=307–327 |doi=10.1353/hph.2003.0033 |s2cid=30864273 |access-date=24 September 2019 |archive-date=9 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210809100418/https://irl.umsl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=philosophy-faculty |url-status=live  |issn=0022-5053}}</ref>

==== Logic ====
An early formal system of [[temporal logic]] was studied by Avicenna.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012144108/http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 |date=12 October 2007 }}, ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.</ref> Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between ''temporalis'' and the implication.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Temporal Logic: From Ancient Ideas to Artificial Intelligence |last1=Peter Øhrstrøm |last2=Per Hasle |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |page=72}}</ref> Avicenna's work was further developed by [[Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī]] and became the dominant system of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]] until modern times.<ref>{{Citation |first=Tony|last=Street |title=Toward a History of Syllogistic After Avicenna: Notes on Rescher's Studies on Arabic Modal Logic |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=209–228 |year=2000 |doi=10.1093/jis/11.2.209}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00adam |url-access=limited |last=Street |first=Tony |date=1 January 2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52069-0 |editor-last=Peter Adamson |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00adam/page/n265 247]–265 |chapter=Logic |editor-last2=Richard C.

He stated, "Anyone who denies the law of non-contradiction should be beaten and burned until he admits that to be beaten is not the same as not to be beaten, and to be burned is not the same as not to be burned."<ref>Avicenna, Metaphysics, I; commenting on Aristotle, Topics I.11.105a4–5</ref>

==== Physics ====
In [[mechanics]], Avicenna, in ''The Book of Healing'', developed a theory of [[motion (physics)|motion]], in which he made a distinction between the inclination (tendency to motion) and [[force]] of a [[projectile]], and concluded that motion was a result of an inclination (''mayl'') transferred to the projectile by the thrower, and that [[projectile motion]] in a vacuum would not cease.<ref name="Espinoza">Fernando Espinoza (2005). "An analysis of the historical development of ideas about motion and its implications for teaching", ''Physics Education'' '''40''' (2), p. 141.</ref> He viewed inclination as a permanent force whose effect is dissipated by external forces such as [[air resistance]].<ref>A. Sayili (1987), "Ibn Sīnā and Buridan on the Motion of the Projectile", ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''500''' (1), pp. 477–482: "It was a permanent force whose effect got dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance. He is apparently the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion."</ref>

The theory of motion presented by Avicenna was probably influenced by the 6th-century Alexandrian scholar [[John Philoponus]]. Avicenna's is a less sophisticated variant of the [[theory of impetus]] developed by [[Buridan]] in the 14th century. It is unclear if Buridan was influenced by Avicenna, or by Philoponus directly.<ref>Jack Zupko, "John Buridan" in [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], 2014
([http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buridan/notes.html#48 fn. 48] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911164449/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buridan/notes.html#48 |date=11 September 2018 }})
"We do not know precisely where Buridan got the idea of impetus, but a less sophisticated notion of impressed forced can be found in Avicenna's doctrine of mayl (inclination). In this he was possibly influenced by Philoponus, who was developing the Stoic notion of hormé (impulse). For discussion, see Zupko (1997) ['What Is the Science of the Soul? A Case Study in the Evolution of Late Medieval Natural Philosophy,' Synthese, 110(2): 297–334]."</ref>

In [[optics]], Avicenna was among those who argued that light had a speed, observing that "if the perception of [[light]] is due to the emission of some sort of [[Subatomic particle|particles]] by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite."<ref>[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science'', Vol. 1, p. 710.</ref> He also provided a wrong explanation of the [[rainbow]] phenomenon. [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] described Avicenna's ("Ibn Sīnā") theory on the rainbow as follows:

{{blockquote|Independent observation had demonstrated to him that the bow is not formed in the dark cloud but rather in the very thin mist lying between the cloud and the sun or observer. The cloud, he thought, serves as the background of this thin substance, much as a quicksilver lining is placed upon the rear surface of the glass in a mirror. Ibn Sīnā would change the place not only of the bow, but also of the color formation, holding the iridescence to be merely a subjective sensation in the eye.<ref>Carl Benjamin Boyer (1954). "Robert Grosseteste on the Rainbow", ''Osiris'' '''11''', pp.&nbsp;247–258 [248].</ref>}}

In 1253, a Latin text entitled ''Speculum Tripartitum'' stated the following regarding Avicenna's theory on [[heat]]:

{{blockquote|Avicenna says in his book of heaven and earth, that heat is generated from motion in external things.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gutman |first=Oliver |year=1997 |title=On the Fringes of the Corpus Aristotelicum: the Pseudo-Avicenna Liber Celi Et Mundi |journal=Early Science and Medicine |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=109–128 |doi=10.1163/157338297X00087}}</ref>}}

==== Psychology ====
Avicenna's legacy in classical psychology is primarily embodied in the ''Kitab al-nafs'' parts of his ''Kitab al-shifa'' (''The Book of Healing'') and ''Kitab al-najat'' (''The Book of Deliverance''). These were known in Latin under the title [[De Anima]] (treatises "on the soul").{{dubious|date=October 2012}} Notably, Avicenna develops what is called the [[Floating man|Flying Man]] argument in the Psychology of ''The Cure'' I.1.7 as defence of the argument that the soul is without quantitative extension, which has an affinity with [[Descartes]]'s ''cogito'' argument (or what [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] designates as a form of an "''epoche''").<ref name="Nader El-Bizri 2000 pp. 149-171">[[Nader El-Bizri]], ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, NY: Global Publications SUNY, 2000), pp.&nbsp;149–171.</ref><ref name="elbizri67-89">Nader El-Bizri, "Avicenna's De Anima between Aristotle and Husserl," in ''The Passions of the Soul in the Metamorphosis of Becoming'', ed. Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003), pp.&nbsp;67–89.</ref>

Avicenna's psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the soul's individuation, but weak enough to allow for its immortality. Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Avicenna's Psychology. An English translation of Kitāb al-Najāt, Book II, Chapter VI, with Historico-Philosophical Notes and Textual Improvements on the Cairo edition |last=Avicenna |publisher=Oxford University Press, Geoffrey Cumberlege |year=1952 |editor-last=F. Rahman |location=London |page=41}}</ref>

The soul completes the action of intellection by accepting forms that have been abstracted from matter. This process requires a concrete particular (material) to be abstracted into the universal intelligible (immaterial). The material and immaterial interact through the Active Intellect, which is a "divine light" containing the intelligible forms.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Avicenna's Psychology.

Rahman |location=London |pages=68–69}}</ref> The Active Intellect reveals the universals concealed in material objects much like the sun makes colour available to our eyes.

Avicenna wrote an attack on astrology titled ''Missive on the Champions of the Rule of the Stars'' ({{lang|ar|رسالة في ابطال احكم النجوم}}) in which he cited passages from the Quran to dispute the power of astrology to foretell the future.<ref>[[George Saliba]] (1994), ''A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam'', pp. 60, 67–69.

Avicenna's astronomical writings had some influence on later writers, although in general his work could be considered less developed than that of [[ibn al-Haytham]] or al-Biruni. One important feature of his writing is that he considers [[astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|mathematical astronomy]] a separate discipline from astrology.<ref name=Ragep /> He criticized Aristotle's view of the [[star]]s receiving their light from the [[Sun]], stating that the stars are self-luminous, and believed that the planets are also self-luminous.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ariew |first=Roger |date=March 1987 |title=The phases of venus before 1610 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=81–92 |doi=10.1016/0039-3681(87)90012-4|bibcode=1987SHPSA..18...81A }}</ref> He claimed to have observed the [[transit of Venus]]. This is possible as there was a transit on 24 May 1032, but ibn Sina did not give the date of his observation and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus.

He also wrote the ''Summary of the Almagest'' based on Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' with an appended treatise "to bring that which is stated in the Almagest and what is understood from Natural Science into conformity". For example, ibn Sina considers the motion of the solar [[apsis]], which Ptolemy had taken to be fixed.<ref name=Ragep />

=== Chemistry ===
Avicenna was first to derive the attar of flowers from distillation<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMvVBi5EbhMC&q=attar+perfume+muslim&pg=PA70|title=Studies in Islamic Civilization: The Muslim Contribution to the Renaissance|last1=Essa|first1=Ahmed|last2=Ali|first2=Othman|date=2010|publisher=International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT)|isbn=978-1-56564-350-5|language=en|page=70}}</ref> and used [[steam distillation]] to produce essential oils such as rose essence, which he used as [[aromatherapeutic]] treatments for heart conditions.<ref name="Marlene">Marlene Ericksen (2000).

Unlike al-Razi, Avicenna explicitly disputed the theory of the [[Philosopher's stone|transmutation of substances]] commonly believed by [[alchemy|alchemists]]:

{{blockquote|Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.<ref>[[Robert Briffault]] (1938). ''The Making of Humanity'', p.&nbsp;196–197.</ref>}}

Four works on alchemy attributed to Avicenna were translated into [[Latin]] as:<ref name="Anawati">Georges C. Anawati (1996), "Arabic alchemy", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 3, pp.&nbsp;853–885 [875]. [[Routledge]], London and New York.</ref>

{{lang|la|Liber Aboali Abincine de Anima in arte Alchemiae}} was the most influential, having influenced later [[medieval]] chemists and alchemists such as [[Vincent of Beauvais]]. However, Anawati argues (following Ruska) that the de Anima is a fake by a Spanish author. Similarly the Declaratio is believed not to be actually by Avicenna. The third work (''The Book of Minerals'') is agreed to be Avicenna's writing, adapted from the ''Kitab al-Shifa'' (''Book of the Remedy'').<ref name=Anawati /> Avicenna classified minerals into stones, fusible substances, sulfurs and salts, building on the ideas of Aristotle and Jabir.<ref>{{Citation |last=Leicester |first=Henry Marshall |title=The Historical Background of Chemistry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJZVQnqcwv4C&pg=PA70 |page=70 |year=1971 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-61053-5 |quote=There was one famous Arab physician who doubted even the reality of transmutation.

=== Classical Islamic civilization ===
Robert Wisnovsky, a scholar of Avicenna attached to [[McGill University]], says that "Avicenna was the central figure in the long history of the rational sciences in Islam, particularly in the fields of metaphysics, logic and medicine" but that his works didn't only have an influence in these "secular" fields of knowledge alone, as "these works, or portions of them, were read, taught, copied, commented upon, quoted, paraphrased and cited by thousands of post-Avicennian scholars—not only philosophers, logicians, physicians and specialists in the mathematical or exact sciences, but also by those who specialized in the disciplines of [[Kalam|ʿilm al-kalām]] (rational theology, but understood to include [[natural philosophy]], [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of mind]]) and [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|usūl al-fiqh]] (jurisprudence, but understood to include philosophy of law, dialectic, and [[philosophy of language]])."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wisnovsky |first=Robert |date=2012-10-01 |title=Indirect Evidence for Establishing the Text of the Shifā |url=https://brill.com/abstract/journals/orie/40/2/article-p257_4.xml |journal=Oriens |language=en |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=257–258 |doi=10.1163/18778372-00402004 |issn=0078-6527}}</ref>

Avicenna has been recognized by both East and West as one of the great figures in intellectual history.

Along with [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Rhazes]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi|Abulcasis]], [[Ibn al-Nafis]] and [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq|al-Ibadi]], Avicenna is considered an important compiler of early Muslim medicine. He is remembered in the Western [[history of medicine]] as a major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the European [[Renaissance]]. His medical texts were unusual in that where controversy existed between Galen and Aristotle's views on medical matters (such as anatomy), he preferred to side with Aristotle, where necessary updating Aristotle's position to take into account post-Aristotelian advances in anatomical knowledge.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=Avicenna Medicine and Biology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-x |access-date=9 November 2011 |last=Musallam |first=B. |archive-date=1 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201044959/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-x |url-status=live }}</ref> Aristotle's dominant intellectual influence among medieval European scholars meant that Avicenna's linking of Galen's medical writings with Aristotle's philosophical writings in the ''Canon of Medicine'' (along with its comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge) significantly increased Avicenna's importance in medieval Europe in comparison to other Islamic writers on medicine. His influence following translation of the ''Canon'' was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries he was ranked with Hippocrates and Galen as one of the acknowledged authorities, {{lang|la|princeps medicorum}} ("prince of physicians").<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=Avicenna The influence of Avicenna on medical studies in the West |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-x |access-date=9 November 2011 |last=Weisser |first=U. |archive-date=1 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201044959/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-x |url-status=live }}</ref>

In [[Louis L'Amour]]'s 1985 historical novel ''[[The Walking Drum]]'', Kerbouchard studies and discusses Avicenna's ''The Canon of Medicine''.

In his book ''[[The Physician]]'' (1988) [[Noah Gordon (novelist)|Noah Gordon]] tells the story of a young English medical apprentice who disguises himself as a Jew to travel from England to Persia and learn from Avicenna, the great master of his time. The novel was adapted into a feature film, ''[[The Physician (2013 film)|The Physician]]'', in 2013. Avicenna was played by [[Ben Kingsley]].

== List of works ==
The treatises of Avicenna influenced later Muslim thinkers in many areas including theology, philology, mathematics, astronomy, physics and music. His works numbered almost 450 volumes on a wide range of subjects, of which around 240 have survived. In particular, 150 volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and 40 of them concentrate on medicine.<ref name="MacTutor Biography|id=Avicenna" /> His most famous works are ''The Book of Healing'', and ''The Canon of Medicine''.

Avicenna wrote at least one treatise on alchemy, but several others have been falsely attributed to him. His ''Logic'', ''Metaphysics'', ''Physics'', and ''De Caelo'', are treatises giving a synoptic view of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian doctrine]],<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Avicenna|volume=3|pages=62–63}}</ref> though ''Metaphysics'' demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of [[Neoplatonism]] known as Aristotelianism in Avicenna's world; Arabic philosophers{{who|date=February 2015}}{{year needed|date=February 2015}} have hinted at the idea that Avicenna was attempting to "re-Aristotelianise" Muslim philosophy in its entirety, unlike his predecessors, who accepted the conflation of Platonic, Aristotelian, Neo- and Middle-Platonic works transmitted into the Muslim world.

The ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics'' have been extensively reprinted, the latter, e.g., at Venice in 1493, 1495 and 1546. Some of his shorter essays on medicine, logic, etc., take a poetical form (the poem on logic was published by Schmoelders in 1836).<ref>Thought Experiments: Popular Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Physics, Ethics, Computer Science & Mathematics by Fredrick Kennard, p. 115</ref> Two encyclopedic treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger, ''[[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifa']]'' (''Sanatio''), exists nearly complete in manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] and elsewhere; part of it on the ''De Anima'' appeared at Pavia (1490) as the ''Liber Sextus Naturalium'', and the long account of Avicenna's philosophy given by [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa'. A shorter form of the work is known as the An-najat (''Liberatio''). The Latin editions of part of these works have been modified by the corrections which the monastic editors confess that they applied. There is also a {{lang|ar|حكمت مشرقيه|rtl=yes}} (''hikmat-al-mashriqqiyya'', in Latin ''Philosophia Orientalis''), mentioned by [[Roger Bacon]], the majority of which is lost in antiquity, which according to Averroes was pantheistic in tone.<ref name="EB1911" />

=== Persian works ===

Avicenna's most important Persian work is the ''[[Danishnama]]'' ({{lang|fa|دانشنامه علائی}}, "Book of Knowledge". Avicenna created a new scientific vocabulary that had not previously existed in Persian. The ''Danishnama'' covers such topics as logic, metaphysics, music theory and other sciences of his time. It has been translated into English by Parwiz Morewedge in 1977.<ref>Avicenna, Danish Nama-i 'Alai. trans. Parviz Morewedge as ''The Metaphysics of Avicenna'' (New York: Columbia University Press), 1977.</ref> The book is also important in respect to Persian scientific works.

''Andar Dānish-i Rag'' ({{lang|fa|اندر دانش رگ}}, "On the Science of the Pulse") contains nine chapters on the science of the pulse and is a condensed synopsis.

[[Persian poetry]] from Avicenna is recorded in various manuscripts and later anthologies such as ''[[Nozhat al-Majales]]''.

:: This is, on the whole, an informed and good account of the life and accomplishments of one of the greatest influences on the development of thought both Eastern and Western.&nbsp;... It is not as philosophically thorough as the works of D. Saliba, A.M. Goichon, or L. Gardet, but it is probably the best essay in English on this important thinker of the Middle Ages. (Julius R. Weinberg, ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. 69, No. 2, Apr. 1960, pp.&nbsp;255–259)

:: This is a distinguished work which stands out from, and above, many of the books and articles which have been written in this century on Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā) (980–1037). It has two main features on which its distinction as a major contribution to Avicennan studies may be said to rest: the first is its clarity and readability; the second is the comparative approach adopted by the author.&nbsp;...
