==Works==
===''This Life'' (2019)===
In ''[[This Life: Secular Faith and Spiritual Freedom]]'' (2019), Hägglund pursues a critique of the religious ideal of eternity and reconceives faith in secular terms as the fundamental form of practical commitment. Through new interpretations of [[G.W.F. Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], Hägglund develops the social and political stakes of his analysis of our temporal existence, arguing that labor under capitalism alienates us from our finite lifetime. Calling for a revaluation of our values, Hägglund presents a vision of democratic socialism as a post-capitalist form of life in which we could truly own our time and recognize our shared freedom.

===''Dying for Time'' (2012)===
''Dying for Time'' offers new readings of the problem of temporality in the writings of [[Marcel Proust]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[Vladimir Nabokov]]. Through an engagement with [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]], Hägglund also develops an original theory of the relation between time and desire ("chronolibido"), addressing mourning and melancholia, pleasure and pain, attachment and loss.

===''Radical Atheism'' (2008)===
''Radical Atheism'' is a major intervention in [[deconstruction]], offering a novel account of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s thinking of time and space, life and death, good and evil, self and other. As Hägglund argues, all our commitments presuppose an investment in and care for finite life. Developing a deconstructive account of time, Hägglund shows how Derrida rethinks the constitution of identity, ethics, religion, and political emancipation in accordance with the condition of temporal finitude.

==Personal Life==
(Hans Martin) Hägglund, was born November 23, 1976 in [[Sollentuna Parish|Sollentuna]] parish, [[Stockholm]] county and grew up in [[Viksjö]] in [[Järfälla]] municipality and the [[High Coast]].
