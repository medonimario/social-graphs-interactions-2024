'''Arnold Gehlen''' (29 January 1904 in [[Leipzig]], [[German Empire]] &ndash; 30 January 1976 in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany]]) was an influential [[conservativism|conservative]] German philosopher, sociologist, and anthropologist.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berger |first1=Peter L. |last2=Kellner |first2=Hansfried |title=Arnold Gehlen and the Theory of Institutions |journal=Social Research |date=1965 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=110–115 |jstor=40969770 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |issn=0037-783X}}</ref>

== Biography ==
Gehlen's major influences while studying philosophy were [[Hans Driesch]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]] and especially [[Max Scheler]].
Furthermore, he was heavily influenced by [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and US-American [[pragmatism]]: [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]] and especially [[George Herbert Mead]].

In 1933 Gehlen signed the ''[[Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State]]''. Although he joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933 and made a career as a member of the '[[Leipzig school (sociology)|Leipzig School]]' under [[Hans Freyer]], he was a political opportunist: his main work ''Der Mensch'' appeared in 1940 and was published in English translation in 1987 as ''Man. His Nature and Place in the World''. Gehlen was a modernist conservative who accepted the cultural changes brought about by the industrial revolution and by mass society (see his ''Man in the age of technology'', Chapter V).

Gehlen succeeded [[Paul Tillich]], who emigrated to the U.S., at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]]. In 1938 he accepted a teaching position at the [[University of Königsberg]] (today's [[Kaliningrad]]) and then taught at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1940 until he was drafted into the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' in 1943. After undergoing [[denazification]] he taught at the administrative college in [[Speyer]]. He went on to teach at the [[RWTH Aachen|Aachen University of Technology]] between 1962 and 1969. Gehlen became a sharp critic of the [[protest]] movements that developed in the late 1960s.

He was the cousin of [[Reinhard Gehlen]], the founder and president of the West German [[Federal Intelligence Service]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winkler |first1=Willi |title=Reinhard und Arnold Gehlen: Die Verschwörung |url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/arnold-gehlen-bochum-bnd-1.5251740?reduced=true |website=Süddeutsche Zeitung |access-date=16 June 2023 |date=31 March 2021}}</ref>

== Main ideas ==

Gehlen's core idea in ''Der Mensch'' is that humans have unique properties which distinguish them from all other species: world-openness ([[:de:Weltoffenheit]]), a concept originally coined by [[Max Scheler]], which describes the ability of humans to adapt to various environments as contrasted with animals, which can only survive in environments which match their evolutionary specialisation. This world-openness gives us the ability to shape our environment according to our intentions, and it comprises a view of language as a way of acting (Gehlen was one of the first proponents of speech act theory), an excess of impulses and the ability of self-control. These properties allow us—in contrast to all other animals—to create our own (for example cultural) environments, though this is also at the risk of a certain self-destabilisation.
Gehlen's philosophy has influenced many contemporary German thinkers in a range of disciplines, including [[Peter L. Berger]], [[Thomas Luckmann]] and [[Niklas Luhmann]] in sociology, and [[Hans Blumenberg]] in philosophy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roughley |first1=Neil |editor1-last=Lutz |editor1-first=Bernd |title=Metzler Philosophen-Lexikon : von den Vorsokratikern bis zu den Neuen Philosophen |date=2015 |publisher=Metzler |location=Stuttgart |isbn=978-3-476-02609-5 |pages=245–248 |edition=3 |language=de |chapter=Arnold Gehlen |doi=10.1007/978-3-476-01402-3}}</ref> Since the mid-2010s, there has occurred a Gehlen revival based in part on the predictions in his book ''[[Moral und Hypermoral]]'' as concerns the development of German (and Western) politics from 1969. Two examples of his work - "On culture, nature and naturalness" and "Man and Institutions" - are included in the anthology of conservative social and political thought published by Jerry Z. Muller in 1997.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Muller |editor1-first=Jerry Z. |title=Conservatism: An Anthology of Social and Political Thought from David Hume to the Present |date=1997 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691-03712-7 |pages=401{{Hyphen}}420 |chapter=Between social science and cultural criticism |doi=10.2307/j.ctvzxx929.15 |jstor=j.ctvzxx929.15|last1=Gehlen |first1=Arnold |s2cid=218944528 }}</ref>

=== ''Post-histoire'' ===
As early as 1952 Gehlen adopted the expression ''post-histoire''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Niethammer |first1=Lutz |last2=van Laak |first2=Dirk |others=Translated by Patrick Camiller |title=Posthistoire.

He first used the term to designate an epoch characterized by a state of stability and rigidity, devoid of utopian ideas, change, or development. In 1961, in an article appropriately entitled ''Über kulturelle Kristallisation''<ref>{{cite book |last=Gehlen |first=Arnold |author-link=Arnold Gehlen |chapter=Über kulturelle Kristallisation |title=Studien zur Anthropologie und Soziologie |year=1963 |location=Neuwied/Berlin |publisher=Luchterhand Verlag |pages=311{{Hyphen}}328 |language=de}} [https://majawicki.ch/archive/3819 Text] at Maja Wicki Archive.</ref> ({{lit}} "On Cultural Crystallization"), Gehlen wrote: "I am predicting that the history of ideas has come to an end and that we have arrived at the epoch of ''post-histoire'', so that now the advice [[Gottfried Benn]] gave the individual, 'Make do with what you have,' is valid for humanity as a whole".<ref>{{cite book |last=Kaes |first=Anton |title=From Hitler to Heimat.
