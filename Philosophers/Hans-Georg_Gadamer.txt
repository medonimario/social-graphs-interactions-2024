'''Hans-Georg Gadamer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|d|ə|m|ər}}; {{IPA|de|ˈɡaːdamɐ|lang}}; 11 February 1900&nbsp;– 13 March 2002) was a German [[philosopher]] of the [[Continental philosophy|continental tradition]], best known for his 1960 {{lang|la|[[magnum opus]]}} on [[hermeneutics]], ''[[Truth and Method]]'' (''Wahrheit und Methode'').

==Life==

===Family and early life===
Gadamer was born in [[Marburg]], [[German Empire|Germany]],{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=12}} the son of Johannes Gadamer (1867–1928),{{sfn|Grondin|2003|pp=26, 33}} a pharmaceutical [[chemistry]] professor who later also served as the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Marburg]]. He was raised a Protestant Christian.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gadamer|first1=Hans-Georg|title=The Relevance of the Beautiful and Other Essays|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521339537|page=35|url=http://timothyquigley.net/ipa/gadamer-rb.pdf|access-date=16 January 2018|quote=As a Protestant, I have always found especially significant the controversy over the Last Supper, which raged in the Protestant Church, particularly between Luther and Zwingli.}}</ref> Gadamer resisted his father's urging to take up the [[natural sciences]] and became more and more interested in the [[humanities]]. His mother, Emma Karoline Johanna Geiese (1869–1904) died of [[diabetes]] while Hans-Georg was four years old, and he later noted that this may have had an effect on his decision not to pursue scientific studies. [[Jean Grondin]] describes Gadamer as finding in his mother "a poetic and almost religious counterpart to the iron fist of his father".{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=21}} Gadamer did not serve during [[World War I]] for reasons of ill health{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=45}} and similarly was exempted from serving during [[World War II]] due to [[polio]].{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=46}}

===Education===
He later studied classics and [[philosophy]] in the [[University of Breslau]]{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=37}} under [[Richard Hönigswald]], but soon moved back to the University of Marburg to study with the [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers [[Paul Natorp]] (his [[doctoral thesis]] advisor) and [[Nicolai Hartmann]]. He defended his [[dissertation]] ''The Essence of Pleasure in Plato's Dialogues'' ({{lang|de|Das Wesen der Lust nach den Platonischen Dialogen}}) in 1922.{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=5–7}}

Shortly thereafter, Gadamer moved to [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg University]] and began studying with [[Martin Heidegger]], who was then a promising young scholar who had not yet received a professorship. He became close to Heidegger, and when Heidegger received a position at [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], Gadamer followed him there, where he became one of a group of students such as [[Leo Strauss]], [[Karl Löwith]], and [[Hannah Arendt]]. It was Heidegger's influence that gave Gadamer's thought its distinctive cast and led him away from the earlier neo-Kantian influences of Natorp and Hartmann. Gadamer studied Aristotle both under [[Edmund Husserl]] and under Heidegger.{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=7–8}}

===Early career===
Gadamer [[habilitation|habilitated]] in 1929 and spent most of the early 1930s lecturing in Marburg. Unlike Heidegger, who joined the [[Nazi Party]] in May 1933 and continued as a member until the party was dissolved following World War II, Gadamer was silent on [[Nazism]], and he was not politically active during [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]]. Gadamer did not join the Nazis, and he did not serve in the army because of the polio he had contracted in 1922. He joined the [[National Socialist Teachers League]] in August 1933.<ref>Ideologische Mächte im deutschen Faschismus Band 5: Heidegger im Kontext: Gesamtüberblick zum NS-Engagement der Universitätsphilosophen, George Leaman, Rainer Alisch, Thomas Laugstien, Verlag: Argument Hamburg, 1993, p. 105, {{ISBN|3886192059}}</ref>

In 1933 Gadamer signed the ''[[Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State]]''.

In April 1937 he became a temporary professor at Marburg,{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=17}} then in 1938 he received a professorship at [[Leipzig University]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dostal|first=Robert|title=The Cambridge Companion to Gadamer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Byz-nfrKQkC&pg=PA21|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521000416|page=20}}</ref> From an ''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]''-point of view Gadamer was classified as neither supportive nor disapproving in the "''SD-Dossiers über Philosophie-Professoren"'' (i.e. SD-files concerning philosophy professors) that were set up by the [[Sicherheitsdienst|''SS''-Security-Service (SD)]].<ref>Leaman, Georg / Simon, Gerd: Deutsche Philosophen aus der Sicht des Sicherheitsdienstes des Reichsführers SS. Jahrbuch für Soziologie-Geschichte 1992, pages 261–292</ref> In 1946, he was found by the American occupation forces to be untainted by Nazism and named rector of the university.<!-- Please add this bit of the German Wikipedia properly into the article. Thanks. (But cf. German Wikipedia article, which notes [citing Ernst Klee: ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945'', Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2005, p.&nbsp;172] that on Nov. 11th, 1933 he signed the "declaration of loyalty to Adolf Hitler;" in 1937 he received a professorship in Marburg; in 1939 he became a full professor and director of an institute in Leipzig; and during the war he was involved in the "Humanities' contribution to the war effort" project:  http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Georg_Gadamer.) -->

The level of Gadamer's involvement with the Nazis has been disputed in the works of [[Richard Wolin]]<ref>Richard Wolin, ‚Nazism and the complicities of Hans-Georg Gadamer. Untruth and Method', ''The New Republic'', 15 May 2000, pp. 36–45</ref> and Teresa Orozco.{{sfn|Orozco|1995}} Orozco alleges, with reference to Gadamer's published works, that Gadamer had supported the Nazis more than scholars had supposed. Gadamer scholars have rejected these assertions: [[Jean Grondin]] has said that Orozco is engaged in a "witch-hunt"{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=165}} while [[Donatella Di Cesare]] said that "the archival material on which Orozco bases her argument is actually quite negligible".{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=30}} Cesare and Grondin have argued that there is no trace of [[antisemitism]] in Gadamer's work, and that Gadamer maintained friendships with Jews and provided shelter for nearly two years for the philosopher [[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]] in 1933 and 1934.{{sfn|Grondin|2003|pp=153–154}} Gadamer also reduced his contact with Heidegger during the Nazi era.{{sfn|Cesare|2007|pp=14–15}}

===At Heidelberg===
Communist [[East Germany]] was less to Gadamer's liking than [[Nazi Germany]], so he left for West Germany, accepting first a position in [[Goethe University Frankfurt]] and then the succession of [[Karl Jaspers]] in the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1949. He remained in this position, as emeritus, until his death in 2002 at the age of 102.<ref name="washingtonpost_obit">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A35910-2002Mar15 | title=Hans-Georg Gadamer Dies; Noted German Philosopher | access-date=25 March 2011 | date=16 March 2002 | newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref><ref name="guardian_obit">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/18/guardianobituaries.obituaries | title=Hans-Georg Gadamer | access-date=25 March 2011 | author=Roberts, Julian | date=18 March 2002 | work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name="independent_obit">{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hansgeorg-gadamer-729860.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012053133/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hansgeorg-gadamer-729860.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=12 October 2011 | title=Hans-Georg Gadamer | access-date=25 March 2011 | date=26 March 2002 | work=The Independent}}</ref> He was also an Editorial Advisor of the journal ''[[Dionysius (journal)|Dionysius]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classics.dal.ca/Journals/Dionysius/Editorial_Board.php|title=Department of Classics|website=Dalhousie University}}</ref> It was during this time that he completed his ''[[magnum opus]]'', ''Truth and Method'' (1960), and engaged in his famous debate with [[Jürgen Habermas]] over the possibility of transcending history and culture in order to find a truly objective position from which to critique society. The debate was inconclusive, but marked the beginning of warm relations between the two men. It was Gadamer who secured Habermas's first professorship in the University of Heidelberg.

In 1968, Gadamer invited [[Tomonobu Imamichi]] for lectures at Heidelberg, but their relationship became very cool after Imamichi alleged that Heidegger had taken his concept of ''[[Dasein]]'' out of [[Okakura Kakuzo]]'s concept of ''das in-der-Welt-sein'' (to be in the [[being in the world]]) expressed in ''[[The Book of Tea]]'', which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year before.<ref name="Imamichi">{{cite web |first1=Tomonobu |last1=Imamichi |title=In Search of Wisdom.

In 1981, Gadamer attempted to engage with [[Jacques Derrida]] at a conference in Paris but it proved less enlightening because the two thinkers had little in common. A last meeting between Gadamer and Derrida was held at the Stift of Heidelberg in July 2001, coordinated by Derrida's students Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} This meeting marked, in many ways, a turn in their philosophical encounter. After Gadamer's death, Derrida called their failure to find common ground one of the worst debacles of his life and expressed, in the main obituary for Gadamer, his great personal and philosophical respect. [[Richard J. Bernstein]] said that "[a] genuine dialogue between Gadamer and Derrida has never taken place. This is a shame because there are crucial and consequential issues that arise between hermeneutics and deconstruction".<ref>{{Cite book|author=Richard J. Bernstein|chapter=Hermeneutics, Critical Theory and Deconstruction|title=The Cambridge Companion to Gadamer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521801931}}</ref>

===Honorary doctorates===
Gadamer received honorary doctorates from the [[University of Bamberg]], the [[University of Wrocław]], [[Boston College]], [[Charles University in Prague]], [[Hamilton College]], the [[University of Leipzig]], the [[University of Marburg]] (1999) the [[University of Ottawa]], [[Saint Petersburg State University]] (2001), the [[University of Tübingen]] and [[University of Washington]].{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=27}}

===Death===
On 11 February 2000, the [[University of Heidelberg]] celebrated Gadamer's one hundredth birthday with a ceremony and conference. Gadamer's last academic engagement was in the summer of 2001 at an annual symposium on hermeneutics that two of Gadamer's American students had organised. On 13 March 2002, Gadamer died at Heidelberg's University Clinic at the age of 102.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/fdomauricio/Gadamer.htm |title=Hans-Georg Gadamer, 1900–2002 |last=Marucio |first=Fernando |access-date=21 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018215428/http://geocities.com/fdomauricio/Gadamer.htm |archive-date=18 October 2009 |language=es |work=Geocities}}</ref> He is buried in the Köpfel cemetery in [[Ziegelhausen]].{{sfn|Cesare|2007|pp=27–28}}

==Work==

===Philosophical hermeneutics and ''Truth and Method''===
Gadamer's philosophical project, as explained in ''[[Truth and Method]]'', was to elaborate on the concept of "[[Hermeneutics|philosophical hermeneutics]]", which Heidegger initiated but never dealt with at length. Gadamer's goal was to uncover the nature of human understanding. In ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer argued that "truth" and "method" were at odds with one another. For Gadamer, "the experience of art is exemplary in its provision of truths that are inaccessible by scientific methods, and this experience is projected to the whole domain of human sciences."<ref>Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2016), "The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity," Lexington Books, {{ISBN|978-1498524568}}</ref> He was critical of two approaches to the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]en''). On the one hand, he was critical of modern approaches to humanities that modeled themselves on the natural sciences, which simply sought to "objectively" observe and analyze texts and art. On the other hand, he took issue with the traditional German approaches to the humanities, represented for instance by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], who believed that meaning, as an object, could be found within a text through a particular process that allowed for a connection with the author's thoughts that led to the creation of a text (Schleiermacher),{{sfn|Schleiermacher|Wojcik|Haas|1978|pp=5, 10}} or the situation that led to an expression of human inner life (Dilthey).{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=98}}

However, Gadamer argued meaning and understanding are not objects to be found through certain methods, but are inevitable phenomena.{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=163}} Hermeneutics is not a process in which an interpreter finds a particular meaning, but "a philosophical effort to account for understanding as an ontological—the ontological—process of man."{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=163}} Thus, Gadamer is not giving a prescriptive method on how to understand, but rather he is working to examine how understanding, whether of texts, artwork, or experience, is possible at all. Gadamer intended ''Truth and Method'' to be a description of what we always do when we interpret things (even if we do not know it): "My real concern was and is philosophic: not what we do or what we ought to do, but what happens to us over and above our wanting and doing".<ref>Truth and Method 2nd ed. Sheed and Ward, London 1989 XXVIII</ref>

As a result of [[Martin Heidegger]]'s temporal analysis of human existence, Gadamer argued that people have a so-called historically effected [[consciousness]] (''wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewußtsein''), and that they are embedded in the particular history and culture that shaped them. However the historical consciousness is not an object over and against our existence, but "a stream in which we move and participate, in every act of understanding."{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=117}} Therefore, people do not come to any given thing without some form of preunderstanding established by this historical stream. The tradition in which an interpreter stands establishes "prejudices" that affect how he or she will make interpretations. For Gadamer, these prejudices are not something that hinders our ability to make interpretations, but are both integral to the reality of being, and "are the basis of our being able to understand history at all."{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=182}} Gadamer criticized Enlightenment thinkers for harboring a "prejudice against prejudices".{{sfn|Gonzales|2006|p=328}}

For Gadamer, interpreting a text involves a [[fusion of horizons]] (''Horizontverschmelzung''). Both the text and the interpreter find themselves within a particular historical tradition, or "horizon." Each horizon is expressed through the medium of language, and both text and interpreter belong to and participate in history and language. This "belongingness" to language is the common ground between interpreter and text that makes understanding possible. As an interpreter seeks to understand a text, a common horizon emerges. This fusion of horizons does not mean the interpreter now fully understands some kind of objective meaning, but is "an event in which a world opens itself to him."{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=209}} The result is a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

Gadamer further explains the hermeneutical experience as a dialogue. To justify this, he uses [[Plato#The dialogues|Plato's dialogues]] as a model for how we are to engage with written texts. To be in conversation, one must take seriously "the truth claim of the person with whom one is conversing."{{sfn|Gonzales|2006|pp=322–323}} Further, each participant in the conversation relates to one another insofar as they belong to the common goal of understanding one another.{{sfn|Gonzales|2006|p=323}} Ultimately, for Gadamer, the most important dynamic of conversation as a model for the interpretation of a text is "the give-and-take of question and answer."{{sfn|Gonzales|2006|p=323}} In other words, the interpretation of a given text will change depending on the questions the interpreter asks of the
text. The "meaning" emerges not as an object that lies in the text or in the interpreter, but rather an event that results from the interaction of the two.

''Truth and Method'' was published twice in English, and the revised edition is now considered authoritative. The German-language edition of Gadamer's Collected Works includes a volume in which Gadamer elaborates his argument and discusses the critical response to the book. Finally, Gadamer's essay on [[Paul Celan|Celan]] (entitled "Who Am I and Who Are You?") has been considered by many—including Heidegger and Gadamer himself—as a "second volume" or continuation of the argument in ''Truth and Method''.

====Contributions to communication ethics====
Gadamer's ''Truth and Method'' has become an authoritative work in the [[communication ethics]] field, spawning several prominent ethics theories and guidelines. The most profound of these is the formulation of the dialogic coordinates, a standard set of prerequisite communication elements necessary for inciting dialogue. Adhering to Gadamer's theories regarding bias, communicators can better initiate dialogic transaction, allowing biases to merge and promote mutual understanding and learning.<ref name="ReferenceA">Communication Ethics Literacy: Dialogue and Difference Arnett, Harden Fritz & Bell, Los Angeles 2009</ref>

===Other works===
Gadamer also added philosophical substance to the notion of human health. In ''The Enigma of Health'', Gadamer explored what it means to heal, as a patient and a provider. In this work the practice and art of medicine are thoroughly examined, as is the inevitability of any cure.<ref name="Dostal-intro">{{Cite book|author=Robert J. Dostal|chapter=Introduction|title=The Cambridge Companion to Gadamer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521801931}}</ref>

In addition to his work in hermeneutics, Gadamer is also well known for a long list of publications on Greek philosophy. Indeed, while ''Truth and Method'' became central to his later career, much of Gadamer's early life centered on studying Greek thinkers, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] specifically. In the Italian introduction to ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer said that his work on Greek philosophy was "the best and most original part" of his career.{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=1}} His book ''Plato's Dialectical Ethics'' looks at the ''[[Philebus]]'' dialogue through the lens of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]].<ref name="Dostal-intro" />
