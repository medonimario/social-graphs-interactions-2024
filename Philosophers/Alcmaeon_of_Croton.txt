==Biography==
Alcmaeon was born in [[Crotone|Croton]], [[Magna Graecia]], and was the son of Peirithous.<ref name="Stanford"/> Alcmaeon is said by some to have been a pupil of [[Pythagoras]], and he is believed to have been born c. 510 BC.<ref>"There is disagreement about the date of his birth: Aristotle says that "Alcmaeon of Croton lived when Pythagoras was old," [''Metaphysics'', 1, v, 30, 986a] but it would appear that the passage is interpolated. Diogenes Laertius states that he was a disciple of Pythagoras, [viii. 83] and this could have been possible if we assume that the latter died about 490 and that Alcmaeon was born about 510 BC." Plinio Prioreschi, (1996), ''A History of Medicine: Greek medicine'', page 167.</ref> Although he wrote primarily about medical topics, there is some suggestion that he was a philosopher of science, not a physician. He also practiced [[astrology]] and [[meteorology]].  Nothing more is known of the events of his life.<ref name="DGRBM">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Greenhill |first=William Alexander |title=Alcmaeon (3) |editor=William Smith |editor-link=William Smith (lexicographer) |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |pages=104–105 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=Boston |year=1867 |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0113.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111194352/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0113.html |archive-date=2013-11-11 }}</ref>

==Work==
During Alcmaeon's time, the medical school in [[Magna Graecia]] was regarded as the most famous; illnesses were studied in a scientific and experimental manner.<ref name="Aliberti2010"/> Alcmaeon was considered by many an early pioneer and advocate of [[anatomy|anatomical]] [[dissection]] and was said to be the first to identify [[Eustachian tube]]s.  His celebrated discoveries in the field of dissection were noted in antiquity, but whether his knowledge in this branch of science was derived from the dissection of animals or of human bodies is disputed.<ref>''Dict. of Ant.'', p. 756, a</ref>  [[Calcidius]], on whose authority the fact rests, merely says "''qui primus exsectionem aggredi est ausus''," and the word ''exsectio'' would apply equally well in either case;<ref>[[Calcidius]], ''Comment. in Plat. "Tim."'' p. 368, ed. Fabr.</ref> some modern scholars doubt Calcidius' word entirely.<ref name="OCD">{{Cite book |last=Owen |first=Gwilym Ellis Lane |contribution=Alcmaeon (2) |editor-last=Hornblower |editor-first=Simon |title=Oxford Classical Dictionary |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |place=Oxford |year=1996 |title-link=Oxford Classical Dictionary }}</ref>

Alcmaeon also was the first to dwell on the internal causes of illnesses. It was he who first suggested that health was a state of equilibrium between opposing [[four humors|humors]] and that illnesses were because of problems in environment, [[nutrition]] and lifestyle. A book titled ''On Nature'' is attributed to him, though the original title may be different, as Alexandrian writers were known to have ascribed the title "On Nature" to a wide variety of works.   According to [[Favorinus]]'s account, Alcmaeon has been the first who wrote such a treatise on natural philosophy ({{lang|grc|φυσικὸν λόγον}}),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 83}}<ref>[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata]]'' i. p. 308</ref> however this has been disputed, because [[Anaximander]] wrote before Alcmaeon.<ref name="Stanford"/> Accounts which attribute an Alcmaeon of Croton to be the first to write animal [[fable]]s,<ref>''fabulas'', Isid. ''Orig.'' i. 39</ref> may be a reference to a poet with the same name.<ref name="Stanford"/>  He also wrote several other medical and philosophical works, of which nothing but the titles and a few fragments have been preserved by [[Stobaeus]],<ref>[[Stobaeus]], ''Eclog. Phys.''</ref> [[Plutarch]],<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''De Phys. Philos. Decr.''</ref> and [[Galen]].<ref>[[Galen]], ''Histor. Philosoph.''</ref>

Surviving fragments attributed to Alcmaeon include, "The earth is the mother of plants and the sun their father", and maybe also, "Experience is the beginning of learning", attributed to an Spartan poet named Alcman.

===Study of the senses===
[[Theophrastus]] in his ''De Sensu'' offers a summary of the [[Physiology|physiological science]] of Alcmaeon,<ref>Theophrastus, ''De Sensu''. 25.</ref> where his positions regarding the ability to understand being what separates man from animals, the way in which each individual sense operates and the brain being the center of activity for thought and senses, are mentioned.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Guthri |first=W. K. C. |title=A History of Greek Philosophy |date=1971 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=London |pages=347}}</ref> Alcmaeon differed from his contemporaries in several ways. While [[Empedocles]] held that sensations resulted from interactions between likes with the residence of the [[mind]] being in the [[heart]], Alcmaeon concluded that sensations were born out of interactions between unlikes and the seat of the mind was the head. He further disagreed with Empidocles regarding the identity between sensation and thought, and he drew a clear distinction between them.<ref name=":2">Guthri, W. K. C. (1971). ''A History of Greek Philosophy''. London: Cambridge University Press. p. 348.</ref> This served as a defining difference between animals who can only sense, and the superior man who can also think, a notion accepted and confirmed by [[Aristotle]].<ref>Aristotle, ''De Anima''. 11:3.</ref><ref name=":2" />

[[Calcidius]]' commentary on [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' praises Alcmaeon, [[Callisthenes]], and [[Herophilus]] for their work on the nature of the eye. He mentions that Alcmaeon excised an animal eye to study the optic nerve. However, there is no evidence that Alcmaeon himself dissected the eye or the skull. Based on this observation, and more rudimentary, Alcmaeon described the senses, except for the touch sense.  These observations contributed to the study of medicine by establishing the connection between the brain and the sense organs, and outlined the paths of the optic nerves as well as stating that the brain is the organ of the mind. Many scholars believe that Plato referred to Alcmaeon's work, when writing in [[Phaedo]] about the senses and how we or animals think.  He also stated that the eye contains both fire and water, with vision occurring once something is seen and reflected by the gleaming and translucent part of the eye.<ref name="Franco2013">{{cite journal|title=Animal Experiments in Biomedical Research: A Historical Perspective|doi=10.3390/ani3010238|pmid=26487317|journal=Animals|volume=3|issue=1|pages=238–273|year=2013|author=Nuno Henrique Franco|pmc=4495509|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="Stanford" />

===Other studies===
Alcmaeon said that sleep occurs by the withdrawal of blood, away from the surface of the body, to larger blood-flowing vessels, and that one becomes awake again once the blood returns. And if the blood withdraws entirely, death occurs. It has been suggested that Hippocratic authors, and [[Aristotle]], adopted Alcmaeon's views on sleep.<ref name="Lyons">Albert S. Lyons, M.D., F.A.C.S., R. Joseph Petrucelli, II, M.D., ''Medicine: An Illustrated History'', pp. 187, 192</ref><ref>A further account of his philosophical opinions may be found in [[Gilles Ménage]]'s Notes to Diogenes Laertius, viii. 83, p. 387; Le Clerc, ''Hist. de la Med.''; [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]] ''ap. Fabric. Biblioth. Graec.'' vol. xiii. p. 48, ed. vet.; Sprengel, ''Hist. de la Med.'' vol. i. p. 239; C. G. Kühn, ''De Philosoph. ante Hippocr. Medicinae Cultor.'' Lips. 1781, [[4to]]., reprinted in Ackermann's ''Opusc. ad Histor. Medic. Pertinentia'', Norimb. 1797, [[8vo]]., and in Kühn's ''Opusc. Acad. Med. et Philol.'' Lips. 1827-8, 2 vols. [[8vo]].; Isensee, ''Gesch. der Medicin.''</ref> There are also accounts of him about embryology, how a child develops, and analogies with animals and plants about human physiology. 

Based on Theophrastus, [[Cicero]] and [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]] refer to Alcmaeon as believing that the celestial bodies were divine, and [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] presents the argument for the soul's immortality due to its continuous autonomous motion. These ideas in themselves were not innovative, for the notion of the eternal self-caused motion of nature served the arguments of [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] and the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorians]] and the divinity of heavenly bodies was well accepted in [[Ancient Greek religion|popular religion]], but Alcmaeon was unique in that he presented them in a logical fashion.<ref>Guthri, W. K. C. (1971). ''A History of Greek Philosophy''. London: Cambridge University Press. p. 350.</ref> Both these ideas are related to the core image of circular motion, and especially the circular character of time, as were seen in the revolutions of the heavenly bodies as they are related to the circular repetitions of events on earth, such as the [[Season|seasonal changes]] orchestrated by the sun.<ref name=":3">Guthri, W. K. C. (1971). ''A History of Greek Philosophy''. London: Cambridge University Press. pp. 351-352.</ref> The notion of circularity was further applied to such varied areas as [[geometry]], [[Ancient Greek astronomy|astronomy]], [[chronology]], [[history]] and [[physiology]].<ref name=":3" /> It in this context that Alcmaeon is quoted as saying "that the reason why men die is they cannot join the beginning and the end". The soul, in its action on the body, imitates the eternal circular motions of the divine stars with life being dependent on the circular integration of all parts into one continuous whole.<ref>Guthri, W. K. C. (1971). ''A History of Greek Philosophy''. London: Cambridge University Press. pp. 351-353.</ref> 

Because of the little evidence, there exists controversy to what extent Alcmaeon can be considered as a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Presocratic]] [[Cosmology|cosmologist]], or if at all.<ref name="Stanford" />

==Pythagorean==
Although Alcmaeon is often described as a pupil of [[Pythagoras]], there are reasons to doubt whether he was a Pythagorean at all;<ref name="DGRBM2">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jowett |first=Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin Jowett |title=Alcmaeon (3) |editor=William Smith |editor-link=William Smith (lexicographer) |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |pages=105 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=Boston |year=1867 |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0114.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521035835/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0114.html |archive-date=2008-05-21 }}</ref> his name seems to have crept into lists of Pythagoreans given us by later writers.<ref name="cab">[[Christian August Brandis]], ''Geschichte der Philosophie'' vol. i. p. 507-508</ref>  [[Aristotle]] mentions him as nearly contemporary with Pythagoras, but distinguishes between the ''stoicheia'' ({{lang|grc|στοιχεῖα}}) of opposites, under which the Pythagoreans included all things;<ref>[[Aristotle]], ''Metaphysics'' A. 5</ref> and the double principle of Alcmaeon, according to Aristotle, less extended, although he does not explain the precise difference. Since 1950 the scholarly consensus holds that Alcmaeon of Croton is a figure independent of the Pythagoreans.<ref name="Stanford"/>

Other doctrines of Alcmaeon have been preserved.  He said that the human soul was [[Immortality|immortal]] and partook of the divine nature, because like the heavenly bodies it contained in itself a principle of motion.<ref>[[Aristotle]], ''de Anima'', i. 2, p. 405</ref><ref>[[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' i. 11</ref>  The [[eclipse]] of the moon, which was also eternal, he supposed to arise from its shape, which he said was like a boat.  All his doctrines which have come down to us relate to physics or medicine; and seem to have arisen partly out of the speculations of the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]], with which rather than the Pythagorean, Aristotle appears to connect Alcmaeon, partly from the traditional lore of the earliest medical science.<ref name="cab"/>

=== Modern influence ===
Alcmaeon of Croton, an ancient Greek [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[physician]], and [[scientist]] who lived during the 5th century BCE, is widely regarded as one of the founders of the medical tradition in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and made some significant contributions to the fields of anatomy and physiology and the overall field of medicine as well. Alcmaeon's work had a large impact on the development of Western medicine and science. His ideas continue to influence our understanding of the human body and mind today.

One of Alcmaeon's most significant contributions to medicine was his understanding of the [[brain]] and the role that it played in human physiology. He was one of the first people to recognize the importance of the brain as the point of intelligence and [[consciousness]] (or [[soul]]).<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Celesia |first=Gastone G. |date=2012-10-01 |title=Alcmaeon of Croton's Observations on Health, Brain, Mind, and Soul |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0964704X.2011.626265 |journal=Journal of the History of the Neurosciences |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=409–426 |doi=10.1080/0964704X.2011.626265 |issn=0964-704X |pmid=22947382|s2cid=45507924 }}</ref> Alcmaeon believed that the brain was the most important organ in the body and that it was responsible for controlling all of the body's functions. He also believed that the brain was the site of the senses and that different areas of the brain were responsible for detecting different sensory experiences.<ref name=":0" />

Alcmaeon's work also had a significant impact on the study of [[anatomy]]. He was one of the first physicians to perform [[dissection]]s on human [[cadaver]]s, which allowed him to gain a better understanding of the structure and function of the human body and all of its parts.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Heath |first=T. L. |date=1948 |title=Greek Mathematics and Science |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3609928 |journal=The Mathematical Gazette |volume=32 |issue=300 |pages=120–133 |doi=10.2307/3609928 |jstor=3609928 |issn=0025-5572|hdl=2027/uc1.31158004139753 |s2cid=250438858 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> Alcmaeon was particularly interested in the eyes and ears and made important discoveries about their structures and how they worked. He also recognized the importance of the [[heart]] in regards to the circulating of blood throughout the body, although his understanding of the [[circulatory system]] was not as advanced as that of later physicians.

Alcmaeon's ideas about the brain and the senses had a huge impact on the development of ancient Greek philosophy. His understanding of the brain as the area where intelligence and consciousness were created challenged the beliefs about the nature of the soul and the mind at the time.<ref name=":1" /> Alcmaeon's work laid the foundation for later philosophical and scientific debates about the relationship between the body and the mind, and his ideas continue to influence our thinking about these issues today.

Alcmaeon's work had an important impact on the development of Western medicine as well. His emphasis on [[observation]] and dissection helped to establish a scientific approach to medicine that highlighted the importance of empirical evidence and [[experimentation]]. Alcmaeon's work on the brain and the senses also helped to establish the importance of understanding the underlying physiological workings of diseases, which created a foundation for later advances in medical science.

Alcmaeon of Croton was a pioneer in the history of medicine and science. His work on the brain, the senses, and human anatomy allowed for later advances in these fields, and his emphasis on observation and experimentation helped to create a scientific approach to medicine that remains central to our understanding of the human body and mind today. Alcmaeon's ideas continue to influence our thinking about the  conscious, the relationship between the body and the mind, and the physiological mechanisms of diseases. His legacy as a scientist, philosopher, and physician continues to be seen today, almost 2,500 years after his death.
