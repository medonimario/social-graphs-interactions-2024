'''Adi Shankara''' (8th c. CE), also called '''Adi Shankaracharya''' ({{langx|sa|आदि शङ्कर, आदि शङ्कराचार्य|Ādi Śaṅkara, Ādi Śaṅkarācārya|lit=First [[Shankaracharya]]}},{{refn|group=note|''Adi'' means "first", to distinguish him from other Shankaras.}} {{IPA|sa|aːd̪i ɕɐŋkɐraːt͡ɕaːrjɐ|pron}}),{{refn|group=note|He is also known as Shankara Bhagavatpada ({{IAST|Śaṅkara Bhagavatpāda}}), Shankara Bhagavatpadacharya ({{IAST|Śaṅkara Bhagavatpādācārya}}) or [[Shankaracharya]], sometimes spelled Sankaracharya.}} was an Indian [[Vedanga|Vedic scholar]], [[Hindu philosophy|philosopher]] and teacher (''[[acharya]]'') of [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|Suthren Hirst|2005|p=1}} Reliable information on Shankara's actual life is scanty,{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=69–82}} and his true impact lies in his "iconic representation of Hindu religion and culture," despite the fact that most Hindus do not adhere to Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|King|2001|p=129-130}} Tradition also portrays him as the one who reconciled the various sects (Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Saktism) with the introduction of the {{IAST|[[panchayatana puja|Pañcāyatana]]}} form of [[Puja (Hinduism)|worship]], the simultaneous worship of five deities&nbsp;– Ganesha, Surya, Vishnu, Shiva and Devi, arguing that all deities were but different forms of the one [[Brahman]], the invisible Supreme Being.<ref name="Klaus Klostermaier 2007">Klaus Klostermaier (2007), A Survey of Hinduism, Third Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7082-4}}, p. 40</ref>

While often revered as the most important Indian philosopher, the historical influence of his works on Hindu intellectual thought has been questioned.{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|p=29}}{{sfn|King|2001|p=128}}{{sfn|Tola|1989}} Until the 10th century Shankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary [[Maṇḍana Miśra]],{{sfn|King|2001|p=128}}{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|pp=33–34}} and there is no mention of him in concurring Hindu, Buddhist or Jain sources until the 11th century.{{sfn|Clark|2006|p=217}} The popular image of Shankara started to take shape in the 14th century, centuries after his death, when Sringeri ''matha'' started to receive patronage from the kings of the Vijayanagara Empire{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|pp=33–34}}{{sfn|Hacker|1995|p=29–30}}{{sfn|Goodding|2013|p=89}}{{sfn|Blake Michael|1992|pp=60–62 with notes 6, 7 and 8}} and shifted their allegiance from ''Advaitic'' [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agamic]] Shaivism to Brahmanical Advaita orthodoxy.{{sfn|Clark|2006|p=215, 221-222}} Hagiographies dating from the 14th-17th centuries deified him as a [[Chakravarti (Sanskrit term)|ruler]]-[[Sannyasin|renunciate]], travelling on a [[digvijaya (conquest)|digvijaya]] (conquest of the four quarters){{sfn|Nowicka|2016|p=147}}{{sfn|Bader|2001|p=vii}} across the [[Indian subcontinent]] to propagate his philosophy, defeating his opponents in theological debates.{{sfn|Raju|1985|p=383}}{{sfn|Allen|2017}} These hagiographies portray him as founding four [[#Mathas|mathas]] ("monasteries"), and Adi Shankara also came to be regarded as the organiser of the [[Daśanāmi Sampradaya|Dashanami]] monastic order, and the unifier of the [[Shanmata]] tradition of worship. The title of [[Shankaracharya]], used by heads of certain monasteries in India, is derived from his name.

Due to his later fame, over 300 texts are attributed to him, including commentaries (''Bhāṣya''), introductory topical expositions (''Prakaraṇa grantha'') and poetry (''Stotra'').{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=6–7}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=2–3}} However, most of these are likely to be written by admirers or pretenders or scholars with an eponymous name.{{sfn|Hacker|1995|pp=30–31}}{{sfn|Halbfass|1983}} Works known to be written by Shankara himself are the ''Brahmasutrabhasya'',{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=6–7}} his commentaries on ten [[Mukhya Upanishads|principal Upanishads]],{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=6–7}}{{sfn|Hacker|1995|pp=30–31}} his commentary on the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'',{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|pp=xii–xiii}} and the ''[[Upadeśasāhasrī]]''.{{sfn|Halbfass|1990|pp=205–208}}{{sfn|Koller|2007|pp=98–106}} The authenticity of Shankara being the author of {{IAST|[[Viveka Chudamani|Vivekacūḍāmaṇi]]}} has been questioned and mostly rejected by scholarship.{{sfn|Grimes|2004}}{{sfn|Shah-Kazemi|2006|p=4}}

His authentic works present a harmonizing reading of the ''[[shastra]]s'', with liberating knowledge of the self at its core, synthesizing the [[Advaita Vedanta]] teachings of his time.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|pp=678-679}}<ref group=web name=Stanford_Dalal2021/> The central concern of Shankara's writings is the liberating knowledge of the true identity of ''jivatman'' (individual self) as ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]-[[Brahman]]'',{{sfn|Koller|2007|pp=98–106}}{{sfn|Nakamura|1999|p=176}} taking the Upanishads as an independent means of knowledge, beyond the ritually-oriented [[Mīmāṃsā]]-exegesis of the Vedas.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=163}}{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2000}}{{refn|group=note|name="ritualism"}}{{refn|group=note|name="Mookerji"}} Shankara's Advaita shows influences from [[Mahayana Buddhism]], despite Shankara's critiques;{{sfn|Shcherbatsky|1927|pp=44–45}}{{sfn|Dasgupta|1997|p=494}} and Hindu [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] opponents have even accused Shankara of being a "crypto-Buddhist,"{{sfn|Biderman|1978|pp=405–413}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=14}}{{sfn|King|1995|p=183}}{{refn|group=note|name="crypto-Buddhist"}} a qualification which is rejected by the Advaita Vedanta tradition, highlighting their respective views on ''Atman'', ''Anatta'' and ''Brahman''.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=60, 145–154}}{{refn|group=note|name=self_no-self}}

==Dating==
Several different dates have been proposed for Shankara.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=83–87}} While the Advaita-tradition assigns him to the 5th century BCE, the scholarly-accepted dating places Shankara to be a scholar from the first half of the 8th century CE.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=163}}{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=3–5}}

===Matha datings===
* 509–477 [[BCE]]: this dating is based on records of the heads of the Shankara's cardinal institutions {{IAST|Maṭha}}s. The exact dates of birth of Adi Shankaracharya believed by four monasteries are [[Dvārakā]] at 491 BCE,{{refn|group=note|Arun Kumar Upadhyay: "The copper-plate of King Sudhanwa, said to have been issued to Sankara and now in the possession of Government on behalf of Dwärká Mutt, bears the date as Yudhisthira Saka 2663, Åsvin Sukla 15. This gives us 476 B.C. as the relevant year of his death. The copper-plate seems to have been issued to Sankara right towards the end of his career.

The records of the [[Sringeri matha|Sringeri Matha]] state that Shankara was born in the 14th year of the reign of "Vikramaditya", but it is unclear to which king this name refers.<ref name="nila">K.A.

===Scholarly datings===
* 788–820 CE: This was proposed by late 19th and early twentieth century scholars, following K.P. Tiele,{{refn|group=note|Tiele based this dating on Yajnesvara Sastri's treatise ''Aryavidya-sudhakar'' ("The Moon of Noble Knowledge"), who in turn cited Bhatta Nilakantha's work ''Sankara-mandara-saurabha'' ("The fragrance of Sankara's paradise tree").{{sfnp|Isayeva|1993|p=83-84}}}} and was customarily accepted by scholars such as [[Max Müller]], Macdonnel, Pathok, Deussen and Radhakrishna.{{sfnp|Isayeva|1993|p=83-84}}{{sfnp|Tapasyananda|2015|p=20}} Though the 788–820 CE dates are widespread in 20th-century publications, recent scholarship has questioned the 788–820 CE dates.{{sfn|Mayeda|2015}}{{refn|group=note|The date 788–820 is also among those considered acceptable by [[Swami Tapasyananda (Ramakrishna Mission)|Swami Tapasyananda]], though he raises a number of questions.{{sfnp|Tapasyananda|2015|p=15-17}}}}
* {{Circa|700|750}} CE: Late 20th-century and early 21st-century scholarship tends to place Shankara's life in the first half of the 8th century.{{sfn|Mayeda|2015}}{{sfnp|Isaeva|1993|p=84–87 with footnotes}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvnb|Koller|2013|p=99}}: "the best recent scholarship argues that he was born in 700 and died in 750 CE."}} This estimate is based on the probable earliest and latest limits for his lifetime. His works contains traces of debates with Buddhist and [[Mimamsa]] authors from th 5th-7th century, setting the earliest limit at {{Circa|650 CE}}. The latest limit is established by [[Vāchaspati Misra|Vacaspatimisra]]'s commentary on Sankara's work, dated first half of the 9th century, thus setting the latest limit for Sankara at {{Circa|800 CE}}.{{sfnp|Isayeva|1993|p=85}}

===Other datings===
* 44–12 [[BCE]]: the commentator Anandagiri believed he was born at Chidambaram in 44 BCE and died in 12 BCE.{{sfn|Keshava Menon|1976|p=108}}
* 6th century CE: Telang placed him in this century. Sir R.G. Bhandarkar believed he was born in 680 CE.{{sfn|Keshava Menon|1976|p=108}}
* 805–897 CE: Venkiteswara not only places Shankara later than most, but also had the opinion that it would not have been possible for him to have achieved all the works apportioned to him, and has him live ninety-two years.{{sfn|Keshava Menon|1976|p=108}}

===Traditional views of Shankara===
Shankara has an unparallelled status in the tradition of [[Advaita Vedanta]]. Hagiographies from the 14th-17th century portray him as a victor who travelled all over India to help restore the study of the Vedas<ref>Per Durst-Andersen and Elsebeth F. Lange (2010), Mentality and Thought: North, South, East and West, CBS Press, {{ISBN|978-87-630-0231-8}}, p. 68</ref> According to Frank Whaling, "Hindus of the Advaita persuasion (and others too) have seen in Sankara the one who restored the Hindu ''dharma'' against the attacks of the Buddhists (and Jains) and in the process helped to drive Buddhism out of India."<ref name="Whaling_1979">Frank Whaling (1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23440361 ''Sankara and Buddhism''], Journal of Indian Philosophy Vol. 7, No. 1 (MARCH 1979), pp. 1-42: "Hindus of the Advaita persuasion (and others too) have seen in Sankara the one who restored the Hindu ''dharma'' against the attacks of the Buddhists (and Jains) and in the process helped to drive Buddhism out of India."</ref> His teachings and [[sampradaya|tradition]] are central to [[Smartism]] and have influenced [[Sant Mat]] lineages.<ref>{{cite conference|author=Ron Geaves|date=March 2002|title=From Totapuri to Maharaji: Reflections on a Lineage (Parampara)|conference=27th Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions, Oxford}}</ref> Tradition portrays him as the one who reconciled the various sects (Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Saktism) with the introduction of the {{IAST|[[panchayatana puja|Pañcāyatana]]}} form of [[Puja (Hinduism)|worship]], the simultaneous worship of five deities&nbsp;– Ganesha, Surya, Vishnu, Shiva and Devi, arguing that all deities were but different forms of the one [[Brahman]], the invisible Supreme Being,<ref name="Klaus Klostermaier 2007"/> implying that Advaita Vedanta stood above all other traditions.{{sfn|Kruijf|Sahoo|2014|p=105}}

===Prominence of Maṇḍana Miśra (until 10th century)===
Scholars have questioned Shankara's early influence in India.{{sfn|Hacker|1995|p=29–30}} The Buddhist scholar [[Richard E. King]] states,
{{blockquote|Although it is common to find Western scholars and Hindus arguing that Sankaracarya was the most influential and important figure in the history of Hindu intellectual thought, this does not seem to be justified by the historical evidence.{{sfn|King|2001|p=128}}}}

According to Clark, "Sankara was relatively unknown during his life-time, and probably for several centuries after, as there is no mention of him in Buddhist or jain sources for centuries; nor is he mentioned by other important philosophers of the ninth and tenth centuries."{{sfn|Clark|2006|p=217}} According to King and Roodurmun, until the 10th century Shankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary [[Maṇḍana Miśra|Mandana-Misra]], the latter considered to be the major representative of Advaita.{{sfn|King|2001|p=128}}{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|pp=33–34}} [[Maṇḍana Miśra]], an older contemporary of Shankara,{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|p=29}} was a Mimamsa scholar and a follower of [[Kumarila]], but also wrote a seminal text on Advaita that has survived into the modern era, the ''Brahma-siddhi''.{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|p=31}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Allen Wright Thrasher|year=1993|title=The Advaita Vedānta of Brahma-siddhi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9b2cJ1gLgvgC |publisher =Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0982-6 |pages=vii–x}}</ref> The "theory of error" set forth in the ''Brahma-siddhi'' became the normative Advaita Vedanta theory of error,{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|p=32}} and for a couple of centuries he was the most influential Vedantin.{{sfn|King|2002|p=128}}{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|pp=33-34}}{{refn|group=note|name=King2002_MandanaMisra}} His student [[Vachaspati Miśra]], who is believed to have been an incarnation of Shankara to popularize the Advaita view,{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|p=34}} wrote the ''[[Bhamati]]'', a commentary on Shankara's ''Brahma Sutra Bhashya'', and the ''Brahmatattva-samiksa'', a commentary on Mandana Mishra's ''Brahma-siddhi''. His thought was mainly inspired by Mandana Miśra, and harmonises Shankara's thought with that of Mandana Miśra.{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|p=35}}<ref group=web name=BhamatiVivarana>[http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/bhavir.html The Bhamati and Vivarana Schools]</ref> The Bhamati school takes an ontological approach. It sees the [[Jiva]] as the source of avidya.<ref group=web name=BhamatiVivarana /> It sees yogic practice and contemplation as the main factor in the acquirement of liberation, while the study of the Vedas and reflection are additional factors.{{sfn|King|1999|p=56}}{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|p=37}} The later Advaita Vedanta tradition incorporated Maṇḍana Miśra into the Shankara-fold, by identifying him with [[Sureśvara]] (9th century),<ref name=karlpottermms>{{harvnb|Potter|2008|pp=346–347, 420–423}}: "There is little firm historical information about Suresvara; tradition holds Suresvara is same as Mandana Misra".</ref> believing that Maṇḍana Miśra became a disciple of Shankara after a public debate which Shankara won.{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|p=31}}{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=290–291}}

According to [[Satchidanandendra Sarasvati]], "almost all the later Advaitins were influenced by Mandana Misra and [[Bhāskara (Bhedabheda Vedanta)|Bhaskara]]."{{sfn|Satchidanandendra Sarasvati|1997|p=6}} He argues that most of post-Shankara Advaita Vedanta actually deviates from Shankara, and that only his student Suresvara, who's had little influence, represents Shankara correctly.{{sfn|Potter|2006|pp=6–7}} In this view, Shankara's influential student Padmapada misunderstood Shankara, while his views were manitained by the Suresvara school.{{sfn|Potter|2006|pp=6–7}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Potter|2006|pp=6–7}}: "...these modern interpreters are implying that most Advaitins after Samkara's time are confused and basically mistaken, and that 99% of the extant classical interpretive literature on Samkara's philosophy is off the mark. This is clearly a remarkably radical conclusion. Yet, there is good reason to think that it may well be true.}}

===Vaishnavite Vedanta (10th-14th century)===
[[Hajime Nakamura]] states that prior to Shankara, views similar to his already existed, but did not occupy a dominant position within the Vedanta.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=690}} Until the 11th century, Vedanta itself was a peripheral school of thought;{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=157; 229 note 57}} Vedanta became a major influence when it was utilized by various sects of Hinduism to ground their doctrines.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=691-693}} The early Vedanta scholars were from the upper classes of society, well-educated in traditional culture. They formed a social elite, "sharply distinguished from the general practitioners and theologians of Hinduism."{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=693}} Their teachings were "transmitted among a small number of selected intellectuals".{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=693}} Works of the early Vedanta schools do not contain references to Vishnu or Shiva.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=692}} It was only after Shankara that "the theologians of the various sects of Hinduism utilized Vedanta philosophy to a greater or lesser degree to form the basis of their doctrines,"{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=691}} whereby "its theoretical influence upon the whole of Indian society became final and definitive."{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=693}} Examples are [[Ramanuja]] (11th c.), who aligned [[bhakti]], "the major force in the religions of Hinduism," with philosophical thought, meanwhile rejecting Shankara's views,<ref group=web name=EB_Ramanuja>Encyclopædia Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ramanuja Ramanajua]</ref> and the [[Nath]]-tradition.{{sfn|Feuerstein|1978}}

===Vijayanagara Empire and Vidyaranya (14th century) - creation of traditional (hagiographic) views===
In medieval times, Advaita Vedanta position as most influential Hindu ''darsana'' started to take shape, as Advaitins in the Vijayanagara Empire competed for patronage from the royal court, and tried to convert others to their sect.{{sfn|Stoker|2016|p=55-56}} It is only during this period that the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Vedanta was established.{{sfn|Hacker|1995|p=29–30}}{{sfn|Blake Michael|1992|pp=60–62 with notes 6, 7 and 8}}{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=178–183}} Many of Shankara's biographies were created and published in and after the 14th century, such as Vidyaranya's widely cited ''Śankara-vijaya''.

===Hagiographies: ''Digvijaya'' - "The conquests of Shankara" (14th-17th century)===
[[File:Kaladi shankarabirthplace.jpg|thumb|The birthplace of Adi Shankara at [[Kalady]]]][[File:Adi shankara.jpg|thumb|upright|Murti of Shankara at his [[Samādhi|Samadhi]] Mandir, behind [[Kedarnath Temple]], in [[Kedarnath]], India]]Reliable information on Shankara's actual life is scanty.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=69–82}} His existing biographies are not historical accurate documents, but politically motivated hagiographies which were all written several centuries after his time and abound in legends and improbable events.{{sfn|Mayeda|2015}}

====Sources====
{{Main|Digvijaya (conquest)|l1 = Digvijaya}}

There are at least fourteen different known [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] of Adi Shankara's life.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=3–5}} These, as well as other hagiographical works on Shankara, were written many centuries to a thousand years after Shankara's death,{{sfn|Pande|2011|p=35}} in Sanskrit and non-Sanskrit languages, and the hagiographies are filled with legends and fiction, often mutually contradictory.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=3–5}}{{refn|group=note|The hagiographies of Shankara mirror the pattern of synthesizing facts, fiction and legends as with other ancient and medieval era Indian scholars. Some hagiographic poems depict Shankara as a reincarnation of deity [[Shiva]], much like other Indian scholars are revered as reincarnation of other deities; for example, Mandana-misra is depicted as an embodiment of deity [[Brahma]], Citsukha of deity [[Varuna]], Anandagiri of [[Agni]], among others. See {{harvtxt|Isaeva|1993|pp=69–72}}.}}

Many of these are called the ''Śankara Vijaya'' ('The conquests (''[[Digvijaya (conquest)|digvijaya]]'') of Shankara'), while some are called ''Guruvijaya'', ''Sankarabhyudaya'' and ''Shankaracaryacarita''. Of these, the ''Brhat-Sankara-Vijaya'' by Citsukha is the oldest hagiography but only available in excerpts, while ''Sankaradigvijaya'' by Mādhava (17th c.) and ''Sankaravijaya'' by Anandagiri are the most cited.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=3–5}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=69–82}} Other significant hagiographies are the ''{{IAST|Cidvilāsīya Śaṅkara Vijayaṃ}}'' (of Cidvilāsa, c. between the 15th and 17th centuries), and the ''{{IAST|Keraļīya Śaṅkara Vijayaṃ}}'' (of the Kerala region, extant from c. the 17th century).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/sankara-vijayam.html |title= The ''Sankaravijaya'' literature |access-date=2006-08-23 |author=Vidyasankar, S.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Tapasyananda |first=Swami |year=2002|title= Sankara-Dig-Vijaya |page=viii |no-pp=true}}</ref>}

Scholars note that one of the most cited Shankara hagiographies, Anandagiri's, includes stories and legends about historically different people, but all bearing the same name of Sri Shankaracarya or also referred to as Shankara but likely meaning more ancient scholars with names such as Vidya-sankara, Sankara-misra and Sankara-nanda.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=69–82}} Some hagiographies are probably written by those who sought to create a historical basis for their rituals or theories.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=69–82}}{{sfn|Pande|2011|p=35}}

====Early life====
According to the oldest hagiographies, Shankara was born in the southern Indian state of [[Kerala]], in a village named [[Kaladi]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Students' Britannica India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISFBJarYX7YC&pg=PA379|year=2000|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-0-85229-760-5|pages=379–}}</ref>{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=3–5}} sometimes spelled as Kalati or Karati.<ref>{{cite book|author=Narasingha Prosad Sil |title=Swami Vivekananda: A Reassessment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTDPlJPyV_MC |year=1997|publisher=Susquehanna University Press |isbn=978-0-945636-97-7 |page=192 }}</ref>{{refn|group=note|This may be  present day [[Kalady]] in central Kerala. The house he was born in is still maintained as [[Melpazhur Mana]].}}  His parents were an aged, childless, couple who led a devout life of service to the poor. They named their child Shankara, meaning "giver of prosperity".<ref>{{Cite book|title=East Meets West|last=Adago|first=John|publisher=Program Publishing; 2 edition|year=2018|isbn=978-0692124215|location=UK}}</ref> His father died while Shankara was very young.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=3–5}} Shankara's {{IAST|[[upanayanam]]}}, the initiation into student-life, had to be delayed due to the death of his father, and was then performed by his mother.<ref>{{cite book |first=Y. Keshava |last=Menon |year=1976 |title=The Mind of Adi Shankara |publisher=Jaico |page=109 |isbn=978-8172242145}}</ref>

====Sannyasa====
Shankara's hagiographies describe him as someone who was attracted to the life of [[Sannyasa]] (hermit) from early childhood. His mother disapproved. A story, found in all hagiographies, describe Shankara at age eight going to a river with his mother, ''Sivataraka'', to bathe, and where he is caught by a crocodile.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=74–75}} Shankara called out to his mother to give him permission to become a ''Sannyasin'' or else the crocodile will kill him. The mother agrees, Shankara is freed and leaves his home for education. He reaches a Saivite sanctuary along a river in a north-central state of India, and becomes the disciple of a teacher named [[Govinda Bhagavatpada]].{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=74–75}}{{sfn|Pande|2011|pp=31–32, also 6–7, 67–68}} The stories in various hagiographies diverge in details about the first meeting between Shankara and his ''Guru'', where they met, as well as what happened later.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=74–75}} Several texts suggest Shankara schooling with Govindapada happened along the river [[Narmada]] in [[Omkareshwar]], a few place it along river Ganges in Kashi ([[Varanasi]]) as well as Badari ([[Badrinath]] in the Himalayas).{{sfn|Pande|2011|pp=31–32, also 6–7, 67–68}}

The hagiographies vary in their description of where he went, who he met and debated and many other details of his life. Most mention Shankara studying the [[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]] and [[Brahmasutra]] with Govindapada, and Shankara authoring several key works in his youth, while he was studying with his teacher.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=76–77}} It is with his teacher Govinda, that Shankara studied Gaudapadiya Karika, as Govinda was himself taught by Gaudapada.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=3–5}} Most also mention a meeting with scholars of the [[Mimamsa]] school of Hinduism namely Kumarila and Prabhakara, as well as Mandana and various Buddhists, in ''[[Shastrartha]]'' (an Indian tradition of public philosophical debates attended by large number of people, sometimes with royalty).{{sfn|Pande|2011|pp=31–32, also 6–7, 67–68}}

====Travels (''Digvijaya'') and disciples====
Thereafter, the hagiographies about Shankara vary significantly. Different and widely inconsistent accounts of his life include diverse journeys, pilgrimages, public debates, installation of yantras and lingas, as well as the founding of monastic centers in north, east, west and south India.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=69–82}}{{sfn|Pande|2011|pp=31–32, also 6–7, 67–68}}

While the details and chronology vary, most hagiographies present Shankara as traveling widely within India, Gujarat to Bengal, and participating in public philosophical debates with different orthodox schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], as well as heterodox traditions such as Buddhists, Jains, Arhatas, Saugatas, and [[Charvaka]]s.{{sfn|Pande|2011|pp=5–36}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hovey|first=Sally Wriggins|title=Xuanzang: A Buddhist Pilgrim on the Silk Road. Westview Press, 1998.}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2021}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pandey|first=Vraj Kumar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDXsAAAAIAAJ&q=adi+shankara+buddhist+monk+debate|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Philosophy|date=2007|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=978-81-261-3112-9|language=en}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2021}} The hagiographies credit him with starting several ''Matha'' (monasteries), but this is uncertain.{{sfn|Pande|2011|pp=5–36}} Ten monastic orders in different parts of India are generally attributed to Shankara's travel-inspired ''Sannyasin'' schools, each with Advaita notions, of which four have continued in his tradition: Bharati (Sringeri), Sarasvati (Kanchi), Tirtha and Asramin (Dvaraka).{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=82–91}} Other monasteries that record Shankara's visit include Giri, Puri, Vana, Aranya, Parvata and Sagara – all names traceable to [[Ashrama (stage)|Ashrama]] system in Hinduism and Vedic literature.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=82–91}}

Shankara had a number of disciple scholars during his travels, including [[Padmapadacharya]] (also called Sanandana, associated with the text ''Atma-bodha''), [[Sureśvara]]charya, [[Totakacharya]], [[Hastamalakacharya]], Chitsukha, Prthividhara, Chidvilasayati, Bodhendra, Brahmendra, Sadananda and others, who authored their own literature on Shankara and Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Pande|2011|pp=5–36}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=71–82, 93–94}}

====Death====
According to hagiographies, supported by four maths, Adi Shankara died at [[Kedarnath]] in the northern Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]], a Hindu pilgrimage site in the Himalayas.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=90-91}}{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=6–7}} Texts say that he was last seen by his disciples behind the Kedarnath temple, walking in the Himalayas until he was not traced. Some texts locate his death in alternate locations such as [[Kanchipuram]] (Tamil Nadu) and somewhere in the state of Kerala.{{sfn|Pande|2011|pp=31–32, also 6–7, 67–68}} According to the hagiographies related to the monastery of Kanchi, Adi Sankara died at Kanchi.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=90}}

===Hagiographies: attribution of Mathas and Smarta tradition (14-17th century)===
{{See also|Dashanami Sampradaya}}Traditionally, Shankara is regarded as the founder of the {{IAST|[[Dashanami Sampradaya|Daśanāmi Sampradāya]]}} of [[Hindu]] [[monasticism]], and the ''[[Panchayatana puja]]'' and [[Shanmata|{{IAST|Ṣaṇmata}}]] of the [[Smarta tradition]].

====Dashanami Sampradaya and mathas====
Advaita Vedanta is, at least in the west, primarily known as a philosophical system. But it is also a tradition of [[Sannyasa|renunciation]]. Philosophy and renunciation are closely related:<ref group="web" name="MonasticTradition" />
{{blockquote|Most of the notable authors in the advaita tradition were members of the sannyasa tradition, and both sides of the tradition share the same values, attitudes and metaphysics.<ref group=web name="MonasticTradition" />}}

Shankara was a Vaishnavite who came to be presented as an incarnation of [[Shiva]] in the 14th century,{{sfn|Clark|2006|p=218, 220, 224}}<ref group="web" name="MonasticTradition" /> to facilitate the adoption of his teachings by previously Saiva-oriented ''mathas'' in the Vijayanagara Empire. From the 14th century onwards hagiographies were composed, in which he is portrayed as establishing the [[Daśanāmi Sampradaya]],{{sfn|Clark|2006|p=224-225}} organizing a section of the [[Dashanami Sampradaya|Ekadandi monks]] under an umbrella grouping of ten names.<ref group="web" name="MonasticTradition">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Shankara/shankar4.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508091224/http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Shankara/shankar4.html|url-status=dead|title=Sankara Acarya Biography – Monastic Tradition|archive-date=8 May 2012}}</ref> Several other Hindu monastic and Ekadandi traditions remained outside the organisation of the Dasanāmis.<ref>Karigoudar Ishwaran, ''Ascetic Culture''</ref><ref>Wendy Sinclair-Brull, ''Female Ascetics''</ref>

According to tradition, Adi Sankara organised the Hindu monks of these ten sects or names under four {{IAST|[[Matha|Maṭhas]]}} (Sanskrit: {{lang|sa|मठ}}) (monasteries), with the headquarters at [[Dvārakā]] in the West, [[Jagannatha Puri]] in the East, [[Sringeri]] in the South and [[Badrikashrama]] in the North.<ref group="web" name="MonasticTradition" /> Each ''matha'' was headed by one of his four main disciples, who each continues the Vedanta Sampradaya.

According to Paul Hacker, the system may have been initiated by [[Vidyaranya]] (14th c.), who may have founded a ''matha'', proclaiming that it was established by Shankara himself, as part of his campaign to propagate Shankara's Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Hacker|1995|p=29}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|1998|p=177}} Vidyaranya enjoyed royal support,<ref name="talbot" /> and his sponsorship and methodical efforts helped establish Shankara as a rallying symbol of values, spread historical and cultural influence of Shankara's Vedānta philosophies, and establish monasteries (''mathas'') to expand the cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Vedānta.{{sfn|Hacker|1995|p=29–30}}

====Smarta Tradition====
{{Main|Smarta Tradition}}

Traditionally, Shankara is regarded as the greatest teacher{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=1017}}{{sfn|Popular Prakashan|2000|p=52}} and reformer of the [[Smarta Tradition|Smartism]] [[sampradaya]], which is one of four major ''sampradaya'' of [[Hinduism]].{{sfn|Rosen|2006|p=166}}{{sfn|Popular Prakashan|2000|p=52}} According to [[Alf Hiltebeitel]], Shankara established the nondualist interpretation of the Upanishads as the touchstone of a revived ''smarta'' tradition:
{{blockquote|Practically, Shankara fostered a rapprochement between Advaita and ''smarta'' orthodoxy, which by his time had not only continued to defend the ''varnasramadharma'' theory as defining the path of ''karman'', but had developed the practice of ''pancayatanapuja'' ("five-shrine worship") as a solution to varied and conflicting devotional practices. Thus one could worship any one of five deities (Vishnu, Siva, Durga, Surya, Ganesa) as one's ''istadevata'' ("deity of choice").{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002|p=29}}}}

===Neo-Vedanta (19-20th century)===
Shankara's position was further established in the 19th and 20th-century, when [[Neo-Vedanta|neo-Vedantins]] and western [[Orientalism|Orientalists]] elevated Advaita Vedanta "as the connecting theological thread that united Hinduism into a single religious tradition."{{sfn|King|2001|p=129}} Shankara became "an iconic representation of Hindu religion and culture," despite the fact that most Hindus do not adhere to Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|King|2001|p=129-130}}

==Works==
{{Further|Adi Shankara bibliography}}

Adi Shankara is highly esteemed in contemporary Advaita Vedanta, and over 300 texts are attributed to his name, including commentaries (''Bhāṣya''), original philosophical expositions (''Prakaraṇa grantha'') and poetry (''Stotra'').{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=6–7}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=2–3}} However, most of these are not authentic works of Shankara, and are likely to be written by his admirers, or scholars whose name was also Shankaracharya.{{sfn|Hacker|1995|pp=30–31}}{{sfn|Halbfass|1983}} Piantelli has published a complete list of works attributed to Adi Sankara, along with issues of authenticity for most.<ref>M Piantelly, Sankara e la Renascita del Brahmanesimo, Indian Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Apr. 1977), pp. 429–435</ref>

===Authentic works===
Shankara is most known for his systematic reviews and commentaries (''Bhasyas'') on ancient Indian texts. Shankara's masterpiece of commentary is the ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' (literally, commentary on [[Brahma Sutra]]s). The Brahma Sutras are a fundamental text of the [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=6–7}}

Shankara's stotras considered authentic include those dedicated to Krishna ([[Vaishnavism]]) and one to Shiva ([[Shaivism]]) – often considered two different sects within Hinduism.

===Works of doubtful authenticity or not authentic===
Commentaries on Nrisimha-Purvatatapaniya and Shveshvatara Upanishads are attributed to Shankara, but their authenticity is highly doubtful.{{sfn|Hacker|1995|pp=30–31}}{{sfn|Pande|2011|pp=105–113}}<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/sankara.html| title = Sankaracarya| author = Vidyasankar, S|access-date=2006-07-24| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060616123125/http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/sankara.html| archive-date= 16 June 2006| url-status= live}}</ref> Similarly, commentaries on several early and later Upanishads attributed to Shankara are rejected by scholars<ref name=paulhackeraupr/> to be his works, and are likely works of later scholars; these include: Kaushitaki Upanishad, Maitri Upanishad, Kaivalya Upanishad, Paramahamsa Upanishad, Sakatayana Upanishad, Mandala Brahmana Upanishad, Maha Narayana Upanishad, Gopalatapaniya Upanishad. However, in Brahmasutra-Bhasya, Shankara cites some of these Upanishads as he develops his arguments, but the historical notes left by his companions and disciples, along with major differences in style and the content of the commentaries on later Upanishad have led scholars to conclude that the commentaries on later Upanishads were not Shankara's work.{{sfn|Pande|2011|pp=105–113}}

The authenticity of Shankara being the author of {{IAST|[[Viveka Chudamani|Vivekacūḍāmaṇi]]}}<ref>Adi Shankaracharya, [https://archive.org/stream/vivekachudamanio00sankrich#page/n3/mode/2up Vivekacūḍāmaṇi] S Madhavananda (Translator), Advaita Ashrama (1921)</ref> has been questioned,{{sfn|Grimes|2004}}{{sfn|Shah-Kazemi|2006|p=4}} though it is "so closely interwoven into the spiritual heritage of Shankara that any analysis of his perspective which fails to consider [this work] would be incomplete."{{sfn|Shah-Kazemi|2006|p=4}}{{refn|group=note|See also IndiaDivine.org, [http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/advaita-vedanta/142896-authorship-vivekachudamani.html ''Authorship of Vivekachudamani''] and arshabodha.org, [http://www.arshabodha.org/adiShankara/Vivekachudamani_eBook.pdf ''Sri Sankara's Vivekachudamani''], pp. 3–4, ''The Question of Authorship of Vivekachudamani''}} According to Grimes, "modern scholars tend to reject its authenticity as a work by Shankara," while "traditionalists tend to accept it."{{sfn|Grimes|2004|p=23}} Nevertheless, does Grimes argue that "there is still a likelihood that Śaṅkara is the author of the Vivekacūḍāmaṇi," {{sfn|Grimes|2004|p=23}} noting that "it differs in certain respects from his other works in that it addresses itself to a different audience and has a different emphasis and purpose."{{sfn|Grimes|2004|p=13}}[[File:Vidyashankara Temple at Shringeri.jpg|thumb|Vidyashankara temple at [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham]], [[Shringeri]]]]

The ''[[Aparokshanubhuti]]'' and ''[[Atma bodha]]'' are also attributed to Shankara, as his original philosophical treatises, but this is doubtful. Paul Hacker has also expressed some reservations that the compendium ''[[Sarva-siddhanta Sangraha|Sarva-darsana-siddhanta Sangraha]]'' was completely authored by Shankara, because of difference in style and thematic inconsistencies in parts.<ref name=paulhackeraupr>{{harvnb|Hacker|1995|loc="Sankaracarya and Sankarabhagavatpada: Preliminary Remarks Concerning the Authorship Problem"|pp=41–56}}</ref> Similarly, ''Gayatri-bhasya'' is doubtful to be Shankara's work.{{sfn|Pande|2011|pp=105–113}} Other commentaries that are highly unlikely to be Shankara's work include those on ''Uttaragita'', ''Siva-gita'', ''Brahma-gita'', ''Lalita-shasranama'', ''Suta-samhita'' and ''Sandhya-bhasya''. The commentary on the Tantric work ''Lalita-trisati-bhasya'' attributed to Shankara is also unauthentic.{{sfn|Pande|2011|pp=105–113}}

Shankara is widely credited with commentaries on other scriptural works, such as the [[Vishnu sahasranama|Vishnu sahasranāma]] and the [[Sanatsujatiya|Sānatsujātiya]],<ref name=vanb78>Johannes Buitenen (1978).

According to Koller, Shankara, and his contemporaries, made a significant contribution in understanding Buddhism and the ancient Vedic traditions, then transforming the extant ideas, particularly reforming the Vedanta tradition of Hinduism, making it India's most important "spiritual tradition" for more than a thousand years.{{sfn|Koller|2012|p=99}}{{refn|group=note|This includes also the dualistic Vaishna bhakti traditions, which have also commented on the Upanishads and the Brahma Sutras, but take a different stance.}} Benedict Ashley credits Adi Shankara for unifying two seemingly disparate philosophical doctrines in Hinduism, namely [[Jivatma|Atman]] and [[Brahman]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Benedict Ashley, O.P.|title=The Way toward Wisdom|year=2006|isbn=978-0-268-02028-6|oclc=609421317|page=395|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |author-link=Benedict Ashley}}</ref>

According to Nakamura, Shankara was not an original thinker, but systematised the works of preceding philosophers.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=680}} The central theme of Shankara's writings is the liberating knowledge of the identity of the Self ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]) and ''[[Brahman]]''.{{sfn|Koller|2007|pp=98–106}}{{sfn|Nakamura|1999|p=176}} [[Moksha]] is [[Jivanmukti|attained in this life]] by recognizing the identity of ''Atman'' and ''Brahman'',{{sfn|Koller|2007|pp=98–106}} as mediated by the ''[[Mahāvākyas|Mahavakyas]]'', especially ''Tat Tvam Asi'', "That you are."

===Historical context===
{{further|History of India|History of Hinduism}}

Shankara lived in the time of the great "Late classical Hinduism",{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41–43}} which lasted from 650 till 1100 CE.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41–43}} This era was one of political instability that followed the [[Gupta dynasty]] and [[King Harsha]] of the 7th century CE.{{sfn|Koller|2012|p=99–108}} power became decentralised in India. Several larger kingdoms emerged, with "countless vasal states".{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Michaels|2004|p=41}}:
* In the east the [[Pala Empire]] (770–1125 CE),
* in the west and north the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] (7th–10th century),
* in the southwest the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]] (752–973),
* in the Dekkhan the [[Chalukya dynasty]] (7th–8th century),
* and in the south the [[Pallava dynasty]] (7th–9th century) and the [[Chola dynasty]] (9th century).}} The kingdoms were ruled via a feudal system. Smaller kingdoms were dependent on the protection of the larger kingdoms. "The great king was remote, was exalted and deified",{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}} as reflected in the [[Tantra|Tantric]] [[Mandala]], which could also depict the king as the centre of the mandala.{{sfn|White|2000|pp=25–28}}

The disintegration of central power also lead to regionalisation of religiosity, and religious rivalry.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|McRae|2003}}: This resembles the development of [[Chinese Chán]] during the [[Chinese Chán#An Lu-shan rebellion|An Lu-shan rebellion]] and the [[Chinese Chán#Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907–960/979)|Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907–960/979)]], during which power became decentralised end new Chán-schools emerged.}} Local cults and languages were enhanced, and the influence of "Brahmanic ritualistic Hinduism"{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} was diminished.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} Rural and devotional movements arose, along with [[Shaivism]], [[Vaisnavism]], [[Bhakti]] and [[Tantra]],{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} though "sectarian groupings were only at the beginning of their development".{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} Religious movements had to compete for recognition by the local lords,{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} and [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Islam]] and various traditions within Hinduism were competing for members.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Doniger |first=Wendy |title=On Hinduism |date=March 2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199360079 |location=Oxford |oclc=858660095}}</ref><ref>TMP Mahadevan (1968), Shankaracharya, National Book Trust, pp. 283–285, {{oclc|254278306}}</ref><ref name=frankwhaling>Frank Whaling (1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23440361 Śankara and Buddhism], Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 1–42</ref> Buddhism in particular had emerged as a powerful influence in India's spiritual traditions in the first 700 years of the 1st millennium CE,{{sfn|Koller|2012|p=99–108}}{{sfn|Potter|2008|pp=1–21, 103–119}} but lost its position after the 8th century, and began to disappear in India.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} This was reflected in the change of puja-ceremonies at the courts in the 8th century, where Hindu gods replaced the Buddha as the "supreme, imperial deity".{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Inden|1998|p=67}}: "Before the eighth century, the Buddha was accorded the position of universal deity and ceremonies by which a king attained to imperial status were elaborate donative ceremonies entailing gifts to Buddhist monks and the installation of a symbolic Buddha in a stupa ... This pattern changed in the eighth century. The Buddha was replaced as the supreme, imperial deity by one of the Hindu gods (except under the Palas of eastern India, the Buddha's homeland) ... Previously the Buddha had been accorded imperial-style worship (puja). Now as one of the Hindu gods replaced the Buddha at the imperial centre and pinnacle of the cosmo-political system, the image or symbol of the Hindu god comes to be housed in a monumental temple and given increasingly elaborate imperial-style puja worship."}}

===Systematizer of Advaita===
According to Nakamura, comparison of the known teachings of the early Vedantins and Shankara's thought shows that most of the characteristics of Shankara's thought "were advocated by someone before Śankara".{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=678}} Shankara "was the person who synthesized the ''Advaita-vāda'' which had previously existed before him".{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=678}} According to Nakamura, after the growing influence of Buddhism on Vedānta, culminating in the works of Gauḍapāda, Adi Shankara gave a Vedantic character to the Buddhistic elements in these works,{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=13}} synthesising and rejuvenating the doctrine of Advaita.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=679}}

According to Koller, using ideas in ancient Indian texts, Shankara systematized the foundation for Advaita [[Vedanta|Vedānta]] in the 8th century, reforming [[Badarayana]]'s Vedānta tradition.{{sfn|Koller|2007|pp=98–106}} According to Mayeda, Shankara represents a turning point in the development of Vedānta,{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=13}} yet he also notices that it is only since Deussens's praise that Shankara "has usually been regarded as the greatest philosopher of India."{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=XV}} Mayeda further notes that Shankara was primarily concerned with ''moksha'', "and not with the establishment of a complete system of philosophy or theology,"{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=XV}} following Potter, who qualifies Shankara as a "speculative philosopher."{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=XVIII, note 3}} Lipner notes that Shankara's "main literary approach was commentarial and hence perforce disjointed rather than procedurally systematic [...] though a systematic philosophy can be derived from Samkara's thought."{{sfn|Lipner|2000|p=56, incl. note 12}}

Shankara has been described as influenced by Shaivism and Shaktism, but his works and philosophy suggest greater overlap with Vaishnavism, influence of [[Raja yoga|Yoga]] school of Hinduism, but most distinctly express his Advaitin convictions with a monistic view of spirituality,{{sfn|Koller|2007|pp=98–106}}{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=3–5}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=3, 29–30}} and his commentaries mark a turn from realism to idealism.{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=64}}{{sfn|Scheepers|2000|p=123}}

===''Moksha'' - liberating knowledge of Brahman===
The central theme of Shankara's writings is the liberating knowledge of the true identity of ''jivatman'' (individual self) as ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Ātman]])-[[Brahman]]''.{{sfn|Koller|2007|pp=98–106}}{{sfn|Nakamura|1999|p=176}}{{refn|group=note|Brahman is not to be confused with the personalised godhead [[Brahma]].}} One of Shankara's main concerns was establishing the Upanishads as an independent means of knowledge beyond the ritually-oriented [[Mīmāṃsā]] exegesis of the vedas.{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2000}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=163}}{{refn|group=note|name="ritualism"}}{{refn|group=note|name="Mookerji"}}

According to Shankara, the one unchanging entity (Brahman) alone is real, while changing entities do not have absolute existence. Shankara's primary objective was to explain how [[moksha]] is [[Moksha#Mokṣha in this life|attained in this life]] by recognizing the true identity of ''jivatman'' as ''Atman-Brahman'',{{sfn|Koller|2007|pp=98–106}} as mediated by the ''[[Mahāvākyas]]'', especially ''Tat Tvam Asi'', "That you are." Correct knowledge of ''jivatman'' and ''Atman-Brahman'' is the attainment of ''Brahman'', immortality,{{sfn|Rambachan|2006|p=26}} and leads to ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation) from suffering{{refn|group=note|The suffering created by the workings of the mind entangled with physical reality}} and ''samsara'', the cycle of rebirth.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}} This is stated by Shankara as follows:
{{blockquote|
<poem>
I am other than name, form and action.
My nature is ever free!
I am Self, the supreme unconditioned Brahman.
I am pure Awareness, always non-dual.
</poem>
|Adi Shankara, [[Upadesasahasri]] 11.7|{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}}}

===''Pramanas'' - means of knowledge===
Shankara recognized the means of knowledge,{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=46}}{{refn|group=note|Mayeda refers to statements from Shankara regarding epistemology (''pramana-janya'') in section 1.18.133 of Upadesasahasri, and section 1.1.4 of Brahmasutra-bhasya.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–47}}<ref>[http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Brahma%20Sutras%20-%20According%20to%20Sri%20Sankara%20by%20Swami%20Vireswarananda%20%5BSanskrit-English%5D.pdf Brahmasutra-bhasya 1.1.4], S Vireswarananda (Translator), p. 35</ref> NB: some manuscripts list Upadesasahasri verse 1.18.133 as 2.18.133, while Mayeda lists it as 1.18.133, because of interchanged chapter numbering. See Upadesa Sahasri: A Thousand Teachings, S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), {{ISBN|978-81-7120-059-7}}, Verse 2.8.133, p. 258; Karl H Potter (2014), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 3, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-61486-1}}, p. 249}} but his thematic focus was upon [[metaphysics]] and [[soteriology]], and he took for granted the ''[[pramanas]]'',{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=47}} that is [[epistemology]] or "means to gain knowledge, reasoning methods that empower one to gain reliable knowledge".{{citation needed|date=December 2021}} According to Sengaku Mayeda, "in no place in his works [...] does he give any systematic account of them,"{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=47}} taking ''Atman-Brahman'' to be self-evident (''svapramanaka'') and self-established (''svatahsiddha''), and "an investigation of the means of knowledge is of no use for the attainment of final release."{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=47}} Mayeda notes that Shankara's arguments are "strikingly realistic and not idealistic," arguing that ''jnana'' is based on existing things (''vastutantra''), and "not upon Vedic injunction (''codanatantra'') nor upon man (''purusatantra'').{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=47}}

According to Michael Comans (aka Vasudevacharya), Shankara considered perception and inference as a primary most reliable epistemic means, and where these means to knowledge help one gain "what is beneficial and to avoid what is harmful", there is no need for or wisdom in referring to the scriptures.{{Sfn|Comans|2000|p=168}} In certain matters related to metaphysics and ethics, says Shankara, the testimony and wisdom in scriptures such as the Vedas and the Upanishads become important.{{Sfn|Comans|2000|pp=167–169}}

Merrell-Wolff states that Shankara accepts Vedas and Upanishads as a source of knowledge as he develops his philosophical theses, yet he never rests his case on the ancient texts, rather proves each thesis, point by point using the ''[[pramana]]s'' (means of knowledge) of reason and experience.<ref>Franklin Merrell-Wolff (1995), Transformations in Consciousness: The Metaphysics and Epistemology, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2675-3}}, pp. 242–260</ref><ref>Will Durant (1976), Our Oriental Heritage: The Story of Civilization, Simon & Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0-671-54800-1}}, Chapter XIX, Section VI</ref> Hacker and Phillips note that his insight into rules of reasoning and hierarchical emphasis on epistemic steps is "doubtlessly the suggestion" of Shankara in Brahma-sutra-bhasya, an insight that flowers in the works of his companion and disciple Padmapada.<ref>Stephen Phillips (2000) in Roy W. Perrett (Editor), Epistemology: Indian Philosophy, Volume 1, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3609-9}}, pp. 224–228 with notes 8, 13 and 63</ref>

====Logic versus revelation====
Stcherbatsky in 1927 criticized Shankara for demanding the use of logic from [[Madhyamika]] Buddhists, while himself resorting to revelation as a source of knowledge.{{sfn|Shcherbatsky|1927|pp=44–45}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvnb|Shcherbatsky|1927|pp=44–45}}: "Shankara accuses them of disregarding all logic and refuses to enter in a controversy with them. The position of Shankara is interesting because, at heart, he is in full agreement with the Madhyamikas, at least in the main lines, since both maintain the reality of the One-without-a-second, and the mirage of the manifold. But Shankara, as an ardent hater of Buddhism, would never confess that. He therefore treats the Madhyamika with great contempt [...] on the charge that the Madhyamika denies the possibility of cognizing the Absolute by logical methods (pramana). [[Vachaspati Mishra]] in the [[Bhamati]] rightly interprets this point as referring to the opinion of the Madhyamikas that logic is incapable to solve the question about what existence or non-existence really are. This opinion Shankara himself, as is well known, shares. He does not accept the authority of logic as a means of cognizing the Absolute, but he deems it a privilege of the Vedantin to fare without logic, since he has Revelation to fall back upon. From all his opponents, he requires strict logical methods."}} Sircar in 1933 offered a different perspective and stated, "Sankara recognizes the value of the law of contrariety and self-alienation from the standpoint of idealistic logic; and it has consequently been possible for him to integrate appearance with reality."<ref>Mahendranath Sircar (1933), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2180322 Reality in Indian Thought], The Philosophical Review, Vol. 42, No. 3, pp.&nbsp;249–271</ref>

Recent scholarship states that Shankara's arguments on revelation are about ''apta vacana'' (Sanskrit: आप्तवचन, sayings of the wise, relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).<ref name=arvindrevel/><ref>[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=Aptavacana&script=&direction=SE&link=yes Aptavacana] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne University, Germany</ref> It is part of his and Advaita Vedanta's epistemological foundation.<ref name=arvindrevel>Arvind Sharma (2008), The Philosophy of Religion and Advaita Vedanta, Penn State Press, {{ISBN|978-0-271-02832-3}}, pp. 70–71</ref> The Advaita Vedanta tradition considers such testimony epistemically valid, asserting that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly.<ref>M.

====Anubhava====
[[Anantanand Rambachan]] summarizes the widely held view on the role of ''anubhava'' in Shankara's epistemology as follows, before critiquing it:
{{Blockquote|According to these [widely represented contemporary] studies, Shankara only accorded a provisional validity to the knowledge gained by inquiry into the words of the [[Śruti]] (Vedas) and did not see the latter as the unique source (''pramana'') of ''Brahmajnana''. The affirmations of the Śruti, it is argued, need to be verified and confirmed by the knowledge gained through direct experience (''anubhava'') and the authority of the Śruti, therefore, is only secondary.{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|pp=xii–xiii}}}}

====Yoga and contemplative exercises====
Shankara considered the purity and steadiness of mind achieved in [[Yoga]] as an aid to gaining [[moksha]] knowledge, but such yogic state of mind cannot in itself give rise to such knowledge.<ref>Anantanand Rambachan (1994) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=b9EJBQG3zqUC&dq=brahma+as+opposed+to+brahman&pg=PA124 The limits of scripture: Vivekananda's reinterpretation of the Vedas.]'' University of Hawaii Press, pp. 124–125.</ref> To Shankara, that knowledge of [[Brahman]] springs only from inquiry into the teachings of the Upanishads.<ref>{{harvnb|Isaeva|1993|pp=57–58}}: "Shankara directly identifies this awakened atman with Brahman and the higher knowledge. And Brahman, reminds the Advaitist, is known only from the Upanishadic sayings".</ref> The method of yoga, encouraged in Shankara's teachings notes Comans, includes withdrawal of mind from sense objects as in Patanjali's system, but it is not complete thought suppression, instead it is a "meditative exercise of withdrawal from the particular and identification with the universal, leading to contemplation of oneself as the most universal, namely, Consciousness".<ref name=michaelcomans>Michael Comans (1993), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399467 The question of the importance of Samādhi in modern and classical Advaita Vedānta], Philosophy East & West. Vol. 43, Issue 1, pp. 19–38</ref> Describing Shankara's style of yogic practice, Comans writes:
<blockquote>the type of yoga which Sankara presents here is a method of merging, as it were, the particular (visesa) into the general (samanya). For example, diverse sounds are merged in the sense of hearing, which has greater generality insofar as the sense of hearing is the locus of all sounds. The sense of hearing is merged into the mind, whose nature consists of thinking about things, and the mind is in turn merged into the intellect, which Sankara then says is made into 'mere cognition' (vijnanamatra); that is, all particular cognitions resolve into their universal, which is cognition as such, thought without any particular object. And that in turn is merged into its universal, mere Consciousness (prajnafnaghana), upon which everything previously referred to ultimately depends.<ref name=michaelcomans/> </blockquote>

Shankara rejected those yoga system variations that suggest complete thought suppression leads to liberation, as well the view that the [[Shruti]]s teach liberation as something apart from the knowledge of the oneness of the Self. Knowledge alone and insights relating to true nature of things, taught Shankara, is what liberates. He placed great emphasis on the study of the Upanisads, emphasizing them as necessary and sufficient means to gain Self-liberating knowledge. Sankara also emphasized the need for and the role of ''Guru'' (Acharya, teacher) for such knowledge.<ref name=michaelcomans/>

====''Samanvayat Tatparya Linga''====
Shankara cautioned against cherrypicking a phrase or verse out of context from Vedic literature, and remarks in the opening chapter of his Brahmasutra-Bhasya that the ''Anvaya'' (theme or purport) of any treatise can only be correctly understood if one attends to the ''Samanvayat Tatparya Linga'', that is six characteristics of the text under consideration: (1) the common in ''Upakrama'' (introductory statement) and ''Upasamhara'' (conclusions); (2) ''Abhyasa'' (message repeated); (3) ''Apurvata'' (unique proposition or novelty); (4) ''Phala'' (fruit or result derived); (5) ''Arthavada'' (explained meaning, praised point) and (6) ''Yukti'' (verifiable reasoning).<ref>George Thibaut (Translator), Brahma Sutras: With Commentary of Shankara, Reprinted as {{ISBN|978-1-60506-634-9}}, pp. 31–33 verse 1.1.4</ref>{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–53}} While this methodology has roots in the theoretical works of [[Nyaya]] school of Hinduism, Shankara consolidated and applied it with his unique exegetical method called ''Anvaya-Vyatireka'', which states that for proper understanding one must "accept only meanings that are compatible with all characteristics" and "exclude meanings that are incompatible with any".<ref>Mayeda & Tanizawa (1991), Studies on Indian Philosophy in Japan, 1963–1987, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 41, No. 4, pp. 529–535</ref><ref>Michael Comans (1996), Śankara and the Prasankhyanavada, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 49–71</ref>

===The ''Mahāvākyas'' - the identity of Ātman and Brahman ===
''Moksha'', liberation from suffering and rebirth and attaining immortality, is attained by disidentification from the body-mind complex and gaining self-knowledge as being in essence ''Atman'', and attaining knowledge of the identity of ''Ātman'' and [[Brahman]].{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}{{sfn|Rambachan|2006|p=26}} According to Shankara, the individual Ātman and Brahman seem different at the empirical level of reality, but this difference is only an illusion, and at the highest level of reality they are really identical.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=14}} The real self is ''Sat'', "the Existent," that is, ''Ātman-Brahman''.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=12, 172}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=49}}{{refn|group=note|name=Brahman}} Whereas the difference between Ātman and non-Ātman is deemed self-evident, knowledge of the identity of Ātman and Brahman is revealed by the ''shruti'', especially the Upanishadic statement ''tat tvam asi''.

====''Mahāvākyas''====
According to Shankara, a large number of Upanishadic statements reveal the identity of ''Ātman'' and ''Brahman''. In the Advaita Vedānta tradition, four of those statements, the ''[[Mahāvākyas]]'', which are taken literal, in contrast to other statements, have a special importance in revealing this identity.<ref name=Long>{{Cite book|last=Long|first=Jeffery D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWXRDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mah%C4%81v%C4%81kyas+advaita&pg=PA245|title=Historical Dictionary of Hinduism|date=2020-04-15|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-5381-2294-5|language=en}}</ref>{{sfn|Braue|1984|p=81}} They are:

====''That you are''====
The longest chapter of Shankara's ''[[Upadesasahasri]]'', chapter 18, "That Art Thou," is devoted to considerations on the insight "I am ever-free, the existent" (''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|sat]]''), and the identity expressed in [[Chandogya Upanishad#Sixth Prapāṭhaka|Chandogya Upanishad 6.8.7]] in the ''[[Mahāvākyas|mahavakya]]'' (great sentence) "''tat tvam asi''", "that thou art."{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=50, 172}}{{sfn|Lipner|2000|p=57}} In this statement, according to Shankara, ''tat'' refers to ''[[Satya|Sat]]'',{{sfn|Lipner|2000|p=57}} "the Existent"{{sfn|Lipner|2000|pp=55 note 9; 57}}{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=8}}{{sfn|Olivelle|2008|p=151-152}}{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=172, Up.18.3, 18.6, 18.7}} Existence, Being,<ref name="ShankaraBasya">Shankara, [http://shankarabhashya.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=343e9e12ffd6b71c499e1722e8813e90&topic=87.0 ''Chandogya Upanishad Bhasya - Chapter 6 (Tat Tvam Asi)''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209212211/http://shankarabhashya.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=343e9e12ffd6b71c499e1722e8813e90&topic=87.0 |date=9 February 2022 }}</ref> or Brahman,{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=172, Up.18.6}} the Real, the "Root of the world,"{{sfn|Lipner|2000|p=57}}{{refn|group=note|While the Vedanta tradition equates ''sat'' ("the Existent") with Brahman, the Chandogya Upanishad itself does not refer to Brahman.{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=8}}{{sfn|Black|2012|p=36}} {{harvtxt|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=8}}: "Although the text does not use the term ''brahman'', the Vedanta tradition is that the Existent (''sat'') referred to is no other than Brahman."}} the true essence or root or origin of everything that exists.{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=8}}{{sfn|Olivelle|2008|p=151-152}}<ref name="ShankaraBasya"/> "Tvam" refers to one's real I, ''pratyagatman'' or inner Self,{{sfn|Lipner|2000|pp=60, 62}} the "direct Witness within everything,"{{sfn|Lipner|2000|p=60}} "free from caste, family, and purifying ceremonies,"{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=218 (up.II.1.24)}} the essence, ''Atman'', which the individual at the core is.<ref name=maxmuller61>Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/92/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad 6.1-6.16], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, pages 92–109 with footnotes</ref><ref>Dominic Goodall (1996), Hindu Scriptures, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520207783}}, pages 136–137</ref> As Shankara states in the ''[[Upadesasahasri]]'': 
{{blockquote|Up.I.174: "Through such sentences as "Thou art That" one knows one's own ''Atman'', the Witness of all the internal organs." Up.I.18.190: "Through such sentences as "[Thou art] the Existent" [...] right knowledge concerning the inner ''Atman'' will become clearer." Up.I.18.193-194: "In the sentence "Thou art That" [...] [t]he word "That" means inner ''Atman''."{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=190-192}}}}

The statement "tat tvam asi" sheds the false notion that ''Atman'' is different from ''Brahman''.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=91, 219 (Up.II.1.28)}} According toNakamura, the non-duality of ''atman'' and ''Brahman'' "is a famous characteristic of Sankara's thought, but it was already taught by Sundarapandya"{{sfn|Nakamura|1999|p=675}} ({{Circa|600 CE}} or earlier).{{sfn|Nakamura|1999|p=176}} Shankara cites Sundarapandya in his comments to ''Brahma Sutra'' verse I.1.4:
{{blockquote|When the metaphorical or false ''atman'' is non-existent, [the ideas of my] child, [my] body are sublated. Therefore, when it is realized that 'I am the existent ''Brahman, atman{{'}}'', how can anyduty exist?{{sfn|Nakamura|1999|p=178}}}}

From this, and a large number of other accordances, Nakamura concludes that Shankar was not an original thinker, but "a synthesizer of existing Advaita and the rejuvenator, as well as a defender, of ancient learning."{{sfn|Nakamura|1999|p=679}}

====Meditation on the ''Mahāvākya''====
In the ''Upadesasahasri Shankara'', Shankara is ambivalent on the need for meditation on the Upanishadic ''mahavyaka''. He states that "right knowledge arises at the moment of hearing,"{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=182 (Up.I.18.103-104)}} and rejects ''prasamcaksa'' or ''prasamkhyana'' meditation, that is, meditation on the meaning of the sentences, and in Up.II.3 recommends ''parisamkhyana'',{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=173-174 (Up.I.18.9-19); p.196 note 13}} separating ''Atman'' from everything that is not ''Atman'', that is, the sense-objects and sense-organs, and the pleasant and unpleasant things and merit and demerit connected with them.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=251-253 (Up.II.3)}} Yet, Shankara then concludes with declaring that only ''Atman'' exists, stating that "all the sentences of the ''Upanishads'' concerning non-duality of ''Atman'' should be fully contemplated, should be contemplated."{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=253 (Up.II.3)}} As Mayeda states, "how they [''prasamcaksa'' or ''prasamkhyana'' versus ''parisamkhyana''] differ from each other in not known."{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=196 note 13}}

''Prasamkhyana'' was advocated by Mandana Misra,{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=155}} the older contemporary of Shankara who was the most influential Advaitin until the 10th century.{{sfn|King|2002|p=128}}{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|pp=33-34}}{{refn|group=note|name=King2002_MandanaMisra}} "According to Mandana, the ''mahavakyas'' are incapable, by themselves, of bringing about ''brahmajnana''. The ''Vedanta-vakyas'' convey an indirect knowledge which is made direct only by deep meditation (''prasamkhyana''). The latter is a continuous contemplation of the purport of the ''mahavakyas''.{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=155-156}} Vācaspati Miśra, a student of Mandana Misra, agreed with Mandana Misra, and their stance is defended by the Bhamati-school, founded by Vācaspati Miśra.{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=156}} In contrast, the [[Vivarana]] school founded by Prakasatman ({{Circa|1200}}–1300){{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|p=40}} follows Shankara closely, arguing that the ''mahavakyas'' are the direct cause of gaining knowledge.{{sfn|Cenkner|1995|p=95}}

====Renouncement of ritualism====
Shankara, in his text ''Upadesasahasri'', discourages ritual worship such as oblations to ''Deva'' (God), because that assumes the Self within is different from the [[Brahman]].{{refn|group=note|name="ritualism"|Shankara, himself, had renounced all religious ritual acts.{{sfn|Potter|2008|p=16}}<br />For an example of Shankara's reasoning "why rites and ritual actions should be given up", see Karl Potter on p. 220;<br />Elsewhere, Shankara's ''Bhasya'' on various Upanishads repeat "give up rituals and rites", see for example [https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n375/mode/2up Shankara's Bhasya on Brihadaranyaka Upanishad] pp. 348–350, 754–757}}{{refn|group=note|name="Mookerji"}} The "doctrine of difference" is wrong, asserts Shankara, because, "he who knows the Brahman is one and he is another, does not know Brahman".<ref>Sanskrit:[http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/upadeshasaahasrii1.pdf Upadesha sahasri]<br />English Translation: S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-81-7120-059-7}}, pp. 16–17; {{oclc|218363449}}</ref>{{sfn|Potter|2008|pp=219–221}} The false notion that ''Atman'' is different from ''Brahman''{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=91, 219 (Up.II.1.28)}} is connected with the novice's conviction that (''Upadeshasahasri'' II.1.25)
{{blockquote|...I am one [and] He is another; I am ignorant, experience pleasure and pain, am bound and a transmigrator [whereas] he is essentially different from me, the god not subject to transmigration. By worshipping Him with oblation, offerings, homage and the like through the [performance of] the actions prescribed for [my] class and stage of life, I wish to get out of the ocean of transmigratory existence. How am I he?{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=91, 218}}}}

Recognizing oneself as "the Existent-''Brahman''," which is mediated by scriptural teachings, is contrasted with the notion of "I act," which is mediated by relying on sense-perception and the like.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=172-173 (Up.I.18.3-8)}} According to Shankara, the statement "Thou art That" "remove[s] the delusion of a hearer,"{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=183 (Up.I.18.99-100)}} "so through sentences as "Thou art That" one knows one's own ''Atman'', the witness of all internal organs,"{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=190 (Up.I.18.174)}} and not from any actions.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=192 (Up.I.18.196-197); p. 195 (Up.I.18.2019)}}{{refn|group=note|Up.I.18.219: "The renunciation of all actions becomes the means for discriminating the meaning of the word "Thou" since there is an [Upanisadic] teaching, "Having become calm, self-controlled [..., one sees ''Atman'' there in oneself]" (Bhr. Up. IV, 4, 23)."{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=195 (Up.I.18.2019)}}}} With this realization, the performance of rituals is prohibited, "since [the use of] rituals and their requisites is contradictory to the realization of the identity [of ''Atman''] with the highest ''Atman''."{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=85, 220 (Up.II.1.30)}}

However, Shankara also asserts that Self-knowledge is realized when one's mind is purified by an ethical life that observes [[Yamas]] such as ''Ahimsa'' (non-injury, non-violence to others in body, mind and thoughts) and [[Niyama]]s. Rituals and rites such as [[yajna]] (a fire ritual), asserts Shankara, can help draw and prepare the mind for the journey to Self-knowledge.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=92–93}} He emphasizes the need for ethics such as [[Akrodha]] and ''Yamas'' during [[Brahmacharya]], stating the lack of ethics as causes that prevent students from attaining knowledge.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=92–93}}{{sfn|Potter|2008|pp=218–219}}

=== ''Īśvara'' ===
Shankara, while rejecting empirical reality due to his position of nonduality, still attributes value to the universe as it identifies with ''Īśvara''. He sometimes blurs the distinction between ''Īśvara'' and ''Brahman'', using various terms for both. However, he generally separates ''Īśvara'', associated with the universe and its attributes, from the absolute nondual Brahman. Drawing from the Upanishads, Shankara sees ''Īśvara'' as the universe's material and intelligent cause, emanating it through the power of ''maya'', thereby making the universe sentient and self-aware. In relation to the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]'', Shankara compares the universe's unmanifest state to ''Īśvara'' in a deep dreamless cosmic state.<ref>{{Citation |last=Dalal |first=Neil |title=Śaṅkara |date=2021 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2021/entries/shankara/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |access-date=2023-10-28 |edition=Winter 2021 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref>

==Influences of Mahayana Buddhism==
{{See also|Advaita Vedanta#Buddhist influences|l1=Buddhist influences on Advaita Vedanta}}

Shankara's Vedanta shows similarities with [[Mahayana Buddhism]]; opponents have even accused Shankara of being a "crypto-Buddhist,"{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=14}}{{sfn|Biderman|1978|pp=405–413}}{{sfn|King|1995|p=183}}{{refn|group=note|name="crypto-Buddhist"|{{harvtxt|King|1995|p=183}}: "It is well-known that Sankara was criticized by later (rival) Vedantins as a crypto-Buddhist (''pracchana bauddha'').}} a qualification which is rejected by the Advaita Vedanta tradition, given the differences between these two schools. According to Shankara, a major difference between Advaita and Mahayana Buddhism are their views on Atman and Brahman.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=60, 145–154}} According to both Loy and Jayatilleke, more differences can be discerned.<ref name=david>David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, 23(1), pp. 65–74</ref><ref>KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0619-1}}, pp. 246–249, from note 385 onwards</ref>

===Similarities and influences===
Despite Shankara's criticism of certain schools of Mahayana Buddhism, Shankara's philosophy shows strong similarities with the Mahayana Buddhist philosophy which he attacks.{{sfn|Shcherbatsky|1927|pp=44–45}} According to S.N. Dasgupta,
{{blockquote|Shankara and his followers borrowed much of their dialectic form of criticism from the Buddhists. His [[Brahman]] was very much like the [[Śūnyatā|sunya]] of Nagarjuna [...] The debts of Shankara to the self-luminosity of the Vijnanavada Buddhism can hardly be overestimated. There seems to be much truth in the accusations against Shankara by [[Vijnanabhiksu|Vijnana Bhiksu]] and others that he was a hidden Buddhist himself. I am led to think that Shankara's philosophy is largely a compound of [[Yogacara|Vijnanavada]] and [[Madhyamaka|Sunyavada]] Buddhism with the Upanisad notion of the permanence of self superadded.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1997|p=494}} }}

According to Mudgal, Shankara's Advaita and the Buddhist Madhyamaka view of ultimate reality are compatible because they are both transcendental, indescribable, non-dual and only arrived at through a ''[[via negativa]]'' ([[neti neti]]). Mudgal concludes therefore that
{{blockquote|...&nbsp;the difference between [[Shunyata|Sunyavada]] (Mahayana) philosophy of Buddhism and [[Advaita]] philosophy of Hinduism may be a matter of emphasis, not of kind.<ref>Mudgal, S.G. (1975), Advaita of Shankara: A Reappraisal, New Delhi: Motilal Banarasidass, p. 4</ref>}}

Some Hindu scholars criticized Advaita for its ''Maya'' and non-theistic doctrinal similarities with Buddhism.<ref>[[Julius Lipner]] (1986), The Face of Truth: A Study of Meaning and Metaphysics in the Vedantic Theology of Rāmānuja, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887060397}}, pp. 120–123</ref>{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1–42}} [[Ramanuja]], the founder of Vishishtadvaita Vedānta, accused Adi Shankara of being a ''Prachanna Bauddha'', that is, a "crypto-Buddhist",{{sfn|Biderman|1978|pp=405–413}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=14}} and someone who was undermining theistic [[Bhakti]] devotionalism.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1–42}} The non-Advaita scholar [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]] of the Bhedabheda Vedānta tradition, similarly around 800 CE, accused Shankara's Advaita as "this despicable broken down Mayavada that has been chanted by the Mahayana Buddhists", and a school that is undermining the ritual duties set in Vedic orthodoxy.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1–42}}

The qualification of "crypto-Buddhist" is rejected by the Advaita Vedanta tradition, highlighting their respective views on ''Atman'', ''Anatta'' and ''Brahman''.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=60, 145–154}}{{refn|group=note|name=self_no-self}} There are differences in the conceptual means of "liberation." [[Nirvana]], a term more often used in Buddhism, is the liberating 'blowing out' of craving, aided by the realization and acceptance that there is no Self ([[anatman]]) as the center of perception, craving, and delusion. [[Moksha]], a term more common in Hinduism, is the similar liberating release from craving and ignorance, yet aided by the realization and acceptance that one's inner Self is not a personal 'ego-self', but a Universal Self.<ref name=david/><ref>Thomas McFaul (2006), The Future of Peace and Justice in the Global Village: The Role of the World Religions in the Twenty-first Century, Praeger, {{ISBN|978-0-275-99313-9}}, p. 39</ref>

* Shankara, ''Upadesasahasri'' I.18.3: "I am ever-free, the existent" (''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|Sat]]''). I.18.6: "The two [contradictory] notions "I am the Existent-''Brahman''" and "I act," have ''Atman'' as their witness. It is considered more reasonable to give up only [that one] of the two [notions] which arises from ignorance. I.18.7: "The notion, "I am the Existent," arises from right means of knowledge [while] the other notion has its origin in fallacious means of knowledge."{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=172}}
* {{harvnb|Sivananda|1993|p=219}}: "Brahman (the Absolute) is alone real; this world is unreal; and the Jiva or individual soul is non-different from Brahman."
* {{harvnb|Deutsch|1973|p=54}}: "[the] essential status [of the individual human person] is that of unqualified reality, of identity with the Absolute [...] the self (''jiva'') is only misperceived: the self is really Brahman."
* {{harvnb|Koller|2013|pp=100–101}}: "Atman, which is identical to Brahman, is ultimately the only reality and [...] the appearance of plurality is entirely the work of ignorance [...] the self is ultimately of the nature of Atman/Brahman [...] Brahman alone is ultimately real."
* {{harvnb|Bowker|2000}}: "There is only Brahman, which is necessarily undifferentiated. It follows that there cannot even be a difference, or duality, between the human subject, or self, and Brahman, for Brahman must be that very self (since Brahman is the reality underlying all appearance). The goal of human life and wisdom must, therefore, be the realization that the self (ātman) is Brahman."
* {{harvnb|Menon|2012}}: "The experiencing self (jīva) and the transcendental self of the Universe (ātman) are in reality identical (both are Brahman), though the individual self seems different as space within a container seems different from space as such. These cardinal doctrines are represented in the anonymous verse "brahma satyam jagan mithya; jīvo brahmaiva na aparah" (Brahman is alone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman)."
{{harvtxt|Hacker|1995|p=88}} notes that Shankara uses two groups of words to denote 'atman': "One group - principally ''jiva'', ''vijnanatman'', and ''sarira'' - expresses the illusory aspect of the soul [...] But in addition there are the two expressions ''atman'' and ''pratyagatman''. These also designate the individual soul, but in its real aspect." {{Harvtxt|Mayeda|1992|pp=11, 14}} uses the word ''pratyagatman''; {{harvtxt|Sivananda|1993|p=219}}, {{harvtxt|Deutsch|1973|p=54}}, and {{harvtxt|Menon|2012}} use the term ''jiva'' when referring to the identity of ''atman'' and ''Brahman''.}}

<ref group=note name="Mookerji">Compare {{harvnb|Mookerji|2011}} on [[Svādhyāya]] (Vedic learning). {{harvtxt|Mookerji|2011|pp=29–31}} notes that the Rigveda, and Sayana's commentary, contain passages criticizing as fruitless mere recitation of the ''Ŗik'' (words) without understanding their inner meaning or essence, the knowledge of ''dharma'' and ''Parabrahman''. {{harvtxt|Mookerji|2011|pp=29, 34}} concludes that in the Rigvedic education of the mantras "the contemplation and comprehension of [[Nirukta|their meaning]] was considered as more important and vital to education than their mere mechanical repetition and correct pronunciation." {{harvtxt|Mookerji|2011|p=35}} refers to Sayana as stating that "the mastery of texts, ''akshara-praptī'', is followed by ''[[artha]]-[[Buddhi|bodha]]'', perception of their meaning." (''[[Artha]]'' may also mean "goal, purpose or essence," depending on the context. See:
[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=artha&direction=SE&script=HK&link=yes&beginning=0 Sanskrit English Dictionary] University of Kloen, Germany (2009); Karl Potter (1998), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4, {{ISBN|81-208-0310-8}}, Motilal Banarsidass, pp 610 (note 17).) According to {{harvtxt|Mookerji|2011|p=36}}, "the realization of [[rta|Truth]]" and the knowledge of ''[[paramatman]]'' as revealed to the ''rishis'' is the real aim of Vedic learning, and not the mere recitation of texts.</ref>
