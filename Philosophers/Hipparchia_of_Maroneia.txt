'''Hipparchia of Maroneia''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɪ|ˈ|p|ɑr|k|i|ə}}; {{langx|el|Ἱππαρχία ἡ Μαρωνεῖτις}}; fl. c. 325 BC) was a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] [[women in philosophy|philosopher]], and wife of [[Crates of Thebes]]. She was the sister of [[Metrokles]], the cynic philosopher.<ref>[https://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/sol/sol-entries/iota/517 Suda, Iota 517]</ref>
She was born in [[Maroneia]], but her family moved to [[Athens]], where Hipparchia came into contact with Crates, the most famous Cynic philosopher in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] at that time. She fell in love with him, and, despite the disapproval of her parents, she married him. She went on to live a life of Cynic [[poverty]] on the streets of Athens with her husband.

Little survives of her own philosophical views, but like most Cynics, her influence lies in the example of her life, choosing a way of life which was usually considered unacceptable for respectable women of the time. The story of her attraction to Crates, and her rejection of conventional values, became a popular theme for later writers.

==Life==
Hipparchia was born c. 350 BC in [[Maroneia]], [[Thrace]].<ref name="diog96">Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 96</ref><ref name="suda1">Suda, ''Hipparchia''.</ref>  Her family came to [[Athens]], where Hipparchia's brother, [[Metrocles]], became a pupil of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher [[Crates of Thebes]].<ref name="diog94">Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 94</ref>  Hipparchia fell in love with Crates, and developed such a passion for him, that she told her parents that if they refused to allow her to marry him, she would kill herself. They begged Crates to dissuade her, and he stood before her, removed his clothes, and said, "Here is the bridegroom, and this is his property."<ref name="diog96"/>  Hipparchia, however, was quite happy with this; she adopted the Cynic life assuming the same clothes that he wore, and appearing with him in public everywhere.<ref name="diog97">Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 97</ref> Crates called their marriage "dog-coupling" (''cynogamy'').<ref name="suda2">Suda, ''Krates''.</ref> We are told that they lived in the [[stoa]]s and porticoes of Athens,<ref>Musonius Rufus, 14. 4.</ref> and both [[Sextus Empiricus]]<ref>[[Sextus Empiricus]] ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' Book I section 153</ref>  and the Latin-language writer [[Apuleius]] wrote accounts of their [[Public sex|having sex, publicly, in broad daylight]].<ref>Apuleius, ''Florida'' 14.</ref><ref name="long42">{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=42}}</ref> Although this would have been consistent with Cynic shamelessness (''anaideia''), the mere fact that Hipparchia adopted male clothes and lived on equal terms with her husband would have been enough to shock Athenian society.<ref name="long42"/> Hipparchia had at least two children, a daughter,<ref name="diog93">Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 93</ref> and a son named Pasicles.<ref name="suda2"/><ref name="diog88">Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 88</ref> It is not known how or when she died. There is an [[epigram]] ascribed to [[Antipater of Sidon]], as to what may have been written on her tomb:
<blockquote><poem>
I, Hipparchia chose not the tasks of rich-robed woman, but the manly life of the Cynic.
Brooch-clasped tunics, well-clad shoes, and perfumed headscarves pleased me not;
But with wallet and fellow staff, together with coarse cloak and bed of hard ground,
My name shall be greater than [[Atalanta]]: for wisdom is better than mountain running.<ref>''Greek Anthology'', 7.413. This translation based on those of: [[William Roger Paton|William R. Paton]], ''The [[Greek Anthology]]'' (1918); Arthur Way, ''Greek Anthology'' (1939); Mary Ellen Waithe, ''A History of Women Philosophers'' (1991).</ref></poem></blockquote>

==Philosophy==
[[File:Crates and Hipparchia Villa Farnesina.jpg|thumb|Roman wall painting of Hipparchia and Crates from the [[Villa Farnesina]], [[Rome]]. Hipparchia approaches Crates carrying a box, implying that she has come to Crates as a potential bride bearing her possessions.<ref>Diskin Clay, ''Picturing Diogenes'', in R. Bracht Branham, Marie-Odile Goulet-Cazé, (2000), ''The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy'', pp. 372–73.</ref>]]

The ''[[Suda]]'' says she wrote some philosophical treatises and some letters addressed to [[Theodorus the Atheist]].<ref name="suda1"/> None of these have survived. There are some accounts of her encounters with Theodorus:
<blockquote>When she went into a symposium with Crates, she tested Theodoros the atheist by proposing a [[sophism]] like this: "That which if Theodoros did, he would not be said to do wrong, neither should Hipparchia be said to do wrong if she does it. Theodoros hitting himself does not do wrong, nor does Hipparchia do wrong hitting Theodoros." He did not reply to what she said, but pulled up her garment.<ref name="suda1"/></blockquote>
We are told she was neither offended nor ashamed by this "as most women would have been."<ref name="diog97"/> We are also told that when Theodorus (quoting a line from ''[[The Bacchae]]'' of [[Euripides]]) said to her:
"Who is the woman who has left behind the shuttles of the loom?" she replied
<blockquote>I, Theodorus, am that person, but do I appear to you to have come to a wrong decision, if I devote that time to philosophy, which I otherwise should have spent at the loom?"<ref name="diog98">Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 98</ref></blockquote>
Many other anecdotes existed about Hipparchia,<ref name="diog98"/> but they have been mostly lost. We know also that Crates taught [[Zeno of Citium]]; it is impossible to say what influence Hipparchia had on Zeno in his development of [[Stoicism]], but Zeno's own radical views on [[love]] and [[sex]] (as evidenced in his ''[[The Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'') may have been influenced by the relationship of Hipparchia and Crates.<ref name=schofield>{{Harvnb|Schofield|1991}}</ref>

==Later influence==
[[File:Hipparchia - Illustrium philosophorum et sapientum effigies ab eorum numistatibus extractae.png|thumb|Engraving from 1580]]
Hipparchia's fame undoubtedly rests on the fact that she was a woman practising philosophy and living a life on equal terms with her husband.  Both facts were unusual for ancient [[Greece]] or [[Rome]].<ref name="long42"/>  Although there were other women who chose to live as Cynics, Hipparchia is the only one whose name is known.<ref>''Nicion'', a courtesan nicknamed the ''Dog-Fly'', appears in the ''Banquet of the Cynics'' quoted by [[Athenaeus]] (iv.157a), but there is no reason to suppose she is not fictional.</ref>  She is also the only woman to have her own entry among the 82 philosophers in [[Diogenes Laërtius]]' ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', and she continued to fascinate later writers.  There are, for example, a set of ''[[Cynic epistles]]'', written in the 1st century AD, some of which purport to give advice from Crates to Hipparchia:
<blockquote>Our philosophy is called Cynic not because we are indifferent to everything, but because we aggressively endure what others, due to being soft or general opinion find unbearable.  So it is for this reason and not the former that they have called us Cynics.  Stay, therefore, and continue as a Cynic—for you are not by nature worse than we [men] are, for neither are female dogs worse than male—in order that you might be freed from Nature, as all [people] either because of law or due to vices, live as slaves.<ref>Pseudo-Crates, ''Epistle'' 29, from Wimbush, L., (1990), ''Ascetic Behavior in Greco-Roman Antiquity: A Sourcebook''.</ref></blockquote>

Other letters mention events, which, like a lot of the ''Cynic epistles'', may be based on actual anecdotes which existed at the time. In two of the letters,<ref>Pseudo-Crates, ''Epistle'' 30, 32</ref> we are told that Hipparchia sent a cloak to Crates which she had made. Crates, though, fears that she may have undertaken the task "so that you might appear to the masses to be someone who loves her husband." Crates urges her to renounce wool-spinning and take-up philosophy since that is the reason she married him. In another letter,<ref>Pseudo-Crates, ''Epistle'' 33</ref> Crates learns why she has taken up domestic tasks: Hipparchia, we are told, has given birth. After agreeing with her that she gave birth easily because of her Cynic training, Crates proceeds to give advice on how to rear the child:
<blockquote>Let his bath water be cold, his clothes be a cloak, his food be milk, yet not to excess. Rock him in a cradle made from a tortoise shell. ... When he is able to speak and walk, dress him, not with a sword, as [[Aethra (Greek mythology)|Aethra]] did with [[Theseus]], but with a staff and cloak and wallet, which can guard men better than swords, and send him to Athens.<ref>Pseudo-Crates, ''Epistle'' 33, from Abraham J. Malherbe, (1977), ''The Cynic Epistles, A Study Edition''. SBL</ref></blockquote>

Perhaps most remarkable is a letter purporting to come from [[Diogenes of Sinope]] addressed to the people of [[Maroneia]]:
<blockquote>You did well when you changed the name of the city and, instead of Maroneia, called it Hipparchia, its present name, since it is better for you to be named after Hipparchia, a woman, it's true, but a philosopher, than after [[Maron (mythology)|Maron]], a man who sells wine.<ref>Pseudo-Diogenes, ''Epistle'' 43, from Abraham J. Malherbe, (1977), ''The Cynic Epistles: A Study Edition''. SBL</ref></blockquote>

==Modern influence==

The story of Hipparchia's pursuit of Crates, despite the disapproval of her parents and the initial reluctance of Crates, was a popular tale from the 16th century onwards. It featured in [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s [[commonplace book]] ''Hore di ricreatione'' published in 1568,<ref>Hugh Gerald Arthur Roberts, ''Dogs' tales: representations of ancient Cynicism in French Renaissance texts'', page 85. Rodopi</ref> and it was one of the stories told by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] poet [[Jacob Cats]] in his ''Touchstone of the Wedding Ring'' (''Proefsteen van de Trou-ringh'') published in 1637.<ref>A. Agnes Sneller, ''Reading Jacob Cats'', in Els Kloek et al, (1994), ''Women of the golden age: an international debate on women in seventeenth-century Holland, England and Italy'', pp. 21–26. Uitgeverij Verloren.</ref> [[William Penn]] wrote about her in his ''No Cross, No Crown'', which he wrote in prison in 1668. For Penn she was an example of [[puritan]] discipline and virtue:<ref>William Penn, [https://archive.org/details/nocrossnocrowndi00pennuoft ''No Cross, No Crown'']</ref>
{{quote|I seek not the Pomp and Effeminacy of this World, but Knowledge and Virtue, ''Crates''; and choose a Life of Temperance, before a Life of Delicacies: For true Satisfaction, thou knowest, is in the Mind; and that Pleasure is only worth seeking, that lasts for ever.}}
Her marriage to Crates inspired [[Pierre Petit (scholar)|Pierre Petit]] to write the [[Latin]] poem ''Cynogamia, sive de Cratetis et Hipparches amoribus'' in 1676.<ref>Luis E. Navia, (1995), ''The philosophy of Cynicism: an annotated bibliography'', p. 182. Greenwood Press</ref> In the same century, [[Clemenza Ninci]], an Italian [[nun]], wrote a play entitled ''Sposalizio d'Iparchia filosofa'' (''The marriage of Hipparchia the philosopher''). The play deals with Hipparchia's desire to marry Crates, and the obstacles which are placed in her way until she achieves her desire. The play was written for [[convent]] performance (with all the parts played by nuns) and was not published until the 19th century.<ref>Katharina M. Wilson, (1991), ''An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers'', p. 918. Taylor & Francis.</ref> The [[Germany|German]] writer [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] made Crates and Hipparchia the heroes of his [[epistolary novel]] ''Krates und Hipparchia'' (1804). Crates and Hipparchia feature in [[Marcel Schwob]]'s ''Vies Imaginaires'' (''Imaginary Lives'', 1896). The American writer [[H.D.]] wrote a novella ''Hipparchia'' (1921), a highly fictionalised account of Hipparchia's daughter, (whom H.D. imagines is also called Hipparchia).<ref>H.D., (1921), ''Palimpsest''</ref> Hipparchia was an inspiration for the book ''L'Étude et le rouet'' (1989) (translated in English under the title ''Hipparchia's Choice'') by the French [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosopher]] [[Michèle Le Dœuff]], a reflection on women's relation to philosophy.<ref>Peter France, (1995), ''The New Oxford Companion to Literature in French'', p. 450</ref> [[Martha Nussbaum]], in her speech to the [[University of Chicago Law School]] graduating class of 2010, presented Hipparchia'a life as an illustrative example of the benefits of continuing education beyond academic settings.<ref>[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/graduation06162010 ''The Law School Celebrates New Graduates''], University of Chicago Law School</ref>
