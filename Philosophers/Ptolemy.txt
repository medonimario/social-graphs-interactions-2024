==Biography==
Ptolemy's date of birth and birthplace are both unknown. The 14th-century astronomer [[Theodore Meliteniotes]] wrote that Ptolemy's birthplace was [[Ptolemais Hermiou]], a Greek city in the [[Thebaid]] region of Egypt (now El Mansha, [[Sohag Governorate]]). This attestation is quite late, however, and there is no evidence to support it.<ref name=citizenship>{{harvtxt|Neugebauer|1975|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vO5FCVIxz2YC&pg=PA834 834]}}</ref>{{efn|
"The only place mentioned in any of Ptolemy's observations is Alexandria, and there is no reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else. The statement by Theodore Meliteniotes that he was born in Ptolemais Hermiou (in Upper Egypt) could be correct, but it is late ({{circa|1360}}) and {{nobr|unsupported." — Toomer & Jones (2018)<ref>

The name ''Claudius'' is a Roman name, belonging to the [[Claudia gens|''gens'' Claudia]]; the peculiar multipart form of the whole name ''Claudius Ptolemaeus'' is a Roman custom, characteristic of Roman citizens. This indicates that Ptolemy would have been a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]].<ref name=citizenship/> Gerald Toomer, the translator of Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' into English, suggests that citizenship was probably granted to one of Ptolemy's ancestors by either the emperor [[Claudius]] or the emperor [[Nero]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Toomer|1970|p=[http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/Dictionary%20of%20Scientific%20Biography/Ptolemy%20(Toomer).pdf 187]}}</ref>

The 9th century [[Persians|Persian]] [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|astronomer]] [[Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi]] mistakenly presents Ptolemy as a member of [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic Egypt's royal lineage]], stating that the descendants of the Alexandrine general and Pharaoh [[Ptolemy I Soter]] were wise "and included Ptolemy the Wise, who composed the book of the ''Almagest''". Abu Ma'shar recorded a belief that a different member of this royal line "composed the book on astrology and attributed it to Ptolemy". Historical confusion on this point can be inferred from Abu Ma'shar's subsequent remark: "It is sometimes said that the very learned man who wrote the book of astrology also wrote the book of the ''Almagest''.

And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles.

Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek.

Ptolemy's ''Mathēmatikē Syntaxis'' ({{Langx|el|Μαθηματικὴ Σύνταξις}}, {{Lit|Mathematical Systematic Treatise}}), better known as the ''[[Almagest]]'', is the only surviving comprehensive ancient treatise on astronomy. Although [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] had developed arithmetical techniques for calculating and predicting astronomical phenomena, these were not based on any underlying model of the heavens; early Greek astronomers, on the other hand, provided qualitative geometrical models to "save the appearances" of celestial phenomena without the ability to make any predictions.<ref>

Ptolemy, following Hipparchus, derived each of his geometrical models for the Sun, Moon, and the planets from selected astronomical observations done in the spanning of more than 800&nbsp;years; however, many astronomers have for centuries suspected that some of his models' parameters were adopted independently of observations.<ref>

Because of its reputation, it was widely sought and translated twice into Latin [[Latin translations of the 12th century|in the 12th century]], once in Sicily and again in Spain.<ref>Charles Homer Haskins, ''Studies in the History of Mediaeval Science'', New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing, 1967, reprint of the Cambridge, Mass., 1927 edition</ref> Ptolemy's planetary models, like those of the majority of his predecessors, were geocentric and almost universally accepted until the reappearance of [[heliocentric]] models during the [[scientific revolution]].

====Modern reassessment====
Under the scrutiny of modern scholarship, and the cross-checking of observations contained in the ''Almagest'' against figures produced through backwards extrapolation, various patterns of errors have emerged within the work.{{sfn|Wade|1977}}{{sfn|Lewis|1979}} A prominent miscalculation is Ptolemy's use of measurements that he claimed were taken at noon, but which systematically produce readings now shown to be off by half an hour, as if the observations were taken at 12:30pm.{{sfn|Wade|1977}}

The overall quality of Ptolemy's observations has been challenged by several modern scientists, but prominently by [[Robert R. Newton]] in his 1977 book ''The Crime of Claudius Ptolemy'', which asserted that Ptolemy fabricated many of his observations to fit his theories.{{sfn|Goldstein|1978}} Newton accused Ptolemy of systematically inventing data or doctoring the data of earlier astronomers, and labelled him "the most successful fraud in the history of science".{{sfn|Wade|1977}} One striking error noted by Newton was an autumn equinox said to have been observed by Ptolemy and "measured with the greatest care" at 2pm on 25 September 132, when the equinox should have been observed around 9:55am the day prior.{{sfn|Wade|1977}} In attempting to disprove Newton, Herbert Lewis also found himself agreeing that "Ptolemy was an outrageous fraud,"{{sfn|Lewis|1979}} and that "all those result capable of statistical analysis point beyond question towards fraud and against accidental error".{{sfn|Lewis|1979}}

The charges laid by Newton and others have been the subject of wide discussions and received significant push back from other scholars against the findings.{{sfn|Wade|1977}} [[Owen Gingerich]], while agreeing that the ''Almagest'' contains "some remarkably fishy numbers",{{sfn|Wade|1977}} including in the matter of the 30-hour displaced equinox, which he noted aligned perfectly with predictions made by [[Hipparchus]] 278 years earlier,{{sfn|Gingerich|1980}} rejected the qualification of fraud.{{sfn|Wade|1977}} Objections were also raised by [[Bernard R. Goldstein|Bernard Goldstein]], who questioned Newton's findings and suggested that he had misunderstood the secondary literature, while noting that issues with the accuracy of Ptolemy's observations had long been known.{{sfn|Goldstein|1978}} Other authors have pointed out that instrument warping or atmospheric refraction may also explain some of Ptolemy's observations at a wrong time.<ref>

In 2022 the first Greek fragments of Hipparchus' lost star catalog were discovered in a [[palimpsest]] and they debunked accusations made by the French astronomer [[Jean_Baptiste_Joseph_Delambre|Delambre]] in the early 1800s which were repeated by R.R. Newton. Specifically, it proved Hipparchus was not the sole source of Ptolemy's catalog, as they both had claimed, and proved that Ptolemy did not simply copy Hipparchus' measurements and adjust them to account for precession of the equinoxes, as they had claimed. Scientists analyzing the charts concluded:

<blockquote>It also confirms that Ptolemy’s Star Catalogue was not based solely on data from Hipparchus’ Catalogue.<br/>

... These observations are consistent with the view that Ptolemy composed his star catalogue by combining various sources, including Hipparchus’ catalogue, his own observations and, possibly, those of other authors.<ref>

=== ''Handy Tables'' ===
The ''[[Handy Tables]]'' ({{Langx|el|Πρόχειροι κανόνες}}) are a set of astronomical tables, together with canons for their use. To facilitate astronomical calculations, Ptolemy tabulated all the data needed to compute the positions of the Sun, Moon and planets, the rising and setting of the stars, and [[eclipses]] of the Sun and Moon, making it a useful tool for astronomers and astrologers. The tables themselves are known through [[Theon of Alexandria]]'s version. Although Ptolemy's ''Handy Tables'' do not survive as such in Arabic or in Latin, they represent the prototype of most Arabic and Latin astronomical tables or ''[[Zij|zījes]]''.<ref>

Additionally, the introduction to the ''Handy Tables'' survived separately from the tables themselves (apparently part of a gathering of some of Ptolemy's shorter writings) under the title ''Arrangement and Calculation of the Handy Tables''.<ref>

The ''Planetary Hypotheses'' ({{Langx|el|Ὑποθέσεις τῶν πλανωμένων}}, {{Lit|Hypotheses of the Planets}}) is a [[Cosmology|cosmological]] work, probably one of the last written by Ptolemy, in two books dealing with the structure of the universe and the laws that govern [[Celestial mechanics|celestial motion]].<ref>

=== Other works ===
The ''Analemma'' is a short treatise where Ptolemy provides a method for specifying the location of the Sun in three pairs of locally oriented coordinate arcs as a function of the declination of the Sun, the terrestrial latitude, and the hour. The key to the approach is to represent the solid configuration in a plane diagram that Ptolemy calls the ''[[analemma]]''.<ref>{{cite book | chapter-url=https://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/pdf/10.1484/M.PALS-EB.5.120173 | doi=10.1484/M.PALS-EB.5.120173 | chapter=Mathematical Methods in Ptolemy's ''Analemma'' | title=Ptolemy's Science of the Stars in the Middle Ages | date=2020 | last1=Sidoli | first1=Nathan | pages=35–77 | isbn=978-2-503-58639-7 | s2cid=242599669 }}</ref>

Ptolemy also erected an inscription in a temple at [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]], around 146–147&nbsp;AD, known as the ''Canobic Inscription''. Although the inscription has not survived, someone in the sixth century transcribed it, and manuscript copies preserved it through the Middle Ages. It begins: "To the saviour god, Claudius Ptolemy (dedicates) the first principles and models of astronomy", following by a catalogue of numbers that define a system of celestial mechanics governing the motions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars.<ref>

In 2023, archaeologists were able to read a manuscript which gives instructions for the construction of an astronomical tool called a ''[[meteoroscope]]'' ({{math|μετεωροσκόπιον}} or {{math|μετεωροσκοπεῖον}}). The text, which comes from an eighth-century manuscript which also contains Ptolemy's ''Analemma'', was identified on the basis of both its content and linguistic analysis as being by Ptolemy.<ref>

Although [[maps]] based on scientific principles had been made since the time of [[Eratosthenes]] ({{Circa|276|195 BC}}), Ptolemy improved on [[map projection]]s.

The first part of the ''Geography'' is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. Ptolemy notes the supremacy of astronomical data over land measurements or travelers' reports, though he possessed these data for only a handful of places. Ptolemy's real innovation, however, occurs in the second part of the book, where he provides a catalogue of 8,000 localities he collected from Marinus and others, the biggest such database from antiquity.<ref name=Mittnhbr-2010>

In the third part of the ''Geography'', Ptolemy gives instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (''[[oikoumenē]]'') and of the Roman provinces, including the necessary [[Topographic map|topographic]] lists, and captions for the maps. His ''oikoumenē'' spanned 180&nbsp;degrees of longitude from the Blessed Islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the middle of [[China]], and about 80 degrees of latitude from [[Shetland]] to anti-Meroe (east coast of [[Africa]]); Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe, and an erroneous extension of China southward suggests his sources did not reach all the way to the Pacific Ocean.<ref name=Graßhf-Mittnhbr-Rinner-2017/><ref name=Isaksen-2011/>

It seems likely that the topographical tables in the second part of the work (Books&nbsp;2–7) are cumulative texts, which were altered as new knowledge became available in the centuries after Ptolemy.{{sfn|Bagrow|1945}} This means that information contained in different parts of the ''Geography'' is likely to be of different dates, in addition to containing many scribal errors. However, although the regional and [[Ptolemy's world map|world maps]] in surviving manuscripts date from {{Circa|1300&nbsp;AD}} (after the text was rediscovered by [[Maximus Planudes]]), there are some scholars who think that such maps go back to Ptolemy himself.<ref name=Mittnhbr-2010/>

Much of the content of the ''Tetrabiblos'' was collected from earlier sources; Ptolemy's achievement was to order his material in a systematic way, showing how the subject could, in his view, be rationalized.

''Harmonics'' begins with a definition of harmonic theory, with a long exposition on the relationship between reason and sense perception in corroborating theoretical assumptions. After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors, Ptolemy argues for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios (as opposed to the ideas advocated by followers of [[Aristoxenus]]), backed up by empirical observation (in contrast to the excessively theoretical approach of the [[Pythagoreans]]).<ref>

Ptolemy introduces the ''harmonic canon'' (Greek name) or ''[[monochord]]'' (Latin name), which is an experimental musical apparatus that he used to measure relative pitches, and used to describe to his readers how to demonstrate the relations discussed in the following chapters for themselves. After the early exposition on to build and use monochord to test proposed tuning systems, Ptolemy proceeds to discuss [[Pythagorean tuning]] (and how to demonstrate that their idealized musical scale fails in practice). The Pythagoreans believed that the mathematics of music should be based on only the one specific ratio of 3:2, the [[perfect fifth]], and believed that tunings mathematically exact to their system would prove to be melodious, if only the extremely large numbers involved could be calculated (by hand). To the contrary, Ptolemy believed that musical scales and tunings should in general involve multiple different ratios arranged to fit together evenly into smaller [[tetrachord]]s (combinations of four pitch ratios which together make a [[perfect fourth]]) and [[octave]]s.<ref>

Ptolemy reviewed standard (and [[enharmonic scale|ancient, disused]]) musical tuning practice of his day, which he then compared to his own subdivisions of the [[tetrachord]] and the [[octave]], which he derived experimentally using a [[monochord]] / harmonic canon. The volume ends with a more speculative exposition of the relationships between harmony, the soul (''psyche''), and the planets ([[Musica universalis|harmony of the spheres]]).<ref name=Feke-2012>

Although Ptolemy's ''Harmonics'' never had the influence of his ''Almagest'' or ''Geography'', it is nonetheless a well-structured treatise and contains more methodological reflections than any other of his writings. In particular, it is a nascent form of what in the following millennium developed into the scientific method, with specific descriptions of the experimental apparatus that he built and used to test musical conjectures, and the empirical musical relations he identified by testing pitches against each other: He was able to accurately measure relative pitches based on the ratios of vibrating lengths two separate sides of the same [[monochord|single string]], hence which were assured to be under equal tension, eliminating one source of error. He analyzed the empirically determined ratios of "pleasant" pairs of pitches, and then synthesised all of them into a coherent mathematical description, which persists to the present as [[just intonation]] – the standard for comparison of consonance in the many other, less-than exact but more facile [[meantone temperament|compromise tuning]] systems.<ref>

==Optics==
{{main|Optics (Ptolemy)}}
The ''Optica'' ([[Koine Greek]]: {{math|Ὀπτικά}}), known as the ''Optics,'' is a work that survives only in a somewhat poor Latin version, which, in turn, was translated from a lost Arabic version by [[Eugenius of Palermo]] ({{circa|lk=no|1154}}). In it, Ptolemy writes about properties of sight (not light), including [[reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], and [[colour]]. The work is a significant part of the early [[history of optics]] and influenced the more famous and superior 11th-century ''[[Book of Optics]]'' by [[Ibn al-Haytham]].<ref name=Smith-1996>

</ref> Ptolemy offered explanations for many phenomena concerning illumination and colour, size, shape, movement, and binocular vision. He also divided illusions into those caused by physical or optical factors and those caused by judgmental factors. He offered an obscure explanation of the Sun or [[Moon illusion]] (the enlarged apparent size on the horizon) based on the difficulty of looking upwards.<ref>

Ptolemy's theory of vision consisted of rays (or flux) coming from the eye forming a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer's intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. Size and shape were determined by the visual angle subtended at the eye combined with perceived distance and orientation.<ref name=Smith-1996/><ref>

He wrote a short essay entitled ''On the Criterion and Hegemonikon'' ({{Langx|el|Περὶ Κριτηρίου καὶ Ἡγεμονικοῡ}}), which may have been one of his earliest works. Ptolemy deals specifically with how humans obtain scientific knowledge (i.e., the "criterion" of truth), as well as with the nature and structure of the human ''psyche'' or soul, particularly its ruling faculty (i.e., the ''hegemonikon'').<ref name=Feke-2012/> Ptolemy argues that, to arrive at the truth, one should use both reason and sense perception in ways that complement each other. ''On the Criterion'' is also noteworthy for being the only one of Ptolemy's works that is devoid of [[Greek mathematics|mathematics]].<ref>

Elsewhere, Ptolemy affirms the supremacy of mathematical knowledge over other forms of knowledge. Like Aristotle before him, Ptolemy classifies mathematics as a type of theoretical philosophy; however, Ptolemy believes mathematics to be superior to [[theology]] or [[metaphysics]] because the latter are conjectural while only the former can secure certain knowledge. This view is contrary to the [[Platonism|Platonic]] and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] traditions, where theology or metaphysics occupied the highest honour.<ref name=Feke-2018/> Despite being a minority position among ancient philosophers, Ptolemy's views were shared by other mathematicians such as [[Hero of Alexandria]].<ref>
