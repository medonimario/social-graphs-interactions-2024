== Life ==
He was born in Harima Province (now Miki City, Hyogo Prefecture) on February 8, 1561 to the [[Reizei family]]. At the age of seven or eight he was sent to the [[Shōkoku-ji]] temple to become a [[Zen|Zen Buddhist]] priest. There, he studied [[Confucianism]] alongside his Zen studies. In 1596, Fujiwara attempted to travel to [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] in order to study under an authentic Confucian master, but inclement weather forced the party to turn back. Fujiwara learned more about [[Neo-Confucianism]] from the Korean scholar [[Kang Hang]]. <ref>{{Cite web |last=Yu |first=A.
