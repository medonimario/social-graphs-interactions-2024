==Biography==
Gáspár Miklós Tamás was born in today's [[Cluj]], Romania, but emigrated to [[Budapest]], Hungary, in 1978, where he lived for much of his life. His mother was Jewish and escaped being deported to Auschwitz because she was imprisoned for being a communist.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.criticatac.ro/lefteast/words-from-budapest-2/|title = Words from Budapest.

While in contact with libertarian authors, his perspective was distinct from the [[Budapest School (Lukács)|Budapest School]], a major [[school of thought]] in Hungarian [[Neo-Marxism]]. He was also a member of the informal group called the "[[Democratic opposition (Hungary)|democratic opposition]]". From 1986 to 1988, he taught in the U.S., Britain, and France, and also continued his studies at [[Oxford University]]. At the beginning of the [[Post-communism|post-socialist]] era in 1989, he became committed to a liberal program, and was a leader of the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ).<ref>{{cite news |title=UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST; A Democratically Evolving Hungary Heads Into Unknown at Polls Today |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/25/world/upheaval-east-democratically-evolving-hungary-heads-into-unknown-polls-today.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 15, 2008 |first=Celestine |last=Bohlen |date=March 25, 1990 |archive-date=3 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903174306/https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/25/world/upheaval-east-democratically-evolving-hungary-heads-into-unknown-polls-today.html?pagewanted=all |url-status=live }}</ref> As a representative of the party, he was a member of the [[Hungarian Parliament]] from 1989 to 1994,<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Jäger |first1=Anton |title=The prophet of post-fascism |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=2023-01-17 |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2023/01/gaspar-miklos-tamas-prophet-post-fascism |language=en-US |access-date=2024-05-06 |archive-date=7 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230607170127/https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2023/01/gaspar-miklos-tamas-prophet-post-fascism |url-status=live }}</ref> and served the party's president through 1994, departing the party in 2000.

Tamás was known for developing the concept of [[post-fascism]]{{r|Arbetet}} and the term [[ethnicism]]. In his words, {{cquote|Post-fascism finds its niche easily in the new world of global capitalism without upsetting the dominant political forms of electoral democracy and representative government. It does what I consider to be central to all varieties of fascism, including the post-totalitarian version. Sans Führer, sans one-party rule, sans SA or SS, post-fascism reverses the Enlightenment tendency to assimilate citizenship to the human condition.}}

Tamás died on 15 January 2023, at the age of 74.<ref>{{cite news |title=Meghalt Tamás Gáspár Miklós |url=https://index.hu/belfold/2023/01/15/tamas-gaspar-miklos-tgm-meghalt-gyasz-nekrolog/ |access-date=15 January 2023 |publisher=Index.hu |date=15 January 2023 |archive-date=15 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230115145725/https://index.hu/belfold/2023/01/15/tamas-gaspar-miklos-tgm-meghalt-gyasz-nekrolog/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
