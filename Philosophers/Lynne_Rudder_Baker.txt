Born in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] in 1944 to Virginia Bennett and James Rudder, she earned her Ph.D. in 1972 from [[Vanderbilt University]] after beginning her graduate studies at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1967. She was a fellow of the [[National Humanities Center]] (1983–1984)<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/fellow/lynne-rudder-baker-1983-1984/ | title=Lynne Rudder Baker, 1983–1984 }}</ref> and the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] (1988–1989).{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

She joined the faculty of UMass Amherst in 1989. She is the author of several books, notably ''Saving Belief: A Critique of [[Physicalism]]'' (1987), ''Explaining Attitudes: A Practical Approach to the Mind'' (1995), ''Persons and Bodies: A Constitution View'' (2000), and ''The Metaphysics of Everyday Life: An Essay in Practical Realism'' (2007).{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Along with several other scholars, Baker delivered the 2001 [[Gifford Lectures]] in Natural Theology at the [[University of Glasgow]], published as ''The Nature and Limits of Human Understanding'' (ed.

==Views on science and religion==
Baker imputes to scientists generally the view that human beings are just another species rather than a [[special creation]] of [[God]]:
<blockquote>Yet, the sciences are relentless in taking human beings to be just another part of nature: a little more complex than chimpanzees, but not essentially different—certainly not morally and ontologically special. We are just one species among many."<ref>[http://people.umass.edu/lrb/files/bak08ourM.pdf Our Place in Nature: Material Persons and Theism]</ref></blockquote>
