'''Gregory of Nazianzus''' ({{langx|el|Γρηγόριος ὁ Ναζιανζηνός|Grēgorios ho Nazianzēnos}}; {{circa|329}}<ref name="ReferenceA">''Liturgy of the Hours'' Volume I, Proper of Saints, 2 January.</ref> – 25 January 390),<ref name="ReferenceA" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saint.gr/1161/saint.aspx |title=Ορθόδοξος Συναξαριστής :: Άγιος Γρηγόριος ο Θεολόγος |website=Saint.gr |date=25 January 2016 |access-date=1 November 2016}}</ref> also known as '''Gregory the Theologian''' or '''Gregory Nazianzen''', was an early [[Christianity as the Roman state religion|Roman Christian]] theologian and prelate who served as [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Archbishop of Constantinople]] from 380 to 381. He is widely considered the most accomplished rhetorical stylist of the [[Church Fathers|patristic age]].<ref name="McGuckin">McGuckin, John (2001) ''Saint Gregory of Nazianzus: An Intellectual Biography'', Crestwood, NY.</ref> As a classically trained orator and philosopher, he infused [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]] into the [[Early Christianity|early Church]], establishing the paradigm of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] theologians and church officials.<ref name="McGuckin" />

Gregory made a significant impact on the shape of [[Trinitarian]] theology among both Greek and [[Latin]]-speaking theologians, and he is remembered as the "Trinitarian Theologian". Much of his theological work continues to influence modern theologians, especially in regard to the relationship among the three Persons of the Trinity. Along with the brothers [[Basil the Great]] and [[Gregory of Nyssa]], he is known as one of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]].

Gregory of Nazianzus is a [[saint]] in both [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity]]. In the [[Catholic Church]] he is numbered among the [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]]; in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] he is revered as one of the [[Three Holy Hierarchs]], along with Basil the Great and [[John Chrysostom]]. He is considered one of the [[Church Fathers#Great Fathers|Great Fathers]] in both Eastern and Western Christianity. He was considered the patron saint of [[Kotromanić dynasty]] and medieval [[Bosnia]] during the first half of the 15th century, while [[Saint George]], the miracle-worker, has been the patron saint since at least mid-13th century, although confirmed by the papacy much later in 1461. [[Pope Gregory I|Saint Gregory the Great]] was also considered the patron of both the state and dynasty in the late 15th century.<ref name="Zbornik-Lovrenović-2008-Sv.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Gregory was born to [[Cappadocian Greeks|Greek]] parents<ref name=" The Riverside Dictionary of Biography 336 ">{{cite book |title=The Riverside Dictionary of Biography |year=2005 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=9780618493371 |quote=Gregory of Nazianzus or Nazianzen, St c. 330-c. 389 AD •Greek prelate and theologian- Born of Greek parents in Cappadocia, he was educated in Caesarea, Alexandria and Athens. |page=[https://archive.org/details/riversidediction0000unse/page/336 336] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/riversidediction0000unse/page/336 }}</ref> in the family estate of [[Karbala (Cappadocia)|Karbala]] outside the village of [[Arianzus]], near [[Nazianzus]], in southwest [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]].<ref name = "Ruether">{{citation |author-link=Rosemary Radford Ruether |last=Ruether |first=Rosemary Radford |title=Gregory of Nazianzus: Rhetor and Philosopher |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1969}}</ref>{{rp |18}} His parents, [[Gregory of Nazianzus the Elder|Gregory]] and [[Nonna of Nazianzus|Nonna]], were wealthy land-owners. In [[Anno Domini|AD]]&nbsp;325, Nonna converted her husband, a [[Hypsistarian]], to Christianity; he was subsequently ordained as bishop of Nazianzus in 328 or 329.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |vii}} The young Gregory and his brother, [[Caesarius of Nazianzus|Caesarius]], first studied at home with their uncle Amphylokhios. Gregory went on to study advanced rhetoric and philosophy in Nazianzus, [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]], [[Alexandria]], and [[Athens]]. On the way to Athens his ship encountered a violent storm, and the terrified Gregory prayed to Christ that if He would deliver him, he would dedicate his life to His service.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |28}} While at Athens, he developed a close friendship with his fellow student [[Basil of Caesarea]], and also made the acquaintance of Flavius Claudius Julianus, who would later become the emperor known as [[Julian the Apostate]].<ref name = "Ruether" />{{rp |19,25}} In Athens, Gregory studied under the famous rhetoricians [[Himerius]] and [[Proaeresius]].<ref name = "Hunter-Blair">{{citation |last=Hunter-Blair |first=DO |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |contribution=Gregory of Nazianzus |publisher=Robert Appleton |year=1910}}</ref> He may have been baptized there, or shortly after his return to Cappadocia.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZuC9BGZFRwC |first=Brian |last=Daley |title=Gregory of Nazianzus |series=The Early Church Fathers |publisher=Routledge |year=2012 |isbn=9781134807277 |pages=7–9}}</ref>

===Priesthood===
In 361, Gregory returned to [[Nazianzus]] and was ordained a [[presbyter]] by his father's wish, who wanted him to assist with caring for local Christians.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |99–102}} The younger Gregory, who had been considering a monastic existence, resented his father's decision to force him to choose between priestly services and a solitary existence, calling it an "act of tyranny".<ref name = "Ruether" />{{rp |32}}<ref>Migne, J.P. (ed), ''[[Patrologia Graeca|Patrologiae Graecae (PG)]]'', (1857–66), 37.1053, ''Carm. de vita sua'', l.345</ref> Leaving home after a few days, he met his friend Basil at Annesoi, where the two lived as ascetics.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |102}} However, Basil urged him to return home to assist his father, which he did for the next year. Arriving at [[Nazianzus]], Gregory found the local Christian community split by theological differences and his father accused of heresy by local monks.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |107}} Gregory helped to heal the division through a combination of personal diplomacy and oratory.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

By this time, Emperor Julian had publicly declared himself in opposition to Christianity.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |115}} In response to the emperor's rejection of the Christian faith, Gregory composed his ''Invectives Against Julian'' between 362 and 363. ''Invectives'' asserts that Christianity will overcome imperfect rulers such as Julian through love and patience. This process as described by Gregory is the public manifestation of the process of deification (''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]''), which leads to a spiritual elevation and mystical union with God.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |121}} Julian resolved, in late 362, to vigorously prosecute Gregory and his other Christian critics; however, the emperor perished the following year during a campaign against the Persians.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |125–6}} With the death of the emperor, Gregory and the Eastern churches were no longer under the threat of persecution, as the new emperor [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] was an avowed Christian and supporter of the church.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |130}}

Gregory spent the next few years combating [[Arianism]], which threatened to divide the region of [[Cappadocia]]. In this tense environment, Gregory interceded on behalf of his friend Basil with Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea ([[Caesarea Mazaca|Mazaca]]).<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |138–42}} The two friends then entered a period of close fraternal cooperation as they participated in a great rhetorical contest of the Caesarean church precipitated by the arrival of accomplished Arian theologians and rhetors.<ref name="McGuckin" />{{rp |143}} In the subsequent public debates, presided over by agents of the Emperor [[Valens]], Gregory and Basil emerged triumphant. This success confirmed for both Gregory and Basil that their futures lay in administration of the Church.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |143}} Basil, who had long displayed inclinations to the episcopacy, was elected bishop of the see of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea in Cappadocia]] in 370.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

===Episcopate in Sasima and Nazianzus===
Gregory was ordained Bishop of [[Sasima]] in 372 by Basil.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |190–5}} Basil created this [[Episcopal see|see]] in order to strengthen his position in his dispute with [[Anthimus of Tyana|Anthimus]], bishop of [[Tyana]].<ref name = "Hunter-Blair" /> The ambitions of Gregory's father to have his son rise in the Church hierarchy and the insistence of his friend Basil convinced Gregory to accept this position despite his reservations. Gregory would later refer to his episcopal ordination as forced upon him by his strong-willed father and Basil.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |187–92}} Describing his new bishopric, Gregory lamented how it was nothing more than an "utterly dreadful, pokey little hole; a paltry horse-stop on the main road&nbsp;... devoid of water, vegetation, or the company of gentlemen&nbsp;... this was my Church of Sasima!"<ref>Gregory, as quoted in ''[[Patrologia Graeca|PG]]'' 37.1059–60, ''De Vita Sua'', vv. 439–46.</ref> He made little effort to administer his new diocese, complaining to Basil that he preferred instead to pursue a contemplative life.<ref name = "Ruether" />{{rp |38–9}}

By late 372, Gregory returned to Nazianzus to assist his dying father with the administration of his diocese.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |199}} This strained his relationship with Basil, who insisted that Gregory resume his post at Sasima. Gregory retorted that he had no intention to continue to play the role of pawn to advance Basil's interests.<ref>{{citation |last=Gallay |first=P. |title=Grégoire de Nazianze |place=Paris |year=1964 |language=fr |page=61}}; quoting from Ep. 48, PG 37.97.</ref> He instead focused his attention on his new duties as [[Coadjutor bishop|coadjutor]] of Nazianzus.

It was around this time that his sister, [[Saint Gorgonia]], died, and he preached a eulogy at her funeral.

Following the deaths of his mother and father in 374, Gregory continued to administer the Diocese of Nazianzus but refused to be named bishop. Donating most of his inheritance to the needy, he lived an austere existence.<ref name = "Hunter-Blair" /> At the end of 375, he withdrew to a monastery at [[Silifke|Seleukia]], living there for three years. Near the end of this period his friend Basil died. Although Gregory's health did not permit him to attend the funeral, he wrote a heartfelt letter of condolence to Basil's brother, [[Gregory of Nyssa]], and composed twelve memorial poems dedicated to the memory of his departed friend. (The Greek Anthology, book I epigram 86 and book VIII epigrams 2–11).

===Gregory at Constantinople===
Upon the death of Emperor Valens in 378, the accession of [[Theodosius I]], a steadfast supporter of Nicene orthodoxy, was good news to those who wished to purge Constantinople of [[Arianism|Arian]] and [[Apollinarism|Apollinarian]] domination.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |235}} The exiled Nicene party gradually returned to the city. From his deathbed, Basil reminded them of Gregory's capabilities and likely recommended his friend to champion the Trinitarian cause in Constantinople.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |235–6}}<ref>Orat. 43.2, PG 36.497.</ref>

In 379, the Antioch synod and its archbishop, Meletios, asked Gregory to go to Constantinople to lead a theological campaign to win over that city to Nicene orthodoxy.<ref name = "Ruether" />{{rp |42}} After much hesitation, Gregory agreed. His cousin Theodosia offered him a villa for his residence; Gregory immediately transformed much of it into a church, naming it Anastasia, "a scene for the resurrection of the faith".<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |241}}<ref>2 Kings 4:8 and Orat. 26.17, PG 35.1249.</ref> From this little chapel he delivered five powerful discourses on Nicene doctrine, explaining the nature of the Trinity and the unity of the Godhead.<ref name = "Hunter-Blair" /> Refuting the [[Anomoeanism|Eunomian]] denial of the Holy Spirit's divinity, Gregory offered this argument:

{{blockquote |Look at these facts: Christ is born, the Holy Spirit is His Forerunner. Christ is baptized, the Spirit bears witness to this&nbsp;... Christ works miracles, the Spirit accompanies them. Christ ascends, the Spirit takes His place. What great things are there in the idea of God which are not in His power? What titles appertaining to God do not apply also to Him, except for Unbegotten and Begotten? I tremble when I think of such an abundance of titles, and how many Names they blaspheme, those who revolt against the Spirit!<ref>{{citation |last=Nazianzus |first=Gregory of |title=Or |page=31:29 |publisher=The Orthodox Church of America |access-date=May 2, 2007 |url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&ID=1&FSID=100298}}</ref>}}

Gregory's homilies were well received and attracted ever-growing crowds to Anastasia. Fearing his popularity, his opponents decided to strike. On the [[Easter Eve|vigil of Easter]] in 379, an Arian mob burst into his church during worship services, wounding Gregory and killing another bishop. Escaping the mob, Gregory next found himself betrayed by his erstwhile friend, the philosopher [[Maximus I of Constantinople|Maximus the Cynic]]. Maximus, who was in secret alliance with Peter, bishop of Alexandria, attempted to seize Gregory's position and have himself ordained bishop of Constantinople.<ref name="Ruether" />{{rp |43}} Shocked, Gregory decided to resign his office, but the faction faithful to him induced him to stay and ejected Maximus. This episode left Gregory embarrassed, and exposed him to criticism as a provincial simpleton unable to cope with the intrigues of the imperial city.<ref name="Ruether" />{{rp |43}}

Affairs in Constantinople remained confused as Gregory's position was still unofficial, and Arian priests yet occupied many important churches. The arrival of the emperor Theodosius in 380 settled matters in Gregory's favor. The emperor, determined to eliminate Arianism, expelled [[Demophilus of Constantinople|Bishop Demophilus]]. Gregory was subsequently enthroned as bishop of Constantinople at the Basilica of the Apostles, replacing Demophilus.<ref name = "Ruether" />{{rp |45}}

===Second Ecumenical Council and retirement to Nazianzus===
[[Image:3HolyHierarchs.jpg|thumb|left|A Byzantine-style icon depicting the [[Three Holy Hierarchs]]: ''(left to right:)'' [[Basil the Great]], [[John Chrysostom]] and Gregory the Theologian.]]
Theodosius wanted to further unify the entire empire behind the orthodox position and decided to convene a church council to resolve matters of faith and discipline.<ref name="Ruether" />{{rp |45}} Gregory was of similar mind in wishing to unify Christianity. In the spring of 381 they convened the [[First Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council]] in Constantinople, which was attended by 150 Eastern bishops. After the death of the presiding bishop, [[Meletius of Antioch]], Gregory was selected to lead the council. Hoping to reconcile the West with the East, he offered to recognize [[Paulinus, Bishop of Antioch|Paulinus]] as Patriarch of Antioch. The Egyptian and Macedonian bishops who had supported Maximus's ordination arrived late for the council. Once there, they refused to recognise Gregory's position as head of the church of Constantinople, arguing that his transfer from the See of Sasima was canonically illegitimate.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |358–9}}

Gregory was physically exhausted and worried that he was losing the confidence of the bishops and the emperor.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |359}} Rather than press his case and risk further division, he decided to resign his office: "Let me be as the Prophet Jonah! I was responsible for the storm, but I would sacrifice myself for the salvation of the ship. Seize me and throw me&nbsp;... I was not happy when I ascended the throne, and gladly would I descend it."<ref>''[[Patrologia Graeca|PG]]'', 37.1157–9, ''Carm. de vita sua'', ll 1828–55.</ref> He shocked the council with his surprise resignation and then delivered a dramatic speech to Theodosius asking to be released from his offices. The emperor, moved by his words, applauded, commended his labor, and granted his resignation. The Council asked him to appear once more for a farewell ritual and celebratory orations. Gregory used this occasion to deliver a final address ({{abbreviation|Or.|Oration}} 42) and then departed.<ref name = "McGuckin" />{{rp |361}}

Returning to his homeland of Cappadocia, Gregory once again resumed his position as bishop of Nazianzus. He spent the next year combating the local Apollinarian heretics and struggling with periodic illness. He also began composing ''De Vita Sua'', his autobiographical poem.<ref name = "Ruether" />{{rp |50}} By the end of 383 he found his health too feeble to cope with episcopal duties. Gregory established Eulalius as bishop of Nazianzus and then withdrew into the solitude of Arianzum. After enjoying six peaceful years in retirement at his family estate, he died on 25 January in 390.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Gregory faced stark choices throughout his life: Should he pursue studies as a rhetor or philosopher? Would a monastic life be more appropriate than public ministry? Was it better to blaze his own path or follow the course mapped for him by his father and Basil? Gregory's writings illuminate the conflicts which both tormented and motivated him. Biographers suggest that it was this dialectic which defined him, forged his character, and inspired his search for meaning and truth.<ref name = "Ruether" />{{rp |54}}

===Theological and other works===
<!-- As of 2024-05-18, ''[[Poemata Arcana]]'' redirects here. Please update this redirect if changing the section title.-->
Gregory's most significant theological contributions arose from his defense of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. He is especially noted for his contributions to the field of [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|pneumatology]]—that is, theology concerning the nature of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref>Michael O'Carroll, "Gregory of Nazianzus" in ''Trinitas'' (Wilmington, DE: Michael Glazier, 1987).</ref> In this regard, Gregory is the first to use the idea of ''procession'' to describe the relationship between the Spirit and the Godhead: "The Holy Spirit is truly Spirit, coming forth from the Father indeed but not after the manner of the Son, for it is not by generation but by ''procession'', since I must coin a word for the sake of clearness."<ref>Gregory of Nazianzus, ''Five Theological Orations'', oration five. This fifth oration deals entirely with the Holy Spirit.</ref> Although Gregory does not fully develop the concept, the idea of procession would shape most later thought about the Holy Spirit.<ref>HEW Turner and Francis Young, "Procession(s)" in ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'', ed. A. Richardson & J. Bowden (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1983). Through Augustine, the idea would develop in the West into "double-procession", resulting in the ''[[Filioque clause]]'' and the split between Eastern and Western Christianity.</ref>

He emphasized that Jesus did not cease to be God when he became a man, nor did he lose any of his divine attributes when he took on human nature. Furthermore, Gregory asserted that Christ was fully human, including a full human soul. He also proclaimed the eternality of the Holy Spirit, saying that the Holy Spirit's actions were somewhat hidden in the [[Old Testament]] but much clearer since the ascension of Jesus into Heaven and the descent of the Holy Spirit at the feast of Pentecost.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meinel|first=Fabian|date=2009|title=Gregory of Nazianzus' ''Poemata Arcana'': ἄρρητα and Christian Persuasion|journal=The Cambridge Classical Journal|volume=55|pages=71–96|doi=10.1017/S1750270500000208|jstor=44688044|s2cid=170730880|issn=1750-2705}}</ref>

In contrast to the Neo-Arian belief that the Son is ''anomoios'', or "unlike" the Father, and with the [[Semi-Arian]] assertion that the Son is {{transl|grc|[[homoiousios]]}}, or "like" the Father, Gregory and his fellow Cappadocians maintained the Nicaean doctrine of {{lang|grc|[[Homoousian|homoousia]]}}, or [[consubstantiality]] of the Son with the Father.<ref name = "Børtnes">{{citation |last=Børtnes |year=2006|title=Gregory of Nazianzus: Images and Reflections}}</ref>{{rp |9,10}} The Cappadocian Fathers asserted that God's nature is unknowable to man; helped to develop the framework of {{transl|grc|[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]]}}, or three persons united in a single Godhead; illustrated how Jesus is the {{transl|grc|[[icon|eikon]]}} of the Father; and explained the concept of {{transl|grc|[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]}}, the belief that all Christians can be assimilated with God in "imitation of the incarnate Son as the divine model."<ref name = "Børtnes" />{{rp |10}}

Some of Gregory's theological writings suggest that, like his friend [[Gregory of Nyssa]], he may have supported some form of the doctrine of [[apocatastasis]], the belief that God will bring all of creation into harmony with the Kingdom of Heaven.<ref>"[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc01.html?term=Apocatastasis Apocatastasis]". ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. I''.</ref> This led [[Philip Schaff]] and late-nineteenth century [[Universal reconciliation|Christian universalists]] such as [[J. W. Hanson]] to describe Gregory's theology as universalist.<ref>Hanson, JW ''Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine Of The Christian Church During Its First Five Hundred Years.'' [http://www.tentmaker.org/books/Prevailing.html#211 Chapter XV: Gregory Nazianzen]. Boston and Chicago Universalist Publishing House, 1899.</ref> This view of Gregory is also held by some modern theologians such as John Sachs, who said that Gregory had "leanings" toward apocatastasis, but in a "cautious, undogmatic" way.<ref>Sachs, John R. "Apocatastasis in Patristic Theology." Theological Studies. 54 (December 1993), p. 632.</ref> However, it is not clear or universally accepted that Gregory held to the doctrine of apocatastasis.<ref>David L. Balas, "Apokatastasis" in ''The Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', second edition, ed. Everett Ferguson (New York: Garland Publishing, 1997), details [[Gregory of Nyssa]]'s adherence to the doctrine, while making no mention of Nazianzan.</ref>

Apart from the several theological discourses, Gregory was also one of the most important early Christian men of letters, a very accomplished orator, even perhaps one of the greatest of his time.<ref name = "Børtnes" />{{rp |21}} Gregory was also a very prolific poet who wrote theological, moral, and biographical poems.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The book VIII of the ''Greek Anthology'' contains exclusively 254 epigrams of his.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

===Influence===
Gregory's great nephew Nichobulos served as his literary executor, preserving and editing many of his writings. A cousin, Eulalios, published several of Gregory's more noteworthy works in 391.<ref name="McGuckin" />{{rp |xi}} By 400, Rufinius began translating his orations into Latin. As Gregory's works circulated throughout the empire they influenced theological thought. His orations were cited as authoritative by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431. By 451 he was designated ''Theologus'', or ''Theologian'' by the [[Council of Chalcedon]]<ref name="McGuckin" />{{rp |xi}} – a title held by no others save [[John the Apostle]]<ref name = "Hunter-Blair" /> and [[Symeon the New Theologian]] (949–1022 AD). He is widely quoted by Eastern Orthodox theologians and highly regarded as a defender of the Christian faith.

===Relics===
Following his death, Gregory was buried at Nazianzus. His relics, consisting of portions of his body and clothing, were transferred to [[Constantinople]] in 950, into the Church of the Holy Apostles. Part of the relics were taken from Constantinople by [[Crusade]]rs during the [[Fourth Crusade]], in 1204, and ended up in [[Rome]]. On 27 November 2004, those relics, along with those of [[John Chrysostom]], were returned to Constantinople (now [[Istanbul]]) by [[Pope John Paul II]], with the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] retaining a small portion of both. The relics are now enshrined in the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Patriarchal]] [[Church of St. George, Istanbul|Cathedral of St. George]] in the [[Fener|Fanar]].<ref>{{citation|first=Ian |last=Fisher |contribution=Pope returns remains of 2 Orthodox patriarchs |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041128/news_1n28pope.html |title=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=28 November 2004 |access-date=24 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829143756/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041128/news_1n28pope.html |archive-date=29 August 2007 }}</ref>

===Death===
During the six years of life which remained to him after his final retirement to his birthplace, Gregory composed the greater part of his copious poetical works. These include a valuable autobiographical poem of nearly 2,000 lines; about one hundred other shorter poems relating to his past career; and a large number of epitaphs, epigrams, and epistles to well-known people during that era. The poems that he wrote that dealt with his personal affairs refer to the continuous illness and severe sufferings (physical and spiritual) which assailed him during his last years. In the tiny plot of ground at [[Arianzus]], all that remained to him of his rich inheritance was by a fountain near which there was a shady walk. Gregory retired here to spend his days as a hermit. It was during this time that he decided to write theological discourses and poetry of both a religious and an autobiographical nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-gregory-of-nazianzen/|title=Saint Gregory of Nazianzen|date=3 January 2009}}</ref> He would receive occasional visits from intimate friends, as well as visits from strangers who were attracted to his retreat by his large reputation for sanctity and learning. He died about 25 January 390, although the exact date of his death is unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07010b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Gregory of Nazianzus|website=Newadvent.org|access-date=1 November 2016}}</ref>
