{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Kumarila Bhatta''' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: Kumārila Bhaṭṭa; [[floruit|fl.]] roughly 7th century CE) was a [[Hindu]] philosopher and a scholar of [[Mimamsa]] school of philosophy from early [[medieval India]]. He is famous for many of his various theses on Mimamsa, such as ''Mimamsaslokavarttika''. Bhaṭṭa was a staunch believer in the supreme validity of Vedic injunction, a champion of Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā and a confirmed ritualist.{{sfn|Sharma|1980|p=5–6}} The ''Varttika'' is mainly written as a subcommentary of Sabara's commentary on Jaimini's [[Purva Mimamsa Sutras]]. His philosophy is classified by some scholars as existential realism.<ref>Bhatt, p. 6.</ref>

Scholars differ as regards Kumārila Bhaṭṭa's views on a [[personal God]]. For example, Manikka Vachakar believed that Bhaṭṭa promoted a personal God<ref>''A History of Indian Philosophy'' By Surendranath Dasgupta. p. 156.</ref> ([[saguna brahman]]), which conflicts with the Mīmāṃsā school. In his ''Varttika'', Kumārila Bhaṭṭa goes to great lengths to argue against the theory of a creator God<ref>Bales, p. 198.</ref> and held that the actions enjoined in the Veda had definite results without an external interference of Deity.

Kumārila is also credited with the logical formulation of the Mimamsic belief that the Vedas are unauthored ([[apauruṣeyā]]). In particular, he is known for his defense of Vedic ritualism against medieval [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] idealism.{{sfn|Sheridan|1995|p=200}} His work strongly influenced other schools of Indian philosophy,<ref>Bhatt, p. 3.</ref> with the exception that while Mimamsa considers the Upanishads to be subservient to the Vedas, the Vedanta school does not think so.

== Early life ==

The birthplace of Kumārila Bhatta is uncertain. According to the 16th-century Buddhist scholar [[Taranatha]], Kumārila was a native of [[South India]]. However, Anandagiri's ''Shankara-Vijaya'' states that Kumarila came from "the North" (''udagdeśāt''), and debated the Buddhists and the Jains in the South.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Kumārila Bhaṭṭa |author2=Peri Sarveswara Sharma |title=Anthology of Kumārilabhaṭṭa's Works |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW5weaXy2jUC&pg=PA11 |year=1980 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2084-5 |page=11 }}</ref>

Another theory is that he came from eastern India, specifically [[Kamarupa]] (present-day [[Assam]]). Sesa's ''Sarvasiddhanta-rahasya'' uses the eastern title [[Bhattacharya (surname)|Bhattacharya]] for him. His writings indicate that he was familiar with the production of [[Assam silk|silk]], which was common in present-day Assam.<ref>{{cite book |author=Biswanarayan Shastri |title=Mīmāṁsā philosophy & Kumārila Bhaṭṭa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6TWAAAAMAAJ |year=1995 |publisher=Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan |page=76 }}</ref> Yet another theory is that he comes from [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]], which has similar culture to  Assam, and produced another scholar on the subject [[Mandana Misra]]. According to legend in Mithila, the [[Kumarila Bhatta Dih]] at ''Bhatsimar'' or ''Bhatpura'' in the [[Mithila (region)|Mithila region]] is believed to be the birthplace of Kumarila Bhatta.<ref>{{Cite web |title=कुमारिल भट्ट डीह को मिलेगा पर्यटन केंद्र का दर्जा - Kumaril Bhatt Dih will get tourism center status - Bihar Madhubani General News |url=https://www.jagran.com/bihar/madhubani-kumaril-bhatt-dih-will-get-tourism-center-status-19846807.html |access-date=2024-07-12 |website=Jagran |language=hi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=दर्शन शास्त्र की जननी है मिथिला - |url=https://www.jagran.com/bihar/darbhanga-12917529.html |access-date=2024-07-12 |website=Jagran |language=hi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-03 |title=सनातन धर्म के सच्चे सिपाही थे दार्शनिक कुमारिल भट्ट, तीन ग्रंथों के थे रचयिता |url=https://hindi.news18.com/news/dharm/philosopher-kumaril-bhatt-was-a-true-soldier-of-sanatan-dharma-due-to-a-mistake-he-set-himself-on-fire-8461003.html |access-date=2024-07-12 |website=News18 हिंदी |language=hi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=कुमारिल भट्ट भटपुरा से महिषी तक निकलेगी रथ यात्रा |url=https://www.bhaskar.com/bihar/darbhanga/news/rath-yatra-will-come-from-kumaril-bhatt-bhatpura-to-mahishi-215504-5294563.html |work=[[Dainik Bhaskar]]}}</ref>

==Linguistics views==
Kumārila Bhaṭṭa and his followers in the Mīmāṃsā tradition known as ''{{IAST|Bhāṭṭas}}'' argued for a strongly [[Principle of compositionality|Compositional]] view of semantics called ''abhihitānvaya'' or "designation of what has been denoted." In this view, the meaning of a sentence was understood only after understanding first the meanings of individual words.  Word referents were independent, complete objects, a view that is close to the [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]]ian view of language, according to philosopher Daniel Arnold.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arnold |first1=Daniel |title=Buddhists, Brahmins, and Belief: Epistemology in South Asian Philosophy of Religion |date=2005 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York}}</ref> He also used several [[Tamil language|Tamil]] words in his works, including one of the earliest mention of the name ''Dravida'' in North Indian sources, found in his ''Tantravārttika''.<ref>http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam041/2003282070.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>

The above-mentioned view of sentence meaning was debated over some seven or eight centuries by the followers of the [[Prabhākara]] school within Mīmāṃsā, who argued that words do not directly designate meaning. Rather, word meanings are understood as already connected with other words (''anvitābhidhāna'', anvita = connected; abhidhāna = denotation).  This view was influenced by the [[holism|holistic]] arguments of [[Bhartṛhari]]'s {{IAST|[[sphoṭa]]}} theory.<ref name=":0" /> Essentially the Prābhākaras argued that sentence meanings are grasped directly, from perceptual and contextual cues, skipping the stage of grasping singly the individual word meanings,<ref name=Matilal>Matilal, p. 108.</ref> similar to the modern view of linguistic [[underspecification]], which relates to the [[Semantics#Dynamic turn in semantics|Dynamic Turn in Semantics]], that also opposes purely compositional approaches to sentence meaning.

== Epistemological views ==
In his text Slokavarttika, Kumārila Bhatta argues that cognitions are intrinsically valid (''svatah pramanya''):<ref name=":0">{{Citation |last=Arnold |first=Daniel |title=Kumārila |date=2020 |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2020/entries/kumaarila/ |access-date=2024-02-07 |edition=Spring 2020 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref>
{{Quote|text=It should be understood that all pramanas' have the property of being pramanas intrinsically; for a capacity not already existing by itself (svatah) cannot be produced by anything else.}}Kumārila argues against the need for second-order justification before accepting cognitions as valid.<ref name=":0" />

==Defense against Buddhism==
Kumārila Bhaṭṭa is known for his defense of Vedic ritualism against medieval [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] idealism.{{sfn|Sheridan|1995|p=200}} With the aim to prove the superiority of Vedic scripture, Kumārila Bhaṭṭa presented several novel arguments:

1. ''"Buddhist (or Jain) scripture could not be correct because it had several grammatical lapses."'' He specifically takes the Buddhist verse: 'ime samkhada dhamma sambhavanti sakarana akarana vinassanti' (These phenomena arise when the cause is present and perish when the cause is absent). Thus he presents his argument:<ref name=Pollock>Pollock, p. 55.</ref>
{{blockquote|The scriptures of Buddhists and Jains are composed in overwhelmingly incorrect (asadhu) language, words of the Magadha or Dakshinatya languages, or even their dialects (tadopabhramsa). Therefore false compositions (asannibandhana), they cannot possibly be true knowledge (shastra)&nbsp;... By contrast, the very form itself (the well-assembled language) of the Veda proves its authority to be independent and absolute.}}

2. Every extant school held some scripture to be correct. To show that the Veda was the only correct scripture, Kumārila said that ''"the absence of an author would safeguard the Veda against all reproach"'' ([[apaurusheya]]).<ref name=Varttika>Jha, p. 31.</ref> There was ''"no way to prove any of the contents of Buddhist scriptures directly as wrong in spirit..."'', unless one challenges the legitimacy and eternal nature of the scripture itself. It is well known that the [[Pali Canon]] was composed after the [[Buddha]]'s [[parinirvana]]. Further, even if they were the Buddha's words, they were not eternal or unauthored like the Vedas.

3. The [[Sautrantika]] Buddhist school believed that the universe was momentary (kshanika). Kumārila said that this was absurd, given that the universe does not disappear every moment. No matter how small one would define the duration of a moment, one could divide the moment into infinitely further parts. Kumārila argues: ''"if the universe does not exist between moments, then in which of these moments does it exist?"'' Because a moment could be infinitesimally small, Bhaṭṭa argued that the Buddhist was claiming that the universe was non-existent.

4. The Determination of perception (pratyaksha pariccheda).<ref name=Taber>Taber, p??</ref>

Some scholars believe that Kumārila's understanding of [[Buddhist philosophy]] was far greater than that of any other non-Buddhist philosopher of his time.<ref name=Rani>Rani, p??</ref> However, see Taber 2010 for an alternate view.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Taber |first1=John |title=Kumārila's Buddhist |journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy |date=2010 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=279–296|doi=10.1007/s10781-010-9093-9 |s2cid=170490847 }}</ref>

According to [[Buton Rinchen Drub]], Kumārila spoke abusively towards his nephew, [[Dharmakīrti]], as he was taking his brahminical garments. This drove Dharmakīrti away, and resolving to vanquish all non-Buddhist heretics he took the robes of the Buddhist order instead.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Buton|first1=Rinchen drub|title=The History of Buddhism in India and Tibet|date=1931|translator=E. Obermiller|publisher=Harrossowitz|location=Heidelberg|page=152}}</ref>

==Legendary life==
According to legend, Kumārila went to study [[Buddhism]] at [[Nalanda]] (the largest 4th-century university in the world), with the aim of refuting Buddhist doctrine in favour of [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]].{{sfn|Long|2011|p=175}} He was expelled from the university when he protested against his teacher ([[Dharmakirti]]) ridiculing the Vedic rituals. Legend has it that even though he was thrown off of the university's tower, he survived with an eye injury by claiming "if the Vedas are the ultimate then I will be spared from Death". Modern Mimamsa scholars and followers of Vedanta believe that this was because he imposed a condition on the infallibility of the Vedas thus encouraging the Hindu belief that one should not even doubt the infallibility of the Vedas.

The ''Madhaviya Sankara Digvijayam'', a 14th-century hagiographic work on the life of [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]], claims that Sankara challenged Bhaṭṭa to a debate on his deathbed.<ref>'Madhaviya Sankara Digvijayam' by medieval Vijayanagara biographer Madhava, Sringeri Sharada Press</ref> Kumārila Bhaṭṭa could not debate Sankara  as he was punishing himself to have disrespected his Buddhist teacher by defeating him in a debate using the Vedas by self-immolation at the banks of [[Narmada|Ganga at Prayagraj]]{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} and instead directed him to argue with his student [[Mandana Misra]] in [[Mahishmati|Mahiṣmati]]. He said:
{{blockquote|You will find a home at whose gates there are a number of caged parrots discussing abstract topics like — 'Do the Vedas have self-validity or do they depend on some external authority for their validity? Are karmas capable of yielding their fruits directly, or do they require the intervention of God to do so? Is the world eternal, or is it a mere appearance?' Where you find the caged parrots discussing such abstruse philosophical problems, you will know that you have reached Maṇḍana's place.}}Kumarila's importance in the history of Indian philosophy comes to light in view of how his work has been extensively quoted.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kataoka |first=Kei |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/741557941 |title=Kumārila on truth, omniscience, and killing |last2=Kumārila Bhaṭṭa |date=2011 |publisher=Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften |isbn=978-3-7001-7001-3 |series=Beiträge zur Kultur- und Geistesgeschichte Asiens |location=Wien |pages=xvii |oclc=741557941}}</ref>
