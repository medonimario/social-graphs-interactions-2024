Tertullian originated new theological concepts and advanced the development of early Church doctrine.  However, some of his teachings, such as the [[Subordinationism|subordination]] of [[God the Son|the Son]] and [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Spirit]] to [[God the Father|the Father]], were later rejected by the Church.<ref name="lesaint">{{cite encyclopedia |author=Le Saint, W. |title=Tertullian |encyclopedia=The New Catholic Encyclopedia|date= 2003 |volume=13 |page=837}}</ref> According to [[Jerome]], he later joined the [[Montanist]] sect and may have [[apostasized]];<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tertullian {{!}} Biography, Works, Theology, Montanism, & Facts  |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tertullian |access-date=2022-04-11 |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica |language=en}}</ref> however, modern scholars dispute this.{{sfn|Barnes|1971|p=11}}

== Life ==
Scant reliable evidence exists regarding Tertullian's life; most knowledge comes from passing references in his own writings. [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]] was famous as the home of [[orator]]s, and that influence can be seen in his writing style with its archaisms or provincialisms, its glowing imagery and its passionate temper. He was a [[scholar]] with an excellent education. He wrote at least three books in [[Koine Greek]]; none of them are extant.

Some sources describe him as [[Berbers|Berber]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IkwBAAAAMAAJ|title=L'Algérie et son passé: ouvrage illustré de 82 gravures en phototypie|last=Berthier|first=André|date=1951|publisher=Picard|page=25|isbn=978-2-7084-0171-6|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BYtAQAAIAAJ|title=Intellectual Traditions of Pre-colonial Africa|last=Hilliard|first=Constance B.|date=1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-028898-0|page=150|language=en}}</ref> The linguist René Braun suggested that he was of [[Punics|Punic]] origin but acknowledged that it is difficult to decide since the heritage of Carthage had become common to the Berbers.<ref name="Wilhite">{{Cite book|last=Wilhite|first=David E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXNJeW0g6kMC&pg=PA134|title=Tertullian the African: An Anthropological Reading of Tertullian's Context and Identities|date=2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-092626-2|page=134|language=en}}</ref> Tertullian's own understanding of his ethnicity has been questioned:<ref name="Wilhite" /> He referred to himself as ''Poenicum inter Romanos'' ({{Literal translation|Punic among Romans}}) in his book ''De Pallio''<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Young|first1=Frances Margaret|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTpSoYGM2WcC&pg=PA358|title=Other Greek Writers, John of Damascus and Beyond, the West to Hilary|last2=Edwards|first2=Mark J.|last3=Parvis|first3=Paul M.|date=2006|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-1885-6|language=en}}</ref> and claimed Africa as his ''patria''.<ref name="Wilhite" /> According to church tradition, Tertullian was raised in Carthage.<ref name ="Oxford">{{cite book| editor-last =Cross | editor-first = F.

Tertullian has been claimed to have been a trained lawyer and an ordained priest. Those assertions rely on the accounts of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'', II, ii. 4, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]'' (''On famous men'') chapter 53.{{efn|See introduction to {{harv |Barnes|1971}}; however, Barnes retracted some of his positions in the 1985 revised edition.}} Tertullian has also been thought to be a lawyer, based on his use of legal analogies and on an identification of him with the jurist Tertullianus, who is quoted in the ''[[Pandects]]''. Although Tertullian used a knowledge of Roman law in his writings, his legal knowledge does not demonstrably exceed what could be expected from a sufficient Roman education.{{sfn|Barnes|1971|pp=24, 27}} The writings of Tertullianus, a lawyer of the same ''[[agnomen]]'', exist only in fragments and do not explicitly denote a Christian authorship. The notion of Tertullian being a priest is also questionable. In his extant writings, he never describes himself as ordained in the church{{sfn|Barnes|1971|p=11}} and seems to place himself among the laity.<ref>Tertullian, De Exhortatione Castitatis 7.3 and De Monogamia 12.2</ref>

His conversion to Christianity perhaps took place about 197–198 (cf. [[Adolf Harnack]], [[Bonwetsch]], and others), but its immediate antecedents are unknown except as they are conjectured from his writings. The event must have been sudden and decisive, transforming at once his own personality. He writes that he could not imagine a truly Christian life without such a conscious breach, a radical act of conversion: "Christians are made, not born" (''Apol''., xviii). Two books addressed to his wife confirm that he was married to a Christian wife.<ref>{{cite web|title=Book Written to His Wife|website=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0404.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304214727/http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0404.htm|archive-date=2014-03-04}}</ref>

In his middle life (about 207), he was attracted to the "New Prophecy" of [[Montanism]], but today most scholars reject the assertion that Tertullian left the mainstream church or was excommunicated.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXnQjPvrDZUC&q=%22overwhelming+consensus+that+Tertullian+was+not+a+Montanist+schismatic%22&pg=PA46

In the time of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], a group of "Tertullianists" still had a basilica in Carthage, which within the same period passed to the orthodox church. It is unclear whether the name was merely another for the North African Montanists{{efn|The passage in ''[[Praedestinatus]]'' describing the Tertullianists suggests that might have been the case, as the Tertullianist minister obtains the use of a church in Rome on the grounds that the martyrs to whom it was dedicated were Montanists.  However, the passage is very condensed and ambiguous.}} or that it means that Tertullian later split with the Montanists and founded his own group.

Jerome<ref>{{cite book|author= Jerome |title=De viris illustribus | page =53}}</ref> says that Tertullian lived to old age. By the doctrinal works he published, Tertullian became the teacher of [[Cyprian]] and the predecessor of Augustine, a key figure of western theology.

== Writings ==

=== General character ===
Thirty-one works are extant, together with fragments of more. Some fifteen works in Latin or Greek are lost, some as recently as the 9th century (''De Paradiso, De superstitione saeculi, De carne et anima'' were all extant in the now damaged [[Codex Agobardinus]] in 814 AD). Tertullian's writings cover the whole theological field of the time{{snd}}[[apologetics]] against paganism and Judaism, [[polemic]]s, polity, discipline, and morals, or the whole reorganization of human life on a Christian basis; they gave a picture of the religious life and thought of the time which is of great interest to the church historian.

Like other early [[Christianity|Christian]] writers Tertullian used the term ''paganus'' to mean "civilian" as a contrast to the "soldiers of Christ".<ref>Ernest Weekley, ''Etymological Dictionary of English'', s.v. "pagan".</ref> The motif of [[Miles Christianus|Miles Christi]] did not assume the literal meaning of participation in war until Church doctrines justifying Christian participation in battle were developed around the 5th century.<ref>{{Cite journal| issn = 1449-9320| volume = 8| issue = Journal Article| pages = 77–| last = Iwanczak| first = Wojciech| title = Miles Christi: the medieval ideal of knighthood| journal = Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association| date = 2012| url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GPS&sw=w&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA454359740&asid=b7bcab1e0aab147ff62b696318501ae7}}</ref> In the 2nd-century writings of Tertullian, ''paganus'' meant a "civilian" who was lacking self-discipline.

 |}

=== Chronology and contents ===
The chronology of his writings is difficult to fix with certainty. In his work against [[Marcion]], which he calls his third composition on the Marcionite heresy, he gives its date as the fifteenth year of the reign of Severus (''Adv. Marcionem'', i.1, 15) – which would be approximately 208.

The writings may be divided according to their subject matter, falling into two groups: Apologetic and polemic writings, like ''[[Apologeticus]]'', ''De testimonio animae'', the [[anti-Judaism|anti-Jewish]] ''[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/An Answer to the Jews|Adversus Iudaeos]]'', ''Adv. Marcionem'', ''Adv. Praxeam'', ''Adv. Hermogenem'', ''De praescriptione hereticorum'', and ''Scorpiace'' were written to counteract [[Gnosticism]] and other religious or philosophical doctrines. The other group consists of practical and disciplinary writings, e.g., ''De monogamia'', ''Ad uxorem'', ''De virginibus velandis'', ''De cultu feminarum'', ''De patientia'', ''De pudicitia'', ''De oratione'', and ''Ad martyras''.

Among his apologetic writings, the ''Apologeticus'', addressed to the Roman magistrates, is a most pungent defense of Christianity and the Christians against the reproaches of the pagans, and an important legacy of the ancient Church, proclaiming the principle of [[freedom of religion]] as an inalienable human right and demanding a fair trial for Christians before they are condemned to death.

Tertullian was the first to disprove charges that Christians sacrificed infants at the [[Eucharist|celebration of the Lord's Supper]] and committed incest. He pointed to the commission of such crimes in the pagan world and then proved by the testimony of [[Pliny the Younger]] that Christians pledged themselves not to commit murder, adultery, or other crimes. He adduced the inhumanity of pagan customs such as feeding the flesh of gladiators to beasts. He argued that the gods have no existence and thus there is no pagan religion against which Christians may offend. Christians do not engage in the foolish worship of the emperors, that they do better: they pray for them, and that Christians can afford to be put to torture and to death, and the more they are cast down the more they grow; "the blood of the Christians is seed" (''Apologeticum'', 50). In the ''De Praescriptione'' he develops as its fundamental idea that, in a dispute between the Church and a separating party, the whole [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] lies with the latter, as the Church, in possession of the unbroken tradition, is by its very existence a guarantee of its truth.

The five books against Marcion, written in 207 or 208, are the most comprehensive and elaborate of his polemical works, invaluable for gauging the early Christian view of Gnosticism. Tertullian has been identified by Jo Ann McNamara as the person who originally invested the consecrated virgin as the "bride of Christ", which helped to bring the independent virgin under patriarchal rule.{{sfn|Bitel|2008|p=17}}

Scholars in the past accepting the Montanist theory have also divided his work into earlier Catholic works and the later supposedly Montanist works (cf. Harnack, ii.262 sqq.), aiming to show the change of views Tertullian's mind underwent.

===Manuscripts===
The earliest [[manuscript]] (handwritten copy) of any of Tertullian's works dates to the eighth century, but most are of the fifteenth. There are five main collections of Tertullian's works, known as the ''Cluniacense'', ''Corbeiense'', ''Trecense'', ''Agobardinum'' and ''Ottobonianus''. Some of Tertullian's works are [[Lost literary work|lost]]. All the manuscripts of the ''Corbeiense'' collection are also now lost, although the collection survives in early printed editions.<ref>[https://tertullian.org/manuscripts/index.htm The Text Tradition: An Introduction to and Overview of the Manuscripts], from The Tertullian Project. It contains a complete list of known surviving and lost manuscripts of Tertullian.</ref>

== Theology ==

=== Specific teachings ===
Tertullian's main doctrinal teachings are as follows:

====God====
Tertullian reserves the appellation God, in the sense of the ultimate originator of all things, to the Father,<ref name="stanford">{{cite encyclopedia |author=Tuggy, Dale |editor=Zalta, Edward N. |title=History of Trinitarian Doctrines |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2016/entries/trinity/trinity-history.html#Tertul |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |access-date=24 September 2016|date=2016}}</ref> who made the world out of nothing though his Son, the Word, has corporeity, though he is a spirit ({{lang|la|De praescriptione}}, vii.; {{lang|la|Adv. Praxeam}}, vii). However Tertullian used 'corporeal' only in the [[stoicism|Stoic]] sense, to mean something with actual material existence, rather than the later idea of flesh.

Tertullian is often considered an early proponent of the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene doctrine]], approaching the subject from the standpoint of the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos doctrine]], though he did not state the later doctrine of the [[immanent Trinity]]. In his treatise against Praxeas, who taught [[patripassianism]] in Rome, he used the words "trinity", "economy" (used in reference to the three persons), "persons", and "substance", maintaining the distinction of the Son from the Father as the unoriginate God, and the Spirit from both the Father and the Son ({{lang|la|Adv. Praxeam}}, xxv). "These three are one substance, not one person; and it is said, 'I and my Father are one' in respect not of the singularity of number but the unity of the substance." The very names "Father" and "Son" indicate the distinction of personality. The Father is one, the Son is another, and the Spirit is another ({{lang|la|"dico alium esse patrem et alium filium et alium spiritum"}} {{lang|la|Adv. Praxeam}}, ix)), and yet in defending the unity of God, he says the Son is not other ({{lang|la|"alius a patre filius non est"}}, ({{lang|la|Adv. Prax.}} 18) as a result of receiving a portion of the Father's substance.<ref name="stanford" /> At times, speaking of the Father and the Son, Tertullian refers to "two gods".<ref name="stanford" />{{efn |{{lang|la|"Ergo, inquis, si deus dixit et deus fecit, si alius deus dixit et alius fecit, duo dii praedicantur. Si tam durus es, puta interim. Et ut adhuc amplius hoc putes, accipe et in psalmo duos deos dictos: Thronus tuus, deus, in aevum, &lt;virga directionis> virga regni tui; dilexisti iustitiam et odisti iniquitatem, propterea unxit te deus, deus tuus."}} ({{"'}}Therefore', thou sayest, 'if a god said and a god made, if one god said and another made, two gods are being preached.' If thou art so hard, think a little! And that thou mayest think more fully, accept that in the Psalm two gods are spoken of: 'Thy throne, God, is for ever, a sceptre of right direction is thy sceptre; thou hast loved justice and hast hated iniquity, therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee.{{'"}}) {{lang|la|Adv. Prax.}} 13}} He says that all things of the Father belong also to the Son, including his names, such as Almighty God, Most High, Lord of Hosts, or King of Israel.<ref>{{lang|la|Adv. Prax.}} 17.</ref>

Though Tertullian considered the Father to be God (Yahweh), he responded to criticism of the [[Sabellianism|Modalist]] Praxeas that this meant that Tertullian's Christianity was not monotheistic by noting that even though there was one God (Yahweh, who became the Father when the Son became his agent of creation), the Son could also be referred to as God, when referred to apart from the Father, because the Son, though subordinate to God, is entitled to be called God "from the unity of the Father" in regards to being formed from a portion of His substance.<ref name="stanford" />{{efn|{{lang|la|"Si filium nolunt secundum a patre reputari ne secundus duos faciat deos dici, ostendimus etiam duos deos in scriptura relatos et duos dominos: et tamen ne de isto scandalizentur, rationem reddimus qua dei non duo dicantur nec domini sed qua pater et filius duo, et hoc non ex separatione substantiae sed ex dispositione, cum individuum et inseparatum filium a patre pronuntiamus, nec statu sed gradu alium, qui etsi deus dicatur quando nominatur singularis, non ideo duos deos faciat sed unum, hoc ipso quod et deus ex unitate patris vocari habeat."}} ("If they do not wish that the Son be considered second to the Father, lest being second he cause it to be said that there are two gods, we have also showed that two gods are related in Scripture, and two lords. And yet, let them not be scandalized by this – we give a reason why there are not said to be two gods nor lords but rather two as a Father and a Son. And this not from separation of substance but from disposition, since we pronounce the Son undivided and unseparated from the Father, other not in status but in grade, who although he is said to be God when mentioned by himself, does not therefore make two gods but one, by the fact that he is also entitled to be called God from the unity of the Father.") {{lang|la|Adv. Prax.}} 19}} ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' comments that for Tertullian, "There was a time when there was no Son and no sin, when God was neither Father nor Judge."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14520c.htm |title=Tertullian | encyclopedia = The Catholic Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name="Princeton Theological Review 1906, pp. 56, 159">[[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B. B. Warfield]] in ''Princeton Theological Review'', 1906, pp. 56, 159.</ref> Similarly [[J.N.D. Kelly]] stated: "Tertullian followed the Apologists in dating His 'perfect generation' from His extrapolation for the work of creation; prior to that moment God could not strictly be said to have had a Son, while after it the term 'Father', which for earlier theologians generally connoted God as author of reality, began to acquire the specialized meaning of Father of the Son."<ref>J. N. D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines'', Continual International Publishing Book, c. 1960, 2000, p. 112</ref> As regards the subjects of [[subordinationism|subordination]] of the Son to the Father, the ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' has commented: "In not a few areas of theology, Tertullian's views are, of course, completely unacceptable. Thus, for example, his teaching on the Trinity reveals a subordination of Son to Father that in the later crass form of [[Arianism]] the Church rejected as heretical."<ref name="lesaint" /> Though he did not fully state the doctrine of the immanence of the Trinity, according to B. B. Warfield, he went a long distance in the way of approach to it.<ref name="Princeton Theological Review 1906, pp. 56, 159" />

====Apostolicity====
Tertullian was a defender of the necessity of apostolicity. In his ''Prescription Against Heretics'', he explicitly challenges heretics to produce evidence of the [[apostolic succession]] of their communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm|title=The Prescription against Heretics: Chapter 32}}</ref>

==== Eucharist ====
Unlike many early Christian writers, Tertullian along with [[Clement of Alexandria]] used the word "figure" and "symbol" to define the Eucharist, since in his book ''Against Marcion'' implied that: "this is my body" should be interpreted as "a figure of my body". While others have also suggested that he believed in a [[Lord's Supper in Reformed theology|spiritual presence in the Eucharist]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjIsAQAAMAAJ&dq=Tertullian+spiritual+presence+Eucharist&pg=PA136 |title=Bibliotheca Sacra and Theological Review |date=1844 |publisher=Allen, Morrill, and Wardwell |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbBPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Tertullian+spiritually+present+Eucharist&pg=PA525 |title=The British Magazine and Monthly Register of Religious and Ecclesiastical Information, Parochial History, and Documents Respecting the State of the Poor, Progress of Education, Etc. |date=1833 |publisher=J.

==== Baptism ====
Tertullian advises the postponement of baptism of little children and the unmarried, he mentions that it was customary to baptise infants, with sponsors speaking on their behalf.<ref>"The delay of baptism is preferable; principally, however, in the case of little children. For why is it necessary&nbsp;... that the sponsors likewise should be thrust into danger?&nbsp;... For no less cause must the unwedded also be deferred—in whom the ground of temptation is prepared, alike in such as never were wedded by means of their maturity, and in the widowed by means of their freedom—until they either marry, or else be more fully strengthened for continence." {{cite book |title=[[Ante-Nicene Fathers (book)|The Ante-Nicene Fathers: The Writings of the Fathers Down to A.D. 325]] |volume=3 |at=Part III, Chapter 18 |year=1885 |publisher=Christian Literature Company |editor-first1=Alexander |editor-last1=Roberts |editor-first2=James |editor-last2=Donaldson |editor-first3=Arthur Cleveland |editor-last3=Coxe |editor-first4=Philip |editor-last4=Schaff |display-authors=etal}} For the text, see [[s:Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_III/Ethical/On_Baptism/XVIII|Wikisource]].</ref> He argued that an infant ran the risk of growing up and then falling into sin, which could cause them to lose their salvation, if they were baptized as infants.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Esler |first=Philip F. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fyCAgAAQBAJ&dq=Tertullian+ex+opere+operato&pg=PA570 |title=The Early Christian World |date=2002-09-11 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-54919-1 |language=en}}</ref>

Contrary to early Syrian baptismal doctrine and practice, Tertullian describes baptism as a cleansing and preparation process which precedes the reception of the Holy Spirit in post-baptismal anointing ({{lang|la|De Baptismo}} 6). {{lang|la|De Baptismo}} includes the earliest known mention of a prayer for the consecration of the waters of baptism.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Maxwell E. |title=The rites of Christian initiation: their evolution and interpretation |date=2007 |publisher=Liturgical Press |isbn=978-0-8146-6215-1 |edition=revised and expanded |location=Collegeville, Minnesota |oclc=123485489}}</ref>

Tertullian had an {{lang|la|[[ex opere operato]]}} view of the baptism, thus the efficiency of baptism was not dependent upon the faith of the receiver.<ref name=":2" /> He also believed that in an emergency, the laity can give the baptism.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Still |first1=Todd D. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7GLm2X6BRdEC&dq=Tertullian+outside+the+church+no+salvation&pg=PA176 |title=Tertullian and Paul |last2=Wilhite |first2=David |date=2012-12-20 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=978-0-567-00803-9 |language=en}}</ref>

==== The Church ====
According to James Puglisi, Tertullian interpreted that in Matthew 16:18–19 "the rock" refers to Peter. For him, Peter is the type of the one Church and its origins, this Church, is now present in a variety of local churches.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last=Puglisi |first=James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZ2vkWM8IpwC&dq=Tertullian+pope+calixtus&pg=PA36 |title=How Can the Petrine Ministry Be a Service to the Unity of the Universal Church? |date=2010-11-09 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans |isbn=978-0-8028-4862-8 |language=en}}</ref> He also believed that the power to "bind and unbind" has passed from Peter to the apostles and prophets of the Montanist church, not the bishops.{{dubious|date=March 2024}} He mocked [[Pope Callixtus I|Pope Calixtus]] or [[Agrippinus of Carthage|Agrippinus]] (it is debated which one he was referring to) when he challenged him on the Church forgiving capital sinners and letting them back into the church.<ref name=":3" /> He believed that the people who committed grave sins, such as sorcery, fornication and murder, should not be let inside the church.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gomez |first=Cristina Lledo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mObDwAAQBAJ&dq=Tertullian+Fornicators&pg=PT79 |title=The Church as Woman and Mother: Historical and Theological Foundations |date=2018 |publisher=Paulist Press |isbn=978-1-58768-694-8 |language=en}}</ref>

As a Montanist,{{dubious|date=March 2024}} he attacked the church authorities as more interested in their own political power in the church than in listening to the Spirit. Tertullian's criticism of Church authorities has been compared to the [[Reformation|Protestant reformation]].<!--ref>{{Cite web |title=Tertullian: The Montanists |url=https://www.tertullian.org/montanism.htm |access-date=2022-07-03 |website=The Tertullian Project}}</ref-->

==== Marriage ====
Tertullian's later view of marriage, such as in his book ''Exhortation to Chastity'', may have been heavily influenced by Montanism. He had previously held marriage to be fundamentally good, but after his conversion{{dubious|date=March 2024}} he denied its goodness. He argues that marriage is considered to be good "when it is compared with the greatest of all evils". He argued that before the coming of Christ, the command to reproduce was a prophetic sign pointing to the coming of the Church; after it came, the command was superseded. He also believed lust for one's wife and for another woman were essentially the same, so that marital desire was similar to adulterous desire. He believed that sex even in marriage would disrupt the Christian life and that abstinence was the best way to achieve the clarity of the soul. Tertullian's views would later influence much of the [[Western Christianity|western church]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite book |last=Schafer |first=Steven |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0uvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Tertullian+Fornicators&pg=PA10 |title=Marriage, Sex, and Procreation: Contemporary Revisions to Augustine's Theology of Marriage |date=2019-09-09 |publisher=Wipf and Stock |isbn=978-1-5326-7182-1 |language=en}}</ref> 

Tertullian was the first to introduce a view of "sexual hierarchy": he believed that those who abstain from sexual relations should have a higher hierarchy in the church than those who do not, because he saw sexual relations as a barrier that stopped one from a close relationship with God.<ref name=":5" />

==== Scripture ====
Tertullian did not have a specific listing of the canon; however, he quotes [[First Epistle of John|1 John]], [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]], [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]], [[Revelation]], the [[Pauline epistles]] and the [[four Gospels]]. In his later books, he also started to use the [[The Shepherd of Hermas|Shepherd of Hermas]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=McDonald |first=Lee Martin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfvUDQAAQBAJ&dq=Tertullian+canon&pg=PA80 |title=The Formation of the Biblical Canon: Volume 2: The New Testament: Its Authority and Canonicity |date=2017-01-26 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-0-567-66885-1 |language=en}}</ref> Tertullian made no references to the [[book of Tobit]]; however, in his book ''Adversus Marcionem'' he quotes the [[book of Judith]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hengel |first=Martin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUmGZ0NiweAC&dq=Tertullian+tobit&pg=PA117 |title=Septuagint As Christian Scripture |date=2004-05-01 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=978-0-567-08287-9 |language=en}}</ref> He quoted most of the [[Old Testament]] including many [[deuterocanonical books]], however he never used the books of [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]], [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], [[Book of Esther|Esther]], [[2 Maccabees]], [[Second Epistle of John|2 John]] and [[Third Epistle of John|3 John]].<ref name=":6">{{Cite book |last1=Tertullianus |first1=Quintus Septimius Florens |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kHYl6rhy4FkC&dq=Tertullian+apocrypha&pg=PA13 |title=Tertullian |last2=Dunn |first2=Geoffrey D. |date=2004 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-28231-4 |language=en}}</ref> He defended the [[Book of Enoch]] and he believed that the book was omitted by the Jews from the canon. He believed that the [[epistle to the Hebrews]] was made by [[Barnabas]].<ref name=":6" /> For Tertullian, scripture was authoritative; he used scripture as the primary source in almost every chapter of his every work, and very rarely anything else.<ref name=":6" /> He seems to prioritize the authority of scripture above anything else.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book |last1=Tertullianus |first1=Quintus Septimius Florens |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kHYl6rhy4FkC&dq=Tertullian+apocrypha&pg=PA13 |title=Tertullian |translator-last=Dunn |translator-first=Geoffrey D. |date=2004 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-28231-4 |page=15 |language=en}}</ref>

When interpreting scripture, he would occasionally believe passages to be allegorical or symbolic, while in other places he would support a literal interpretation. He would especially use allegorical interpretations when dealing with Christological prophecies of the Old Testament.<ref name=":7" /> Scripture was a record of the earlier Tradition that should not be interpreted outside that tradition: scripture should not be cherry-picked and early interpretations should be preferred over later ones.

=== Other beliefs ===
Tertullian denied Mary's virginity ''in partu'',{{sfn|Wirth|2016|p=167}} and he was quoted by [[Helvidius]] in his debate with Jerome.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wirth|first=Douglas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u584DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT168|title=Shivering Babe, Glorious Lord: The Nativity Stories in Christian Tradition|date=2016-05-13|publisher=WestBow Press|isbn=978-1-5127-3871-1|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Philip Schaff: History of the Christian Church, Volume III: Nicene and Post-Nicene Christianity.

Tertullian's views of angels and demons were influenced by the Book of Enoch. He held that the Nephilim were born out of fallen angels who mingled with human women and had sexual relations.

=== Montanism ===
The extent and nature of Tertullian's involvement to Montanism is now  disputed by modern scholars. Montanism in North Africa seems to have been a counter-reaction against secularism. The form of Montanism in North Africa seems to have differed from the views of [[Montanus]], and thus the North African Montanists believed Catholic bishops to be successors of the apostles, the New Testament to be the supreme authority on Christianity and they did not deny most doctrines of the Church.<ref name=":22">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Montanism}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Montanism |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Montanism |access-date=2022-04-07 |language=en}}</ref>

Tertullian was drawn to Montanism, if he was, mainly because of its strict moral standards.{{citation needed|date=September 2024}} He believed that the [[Great Church|Church]] had forsaken the Christian way of life and entered a path of destruction.{{citation needed|date=September 2024}} 

==== Tertullianists ====
Tertullianists were a group mentioned by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] as founded by Tertullian.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tabbernee |first=William |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j2dAY4kKZRgC&dq=Augustine+Tertullianism&pg=PA268 |title=Fake Prophecy and Polluted Sacraments: Ecclesiastical and Imperial Reactions to Montanism |date=2007 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-15819-1 |language=en}}</ref> There exists differences of opinion on Tertullianists; Augustine seems to have believed that Tertullian, soon after joining the [[Montanism|Montanists]], started his own sect derived from Montanism, while some scholars believe that Augustine was in error, and that Tertullianists was simply an alternative name of North African Montanism and not a separate sect.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tabbernee |first=William |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j2dAY4kKZRgC&dq=Augustine+Tertullianism&pg=PA268 |title=Fake Prophecy and Polluted Sacraments: Ecclesiastical and Imperial Reactions to Montanism |date=2007 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-15819-1 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Binder |first=Stephanie E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAYUjbBe8ggC&dq=Tertullianism&pg=PA56 |title=Tertullian, On Idolatry and Mishnah Avodah Zarah: Questioning the Parting of the Ways Between Christians and Jews |date=2012-11-13 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-23478-9 |language=en}}</ref>

== Moral principles ==

Tertullian was an advocate of discipline and an austere code of practise, and like many of the African fathers, one of the leading representatives of the rigorist element in the early Church. His writings on public amusements, the veiling of virgins, the conduct of women, and the like, reflect these opinions. His views may have led him to adopt [[Montanism]] with its ascetic [[rigor]] and its belief in [[chiliasm]] and the continuance of the prophetic gifts. Geoffrey D. Dunn writes that "Some of Tertullian's treatises reveal that he had much in common with Montanism ... To what extent, if at all, this meant that he joined a group that was schismatic (or, to put it another way, that he left the church) continues to be debated".<ref name="Dunn 2004 p. 4">{{cite book | last=Dunn | first=G.D. | title=Tertullian | publisher=Routledge | series=Early church fathers | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-415-28231-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kHYl6rhy4FkC&pg=PA4 | access-date=11 Jul 2023 | page=4}}</ref>

On the principle that we should not look at or listen to what we have no right to practise, and that polluted things, seen and touched, pollute (''De spectaculis'', viii, xvii), he declared a Christian should abstain from the theatre and the amphitheatre. There pagan religious rites were applied and the names of pagan divinities invoked; there the precepts of modesty, purity, and humanity were ignored or set aside, and there no place was offered to the onlookers for the cultivation of the Christian graces. Women should put aside their gold and precious stones as ornaments,<ref>''De cultu'', v–vi</ref> and virgins should conform to the law of St. Paul for women and keep themselves strictly veiled (''De virginibus velandis''). He praised the unmarried state as the highest (''De monogamia'', xvii; ''Ad uxorem'', i.3) and called upon Christians not to allow themselves to be excelled in the virtue of celibacy by [[Vestal Virgin]]s and Egyptian priests. He even labeled second marriage a species of adultery (''De exhortatione castitatis'', ix), but this directly contradicted the Epistles of the [[Apostle Paul]]. Tertullian's resolve to never marry again and that no one else should remarry eventually led to his break with Rome because the orthodox church refused to follow him in this resolve. He, instead, favored the Montanist sect where they also condemned second marriage.{{sfn|Bitel|2008|p=21}} One reason for Tertullian's disdain for marriage was his belief about the transformation that awaited a married couple. He believed that marital relations coarsened the body and spirit and would dull their spiritual senses and avert the Holy Spirit since husband and wife became one flesh once married.{{sfn|Bitel|2008|p=17}}

Tertullian has been criticised as [[misogynistic]], on the basis of the contents of his ''De Cultu Feminarum'', section I.I, part 2 (trans. C.W. Marx):<ref name="Amy Place 2020 p. 260">{{cite book | last=Place|first=Amy|chapter=Fashioning the Female in the Early North African Church|editor-last1=Harlow | editor-first1=M. | editor-last2=Michel | editor-first2=C. | editor-last3=Quillien | editor-first3=L. | title=Textiles and Gender in Antiquity: From the Orient to the Mediterranean | publisher=Bloomsbury Academic | series=Bloomsbury Classical Studies Monographs: Classics & Archaeology | year=2020 | isbn=978-1-350-14149-0 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6IyEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA260 | access-date=11 Jul 2023 | page=260}}</ref><ref name="Ferguson 1999 p. 44">{{cite book | last=McKechnie|first=Paul|chapter="Women's Religion" and Second Century Christianity|editor-last=Ferguson | editor-first=Everett | title=Christianity and Society: The Social World of Early Christianity | publisher=Garland Pub. | series=Garland series | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-8153-3068-4 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awAeGS_mnokC&pg=PA44 | access-date=11 Jul 2023 | page=44}}</ref> "Do you not know that you are [[Eve]]?

Because of what you deserve, that is, death, even the Son of God had to die."

The critic [[Amy Place]] notes, however, that "Revisionist studies later rehabilitated" Tertullian.<ref name="Amy Place 2020 p. 260"/> This is discussed by other theorists such as Benjamin H. Dunning.<ref name="Dunning 2011 p. 126">{{cite book | last=Dunning | first=B.H. | title=Specters of Paul: Sexual Difference in Early Christian Thought | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press, Incorporated | series=Divinations: Rereading Late Ancient Religion | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-8122-0435-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hy24NoIRLu8C&pg=PA126 | access-date=11 Jul 2023 | page=126}}</ref>

Tertullian had a radical view on the cosmos. He believed that heaven and earth intersected at many points and that it was possible that sexual relations with supernatural beings can occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_1715.asp |title=Scholar Discusses the 'Bride of Christ' in the Early Church |website=Fordham.edu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118102358/https://legacy.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_1715.asp |archive-date=November 18, 2018 }}</ref>

=== Spurious works ===
There have been many works attributed to Tertullian in the past which have since been determined to be almost definitely written by others. Nonetheless, since their actual authors remain uncertain, they continue to be published together in collections of Tertullian's works.
* 1 ''Adversus Omnes Haereses'' (Against all Heresies) – poss. [[Victorinus of Pettau]]
* 2 ''De execrandis gentium diis'' (On the Execrable Gods of the Heathens)
* 3 ''Carmen adversus Marcionem'' (Poem against Marcion)
* 4 ''Carmen de Iona Propheta'' (Poem about the Prophet Jonas) – poss. [[Cyprianus Gallus]]
* 5 ''Carmen de Sodoma'' (Poem about Sodom) – poss. [[Cyprianus Gallus]]
* 6 ''Carmen de Genesi'' (Poem about Genesis)
* 7 ''Carmen de Judicio Domini'' (Poem about the Judgment of the Lord)

The popular ''Passio SS. Perpetuae et Felicitatis'' (Martyrdom of SS. Perpetua and Felicitas), much of it presented as the personal diary of St. [[Perpetua]], was once assumed to have been edited by Tertullian. That view is no longer widely held, and the work is usually published separately from Tertullian's own works.

== Influence on Novatianism ==
The [[Novatianism|Novatians]] refused forgiveness to idolaters or for people who committed other heinous sins, and made much use of the works of Tertullian; some Novatians even joined [[Montanism|Montanists]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-04-03|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Novatian and Novatianism|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11138a.htm|access-date=2022-02-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403211934/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11138a.htm|archive-date=2019-04-03}}</ref> The views of [[Novatian]] on the [[Trinity]] and [[Christology]] are also strongly influenced by Tertullian.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Novatian|url=http://earlychristianwritings.com/novatian.html|access-date=2022-02-18|website=earlychristianwritings.com}}</ref>

Ronald E. Heine writes, "With Novatianism we return to the spirit of Tertullian, and the issue of Christian discipline.<ref name=":1" />
