'''Władysław Tatarkiewicz''' ({{IPA|pol|vwaˈdɨswaf tatarˈkʲevitʂ|lang}}; 3 April 1886 &ndash; 4 April 1980) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]], historian of [[philosophy]], historian of [[art]], [[esthetics|esthetician]], and [[ethics|ethicist]].<ref>"Władysław Tatarkiewicz," ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', p.&nbsp;686.</ref>

==Early life and education==
Tatarkiewicz began his higher education at [[Warsaw University]]. When it was closed by the [[Russian Imperial]] authorities in 1905, he was forced to continue his education abroad in [[Marburg]], [[Germany]], where he studied from 1907 to 1910.<ref>Marek Jaworski, ''Władysław Tatarkiewicz'', pp. 26–36.</ref>

==Career==
As he describes in his ''Memoirs'', it was a chance encounter with a male relative, whose height made him stand out above the crowd at a [[Kraków]] railroad station, upon the outbreak of [[World War I]] that led Tatarkiewicz to spend the war years in [[Warsaw]].<ref>Władysław Tatarkiewicz, ''Wspomnienia'' (Memoirs), p. 144.</ref> There he began his career as a lecturer in philosophy, teaching at a girls' school on [[Mokotowska Street]], across the street from where [[Józef Piłsudski]] was to reside during his first days after World War I.

During [[World War I]], when the Polish University of Warsaw was opened under the sponsorship of the occupying Germans – who wanted to win Polish support for their war effort – Tatarkiewicz directed its philosophy department in 1915–19.

In 1919–21 he was professor at [[Stefan Batory University]] in [[Wilno]], in 1921–23 at the [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań|University of Poznań]], and in 1923–61 again at the [[University of Warsaw]]. In 1930 he became a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]].<ref>"Władysław Tatarkiewicz," ''Encyklopedia powszechna PWN'', vol. 4, p. 412.</ref>

During [[World War II]], risking his life, he conducted [[Flying University|underground lectures]] in German-occupied Warsaw<ref>Władysław Tatarkiewicz, ''Wspomnienia'' (Memoirs), p. 165–68.</ref> (one of the audience members was [[Czesław Miłosz]]).<ref>Władysław Tatarkiewicz, ''Wspomnienia'' (Memoirs), p. 171.</ref> After the suppression of the [[Warsaw Uprising]] (August–October 1944) he again consciously risked his life when retrieving a manuscript from the gutter, where a German soldier had hurled it (this and other materials were later published as a book, in English translation titled ''Analysis of Happiness'').<ref>* Władysław Tatarkiewicz, ''Analysis of Happiness'', p. xi.</ref>

After World War II, he taught at the [[University of Warsaw]]. In March 1950 Tatarkiewicz was demoted and banned from teaching after seven of his students (including [[Henryk Holland]] and [[Leszek Kołakowski]]), who were activists in the [[PZPR|Polish United Workers' Party]], presented a "Letter of 7" which denounced him for "privileging 'objective-bourgois' science instead of Marxist engagement" and opposing "the construction of socialism in Poland".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wagner |first=Izabela |title=Bauman: A Biography |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2020 |isbn=978-1509526895}}</ref>

Władysław Tatarkiewicz died the day after his 94th birthday. In his ''Memoirs'', published shortly before, he recalled having been ousted from his University chair (by Henryk Holland, a politically connected former student<ref>See (in Polish): ''"List grupy uczestników seminarium filozoficznego profesora Władysława Tatarkiewicza"'' (Letter by Participants in Professor Władysław Tatarkiewicz's Philosophy Seminar"), ''Przegląd Filozoficzny'' (Philosophical Review), no. 2, 1995 (14), p. 88.</ref>). Characteristically, he saw even that indignity as a blessing in disguise, as it gave him freedom from academic duties, and leisure to pursue research and writing.<ref>Władysław Tatarkiewicz, ''Wspomnienia'' (Memoirs), p. 119.</ref>

{{blockquote|And in sum it is a good existence:  that of a retired old professor.  He still has something to do, but is under no compulsion.  He only voluntarily imposes compulsions on himself.  He has time:  at any time of day, he can go for a walk in the park—as long as his legs will still carry him.  Equally, or even more, important is this:  he no longer has ambition, he has ceased to be a rival to others.  He is no inconvenience to others, they have no need to fear him, they have no reason to envy him:  in this situation—without opponents, rivals and enemies—life is considerably more tolerable.<ref>Władysław Tatarkiewicz, ''Wspomnienia'' (Memoirs), pp. 172–73.</ref>|}}

Tatarkiewicz reflected that at all crucial junctures of his life, he had failed to foresee events, many of them tragic, but that this had probably been for the better, since he could not have altered them anyway.<ref>Władysław Tatarkiewicz, ''Wspomnienia'' (Memoirs), p. 181.</ref>

==View on happiness==
Tatarkiewicz believed that "satisfaction with particular things... is only partial satisfaction; happiness requires total satisfaction, that is, satisfaction with life as a whole."<ref>Alex Michalos [https://search.proquest.com/openview/6b042353db50565f7e667978915d1ae3/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1818345 Review of W. Tatarkiewicz, "Analysis of Happiness".]</ref>

== Major works ==
Tatarkiewicz belonged to the [[Interwar period|interwar]] [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic]], created by [[Kazimierz Twardowski]], which gave reborn Poland many scholars and scientists:  philosophers, logicians, [[psychologists]], [[sociologists]], and organizers of [[academia]].<ref>Władysław Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys dziejów filozofii w Polsce'' (A Brief History of Philosophy in Poland), pp. 31–32.</ref>

Tatarkiewicz educated generations of Polish philosophers, estheticians and art historians, as well as a multitude of interested laymen.<ref>"Władysław Tatarkiewicz," ''Encyklopedia powszechna PWN'', vol. 4, p. 412.</ref> He posthumously continues to do so through his ''History of Philosophy'' and numerous other works.
