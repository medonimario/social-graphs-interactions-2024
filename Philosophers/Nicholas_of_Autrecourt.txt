{{Short description|French philosopher (c. 1299–1369)}}
'''Nicholas of Autrecourt''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Nicholas d'Autrécourt''; [[Latin]]: ''Nicolaus de Autricuria'' or ''Nicolaus de Ultricuria''; c. 1299, [[Autrécourt-sur-Aire|Autrecourt]] – 16 or 17 July 1369, [[Metz]]) was a French [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosopher]] and [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] [[theologian]].

==Life and thought==
Born in [[Autrécourt-sur-Aire|Autrecourt]], near [[Verdun]], he was educated at Paris and earned bachelor's degrees in theology and law and a master's degree in arts.<ref name="Zupkoarticle" /> Nicholas is known principally for developing [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]] to extreme [[logic]]al conclusions. He is sometimes considered the sole genuinely skeptic philosopher of medieval times. Nicholas founded his skeptical position on arguments that knowledge claims were not "reducible to the first principle," that is, that it was not contradictory to deny them.<ref name=Franklin>{{cite book |last=Franklin |first=James |author-link=James Franklin (philosopher) |date=2001 |title=The Science of Conjecture, Evidence and Probability before Pascal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zDECQAAQBAJ |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |pages=210–216 |isbn=9780801865695}}</ref> His views have been compared to those of [[David Hume]], but it has been suggested that the similarities are superficial, and there is no evidence Nicholas influenced Hume, or other modern philosophers such as [[René Descartes]].<ref name="Zupkoarticle">{{cite book |author=Zupko, Jack A. |editor=Robert Audi |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1999 |page=612 |isbn=0-521-63722-8 }}</ref> Whether Nicholas was committed to skepticism is unclear, but on 19 May 1346 his views were condemned by [[Pope Clement VI]] as [[heresy|heretical]]. Nicholas was sentenced to burn his books publicly and recant, which he did in Paris in 1347.<ref name="Zupkoarticle" />

In the 14th century, Nicholas of Autrecourt considered that matter, space, and time were all made up of indivisible atoms, points, and instants and that all generation and corruption took place by the rearrangement of material atoms. The similarities of his ideas with those of [[al-Ghazali]] suggest that Nicholas was familiar with the work of al-Ghazali, who was known as "Algazel" in Europe, either directly or indirectly through [[Averroes]].

Much of the extant knowledge of Nicholas of Autrecourt's epistemology derives from one letter written by magister Egidius (master Giles) to Nicholas and an excerpt from his letter in reply to Egidius and from nine letters written by Nicholas to the Franciscan theologian Bernardus Aretinus (Bernard of [[Arezzo]]); however, only two of the nine letters survive. Some fragments of the lost letters are quoted in the records of the condemnatory proceedings against Nicholas. Almost nothing is known about these two correspondents.<ref>{{cite book|author=De Rijk, Lambertus Marie (Bertus)|title=Nicholas of Autrecourt: His Correspondence with Master Giles and Bernard of Arezzo|location=Leiden|publisher=E.
