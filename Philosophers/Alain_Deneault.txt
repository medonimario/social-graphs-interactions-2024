=== Lawsuits ===
Following the publication of ''Noir Canada'', mining company [[Barrick Gold]] sent [[Écosociété]] a threatening letter regarding alleged inaccuracies in the book's description of evictions at the [[Bulyanhulu Gold Mine]] in Tanzania in 1996. The book's launch was postponed as a result, but the publisher managed to distribute 1,700 copies. Barrick filed a $6-million lawsuit against the authors and the publisher for libel.<ref name=UtterFiction>{{cite news|title=Barrick Gold lawsuit alleges Quebec book is 'utter fiction'|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/barrick-gold-lawsuit-alleges-quebec-book-is-utter-fiction-1.757215|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=CBC News|date=6 May 2008}}</ref>

The lawsuit has been considered by some to be a [[strategic lawsuit against public participation]] (SLAPP). On 12 August 2011 the [[Quebec Superior Court]] ruled that "Barrick seems to be trying to intimidate authors", that the suit was "seemingly abusive",<ref name="CAUT1">{{cite journal|title=Barrick Slapped over SLAPP Suit|journal=CAUT Bulletin|date=October 2011|volume=58|issue=8|url=http://www.cautbulletin.ca/en_article.asp?ArticleID=3318|accessdate=16 February 2014|archive-date=22 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222173130/http://www.cautbulletin.ca/en_article.asp?ArticleID=3318|url-status=dead}}</ref> and that Barrick must pay the authors and publisher $143,000 to prepare their defense. On 18 October 2011 Barrick, the authors, and the publisher reached an out-of-court settlement that included a payment to Barrick and ceasing publication of the book.<ref name="CAUT2">{{cite journal|title=Noir Canada Defamation Lawsuit Settled, Publication of Book Stopped|journal=CAUT Bulletin|date=November 2011|volume=58|issue=9|url=http://www.cautbulletin.ca/en_article.asp?ArticleID=3342|accessdate=16 February 2014|archive-date=30 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930174411/https://www.cautbulletin.ca/en_article.asp?ArticleID=3342|url-status=dead}}</ref> Deneault told news media that the authors had agreed to the settlement in order to bring an end to the legal proceedings, so that they could "return to having our discussions back in the public sphere, instead of the courtroom".<ref name="CAUT2"/>

In May 2008 a coalition of Quebec organizations formed to push for anti-SLAPP legislation. The Barrick suit against Écosociété (which joined the coalition) helped bring awareness to the cause.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ferland-Gagnon|first1=Gabrielle|last2=Lemonde|first2=Lucie|title=Les etapes de la mobilisation citoyenne et de l'adoption de la loi contre les poursuites-baillons|journal=Les Cahiers de Droit|date=March 2010|volume=51|issue=1}}</ref> On 4 June 2009 Quebec adopted an anti-SLAPP bill called "An Act to amend the Code of Civil Procedure to prevent improper use of the courts and promote freedom of expression and citizen participation in public debate".<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill n°9 : An Act to amend the Code of Civil Procedure to prevent improper use of the courts and promote freedom of expression and citizen participation in public debate|url=http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-9-39-1.html|publisher=National Assembly of Québec|accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>

In June 2008 another mining company, [[Banro Corporation]], sued the authors and publisher for allegedly defamatory content in ''Noir Canada'', for $5 million. The prosecution took place in Ontario courts, despite the fact that fewer than 100 copies of the book were distributed in the province. The publisher appealed to the Supreme Court to repatriate the suit to Quebec, partly because of its newly adopted anti-SLAPP legislation, but was denied.<ref name=Devoir>{{cite news|last=Shields|first=Alexandre|title=Écosociété règle hors cour son litige avec la minière Banro|url=https://www.ledevoir.com/societe/justice/376659/ecosociete-regle-hors-cour-son-litige-avec-la-miniere-banro|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=Le Devoir|date=26 April 2013|language=French}}</ref><ref>{{Lexum-scc|2012|18}}</ref> In 2013, the proceedings ended with an out-of-court settlement that involved Écosociété paying compensation to Banro.<ref name=Devoir />

In February 2010 Barrick Gold sent a letter threatening legal action to everyone involved in the book ''Imperial Canada Inc.: Legal Haven of Choice for the World's Mining Industries'', an English translation of a book by Deneault and William Sacher, also about the Canadian mining industry.<ref>{{cite news|title=Barrick Gold moves to block mining book|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/barrick-gold-moves-to-block-mining-book-1.885651|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=CBC News|date=12 May 2010}}</ref>
