{{Short description|American Roman Catholic theologian (1929–2018)}}
'''Germain Gabriel Grisez''' (September 30, 1929 – February 1, 2018) was a [[French-American]] philosopher.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Making of a Moral Theologian {{!}} EWTN|url=https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/making-of-a-moral-theologian-10811|access-date=2021-10-10|website=EWTN Global Catholic Television Network|language=en}}</ref>  Grisez's development of ideas from [[Thomas Aquinas]] has redirected [[Roman Catholic theology|Catholic]] thought and changed the way it has engaged with secular moral philosophy. In 'The First Principle of Practical Reason: A Commentary on the ''Summa Theologiae'', I-II, Q. 94, A. 2' (1965), Grisez attacked the neo-scholastic interpretation of Aquinas as holding that moral norms are derived from methodologically antecedent knowledge of [[human nature]]. Grisez defended the idea of [[libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical free choice]] and proposed a natural law theory of practical reasoning and moral judgment which, although broadly [[Thomism|Thomistic]], departs from Aquinas on significant points.<ref>{{cite book |author=George, Robert P. |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/328 328] |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/328 }}</ref>
