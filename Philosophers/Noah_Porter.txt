==Biography==
He was born to Noah Porter Jr. (1781–1866) (one of the first ministers of First Church of Christ, Congregational in [[Farmington, Connecticut]]) and his wife, born Mehitable Meigs, in Farmington, Connecticut, on December 14, 1811. His younger sister was [[Sarah Porter]], founder of [[Miss Porter's School]], a college preparatory school for girls.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.firstchurch1652.org/content.cfm?id=2056 | title=First Church 1652 Farmington - History in Brief }}</ref> He graduated in 1831 from Yale College, where he was a member of the [[Linonian Society]]. On April 13, 1836, in New Haven, he married Mary Taylor, daughter of [[Nathaniel William Taylor|Nathaniel Taylor]]<ref name=YaleObit/> (who presided over the creation of the [[Yale Divinity School]] and created what came to be known as "[[New Haven theology]]") and his wife Rebecca Marie Hine.  They had several children, and two daughters survived them.

He was ordained as a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister in [[New Milford, Connecticut]], from 1836 to 1843. He served as pastor at a Congregational Church in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], from 1843 to 1846.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://chestofbooks.com/reference/American-Cyclopaedia-9/Noah-Porter.html | title=Noah Porter }}</ref> He was elected professor of [[moral philosophy]] and [[metaphysics]] at Yale in 1846.

Porter was inaugurated as President of Yale College on Wednesday, October 11, 1871.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_1QUAAAAAYAAJ ''Addresses at the Inauguration of Professor Noah Porter, D.D., LL.D., as President of Yale College,''p. 3.]</ref> He continued to serve as head of the college until 1886.

Porter edited several editions of [[Webster's Dictionary]], and wrote on education.<ref>{{cite book |title= An American Dictionary of the English Language by Noah Webster, LL.D. Thoroughly Revised, and Greatly Enlarged and Improved, by Chauncey A. Goodrich, D.D., and Noah Porter, D.D.  |publisher= G.& S.

Influenced by the German refugee writer and philosopher [[Francis Lieber]], Porter opposed slavery and integrated an antislavery position with religious liberalism.

He was a frequent visitor to the [[Adirondack Mountains]] of New York, and in 1875 was among the first recorded to make an ascent of the peak later named [[Porter Mountain]] in his honor.

His best-known work is ''The Human Intellect'', with an ''Introduction upon Psychology and the Human Soul'' (1868), comprehending a general history of philosophy, and following in part the "common-sense" philosophy of the [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|Scottish school]], while accepting the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[Transcendental idealism|doctrine of intuition]], and declaring the notion of design to be ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. Of great importance were two other works, ''Elements of Intellectual Science'' (1871) and ''Elements of Moral Science'' (1885).

He died on March 4, 1892, in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]],<ref name=YaleObit/> and was buried in the [[Grove Street Cemetery]] there.
