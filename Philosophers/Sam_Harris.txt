In 2006, Harris described [[Islam]] as "all fringe and no center",<ref group=SH>{{Cite web|title=The Reality of Islam|url=https://samharris.org/the-reality-of-islam/|date=2006-02-08|website=Sam Harris|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> and wrote in ''[[The End of Faith]]'' that "the doctrine of Islam{{nbsp}}... represents a unique danger to all of us", arguing that the [[war on terror]] is really a war against Islam.<ref name="Adams-2016">{{Cite book|last=Adams|first=Alex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XR9qDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA29|page=29|title=Political Torture in Popular Culture: The Role of Representations in the Post-9/11 Torture Debate |year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-28939-5|language=en}}</ref> In 2007, Harris in the famous “Four Horsemen” debate asked fellow atheists, Hitchens, Dawkins, and Dennett, “Do you feel there's any burden we have, as critics of religion, to be evenhanded in our criticism of religion, or is it fair to notice that there's a spectrum of religious ideas and commitments and Islam is on one end of it and the Amish and the Jains and others are on another end, and there are real differences here that we have to take seriously.”<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Four Horsemen by Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett: 9780525511953 {{!}} PenguinRandomHouse.com: Books |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/586726/the-four-horsemen-by-christopher-hitchens-richard-dawkins-sam-harris-and-daniel-dennett/ |access-date=2024-09-14 |website=PenguinRandomhouse.com |language=en-US}}</ref> In 2014, Harris said he considers Islam to be "especially belligerent and inimical to the norms of civil discourse", as it involves what Harris considers to be "bad ideas, held for bad reasons, leading to bad behavior."<ref name="response-controversy"/> In 2015 Harris and secular Islamic activist [[Maajid Nawaz]] cowrote'' [[Islam and the Future of Tolerance]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Islam and the Future of Tolerance: A Dialogue |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QgGnCgAAQBAJ |year=2015 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-08870-2 |first1=Sam |last1=Harris |first2=Nawaz |last2=Maajid |access-date=14 December 2020 |archive-date=7 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200507174420/https://books.google.com/books/about/Islam_and_the_Future_of_Tolerance.html?id=QgGnCgAAQBAJ |url-status=live}}</ref> In this book, Harris argues that the word [[Islamophobia]] is a "pernicious meme", a label which prevents discussion about the threat of Islam.<ref name="Adams-2016"/> Harris has been described in 2020 by Jonathan Matusitz, Associate Professor at the [[University of Central Florida College of Sciences|University of Central Florida]], as "a champion of the [[counter-jihad]] left".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Matusitz|first=Jonathan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nx__DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1988|page=1988|title=Communication in Global Jihad|year=2020|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-000-22435-1|language=en}}</ref>

Harris is also critical of the [[Christian right]] in politics in the United States, blaming them for the political focus on "pseudo-problems like gay marriage".<ref name="albert-mohler">{{cite news |last1=Mohler |first1=R.

Harris emphasizes that all religions are not the same and that if any religion can be considered a "religion of peace", it is not Islam, but rather [[Jainism]],<ref name="Salon don"/><ref name ="Jains-Today"/><ref name="Sun-Sam"/> which emerged in India around the same time as Buddhism, and has non-violence as its core doctrine.<ref name="Sun-Sam"/> He underscores that to be a practicing Jain, one has to be a vegetarian and a pacifist, while the Jain monks even wear masks in order to avoid breathing in any living thing.<ref name="Sun-Sam"/><ref name ="Jains-Today"/> But, he points out that even the Jain religion has its problems, as Jains believe certain things based on insufficient evidence, which leads to some religious dogmas.<ref name="Sun-Sam"/>
 
Harris has often noted some positive aspects of [[Buddhist]] thought, especially in relation to meditation, such as [[Buddhism]]'s emphasis that one's behavior and intentions impact the mind, and in order to achieve happiness, one needs to strive towards "overcoming fear and hatred" while "maximizing love and compassion".<ref name="Sun-Sam"/> In 2019, while discussing his book ''Waking Up: Searching for Spirituality Without Religion,'' Harris noted that the West could learn a lot from the East about the traditions of meditation found in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]],<ref name="guardian-spiritual"/> though he considers that meditation can be practiced without any traditional religious beliefs.<ref name="Salon-Sam">{{cite magazine |date=December 6, 2014 |title=Mindfulness' 'truthiness' problem: Sam Harris, science and the truth about Buddhist tradition |last1=Purser |first1=Ronald |last2=Cooper |first2=Andrew | url=https://www.salon.com/2014/12/06/mindfulness_truthiness_problem_sam_harris_science_and_the_truth_about_buddhist_tradition/|magazine=Salon| access-date=July 2, 2024 }}</ref>

===Spirituality===

Harris holds that there is "nothing irrational about seeking the states of mind that lie at the core of many religions. Compassion, awe, devotion, and feelings of oneness are surely among the most valuable experiences a person can have", <ref name="newsweek.com" /> saying:<ref group=SH>{{cite web |last1=Harris |first1=Sam |title=God's Dupes |url=https://samharris.org/gods-dupes/ |website=SamHarris.org |access-date=10 April 2021 |date=15 March 2007}}</ref>

Harris rejects the dichotomy between [[spirituality]] and [[rationality]], favoring a middle path that preserves spirituality and science but does not involve religion.<ref name="clothier">{{cite web|last1=Clothier|first1=Peter|title=''Waking Up'', by Sam Harris: A Book Review|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/waking-up-by-sam-harris-a_b_8079028.html|work=Huffington Post|access-date=October 1, 2017|date=September 2, 2016}}</ref> He writes that spirituality should be understood in light of scientific disciplines like [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]].<ref name="clothier"/> Science, he contends, can show how to maximize human well-being, but may fail to answer certain questions about the nature of being, answers to some of which he says are discoverable directly through our experience.<ref name="clothier"/> His conception of spirituality does not involve a belief in any god.<ref name="h-smith">{{cite magazine|last1=Smith|first1=Holly|title=''Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion''|url=http://www.washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com/bookreview/executive-director-at-the-common-good|magazine=[[Washington Independent Review of Books]]|access-date=October 2, 2017|date=September 17, 2014}}</ref>

In ''[[Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion]]'' (2014), Harris describes his experience with [[Dzogchen]], a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] meditation practice, and recommends it to his readers.<ref name="clothier"/> He writes that the purpose of spirituality (as he defines it – he concedes that the term's uses are diverse and sometimes indefensible) is to become aware that our sense of self is illusory, and says this realization brings both happiness and insight into the nature of [[consciousness]], mirroring core Buddhist beliefs.<ref name="clothier"/><ref name="kirkus">{{cite journal |title=''Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion'' |journal=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=August 29, 2014 |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sam-harris/waking-up-guide-to-spirituality/ |access-date=August 12, 2016}}</ref> This process of realization, he argues, is based on experience and is not contingent on [[faith]].<ref name="clothier"/><ref name="guardian-spiritual"/>

===Science and morality===
{{See also|Science of morality}}

Harris considers that the [[well-being]] of conscious creatures forms the basis of morality. In ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', he argues that science can in principle answer moral questions and help maximize well-being.<ref name="Salon don"/>

Harris rejects the moral authority of religion, and points to what he sees as failures or misplaced priorities, for example saying that "The Catholic Church is more concerned about preventing contraception than preventing child rape".<ref name="Salon don" />

Harris also criticizes [[Cultural relativism|cultural]] and [[moral relativism]], arguing that it prevents people from making objective moral judgments about practices that clearly harm human well-being, such as [[female genital mutilation]]. Harris contends that we can make scientifically-based claims about the negative impacts of such practices on human welfare, and that withholding judgment in these cases is tantamount to claiming complete ignorance about what contributes to human well-being.<ref name="Salon don" />

===Free will===
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}
Harris says that the idea of [[free will]] "cannot be mapped on to any conceivable reality" and is incoherent.<ref name=pardi>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.philosophynews.com/post/2012/05/15/An-Analysis-of-Sam-Harris-Free-Will.aspx|title=An Analysis of Sam Harris' ''Free Will''|author=Paul Pardi|magazine=Philosophy News|date=May 15, 2012|access-date=April 17, 2016}}</ref> Harris writes in ''[[Free Will (book)|Free Will]]'' that neuroscience "reveals you to be a biochemical puppet."<ref>Nahmias, Eddy (August 13, 2012). [https://www.bigquestionsonline.com/content/does-contemporary-neuroscience-support-or-challenge-reality-free-will "Does Contemporary Neuroscience Support or Challenge the Reality of Free Will?"] Big Questions Online.</ref>

Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] argued that Harris's book ''Free Will'' successfully refuted the common understanding of free will, but that he failed to respond adequately to the [[compatibilist]] understanding of free will. Dennett said the book was valuable because it expressed the views of many eminent scientists, but that it nonetheless contained a "veritable museum of mistakes" and that "Harris and others need to do their homework if they want to engage with the best thought on the topic."<ref name="dennett-review">{{cite journal |last1=Dennett |first1=Daniel |date=2017 |title=Reflections on Sam Harris' ''Free Will'' |journal=Rivista internazionale di Filosofia e Psicologia |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=214–230 |doi=10.4453/rifp.2017.0018 |issn=2039-4667}}</ref>

===Artificial intelligence===
Harris is particularly concerned with [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|existential risks from artificial general intelligence]], a topic he has discussed in depth.<ref name="edge-ai">{{cite web |last1=Harris |first1=Sam |date=2015 |title=Can We Avoid a Digital Apocalypse? |url=https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26177 |access-date=14 June 2019 |website=Edge.org}}</ref><ref group=SH>{{Cite web |date=March 7, 2023 |title=#312 – The Trouble with AI |url=https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/312-the-trouble-with-ai |access-date=2023-08-12 |website=Sam Harris}}</ref><ref group=SH>{{Cite web |date=February 6, 2018 |title=#116 – AI: Racing Toward the Brink |url=https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/116-ai-racing-toward-brink |access-date=2023-08-12 |website=Sam Harris}}</ref> In a 2016 [[TED talk]], he argued that it will be a major threat in the future, and criticized the lack of human interest on the subject.<ref name="aitedtalk-davey">{{cite web |last1=Davey |first1=Tucker |date=October 7, 2016 |title=Sam Harris TED Talk: Can We Build AI Without Losing Control Over It? |url=https://futureoflife.org/2016/10/07/sam-harris-ted-talk/?cn-reloaded=1 |access-date=14 June 2019 |website=Future of Life Institute}}</ref> He said that [[artificial superintelligence]] will inevitably be developed if three assumptions hold true: intelligence is a product of information processing in physical systems, humans will continue to improve intelligent machines, and human intelligence is far from the peak of possible intelligence.<ref name="aitedtalk-davey" /> He described making [[AI alignment|artificial superintelligence safe]] as "one of the greatest challenges our species will ever face", indicating that it would warrant immediate consideration.<ref name="aitedtalk-davey" />

== Political views ==
Harris describes himself as a liberal, even though he criticizes some aspects of both right and left. He is a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]<ref>{{cite episode |series=[[The David Pakman Show]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCKKCglmQAw| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/PCKKCglmQAw| archive-date=2021-10-30|title=Sam Harris: Trump, Reparations, Manifestos, Fox News|date=September 9, 2019|access-date=November 21, 2019 |time=03:50 |quote=I'm a registered Democrat}}{{cbignore}}</ref> and has never voted [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in presidential elections.<ref name=":0" /> He supports [[same-sex marriage]] and [[Drug liberalization|decriminalizing drugs]].<ref name="laharris" /> 

=== Criticism of the Bush Administration ===
Harris frequently criticized [[George W. Bush]] over his support for [[intelligent design]] and his coziness with [[Christianity]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=comerj |date=2007-01-05 |title=January 5, 2007 ~ Sam Harris Extended Interview {{!}} January 5, 2007 {{!}} Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly {{!}} PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2007/01/05/january-5-2007-sam-harris-extended-interview/3736/ |access-date=2024-10-23 |website=Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Sam Harris {{!}} Home of the Making Sense Podcast |url=https://www.samharris.org/blog/the-politics-of-ignorance |access-date=2024-10-23 |website=Sam Harris}}</ref>

In an op-ed for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2006, Harris said that he supported most of the criticism against the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s [[war in Iraq]], and all criticism of fiscal policy and the administration's treatment of science. Harris also said that liberalism has grown "dangerously out of touch with the realities of our world" regarding threats posed by [[Islamic fundamentalism]].<ref name="laharris">Harris, Sam (September 18, 2006).

=== Israel ===
Harris opposes religious claims to Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]]. Nonetheless, Harris has said that due to the hostility towards Jews, if there is one religious group which needs protections in the form of a state, it is Jews and the state of Israel.<ref group="SH" name="#2 — Why Don't I Criticize Israel">{{Cite web |date=July 27, 2014 |title=#2 — Why Don't I Criticize Israel? |url=https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/why-dont-i-criticize-israel |access-date=2023-04-13 |website=Sam Harris}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |author=Salon Staff |date=2014-07-28 |title=Sam Harris: Why don't I criticize Israel? |url=https://www.salon.com/2014/07/28/sam_harris_why_dont_i_criticize_israel/ |access-date=2023-04-13 |magazine=Salon |language=en}}</ref>

Harris has criticized both Israel and Palestine for committing war crimes in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. He said in 2014 that he believes Israel genuinely wants peace and that its neighbors are more devoted to the destruction of Israel. Harris has also said that Palestine is more guilty, citing [[Hamas]]' use of human shields and genocidal rhetoric towards the Jews.<ref group="SH" name="#2 — Why Don't I Criticize Israel"/> He names these as reasons that Israel has a right to defend itself against Palestine.<ref group=SH>{{Cite web |date=August 12, 2014 |title=Making Sense of Gaza {{!}} A Conversation Between Sam Harris and Andrew Sullivan |url=https://www.samharris.org/blog/making-sense-of-gaza |access-date=2023-04-13 |website=Sam Harris}}</ref>

During the [[Israel–Hamas war]] that began in October 2023, Harris expressed support for Israel and rejected arguments that Israel provoked Hamas by building [[Israeli settlement]]s in the West Bank, arguing that Gaza had not been occupied since 2005. He also condemned the [[2023 Hamas attack on Israel]], which led to the war.<ref group=SH>{{Cite web |title=The Sin of Moral Equivalence |url=https://www.samharris.org/blog/the-sin-of-moral-equivalence |access-date=2023-11-04 |website=Sam Harris}}</ref>

=== Economics ===
Harris supports raising taxes on the wealthy and reducing government spending, and has criticized billionaires like [[Bill Gates]] and [[Warren Buffett]] for paying relatively little in tax. He has proposed taxing 10% for estates worth above 10 million, taxing 50% for estates worth over a billion dollars, and then using the money to fund an infrastructure bank.<ref group="SH" name="too-rich"/>

He has accused conservatives of perceiving raising taxes as a form of theft or punishment, and of believing that by being rich they create value for others.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2006-11-01 |title=Head-in-the-Sand Liberals |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-harris18sep18,0,1897169.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail |access-date=2023-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101084519/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-harris18sep18,0,1897169.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail |archive-date=November 1, 2006 }}</ref><ref group="SH" name="too-rich"/> He has described this view as ludicrous, saying that "[[Free market|markets]] aren't perfectly reflective of the value of goods and services, and many wealthy people don't create much in the way of value for others.

=== Gun rights ===
Harris owns guns and wrote in 2015 that he understood people's hostility towards [[gun culture in the United States]] and the political influence of the [[National Rifle Association of America]]. However, he argued that there is a rational case for gun ownership due to the fact that the police cannot always be relied on and that guns are a good alternative.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Why I own guns |url=https://theweek.com/articles/468420/why-guns |access-date=2022-05-31 |work=The Week |language=en-US |date=January 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514023734/https://theweek.com/articles/468420/why-guns |archive-date=May 14, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref group="SH" name="riddle">{{Cite web |title=The Riddle of the Gun |url=https://www.samharris.org/blog/the-riddle-of-the-gun |access-date=2023-03-14 |website=Sam Harris |date=2013-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211126024809/https://www.samharris.org/blog/the-riddle-of-the-gun |archive-date=2021-11-26 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Harris has stated that he disagrees with proposals by liberals and gun control advocates for restricting guns, such as the [[Assault weapons ban (USA)|assault weapons ban]], since more gun crimes are committed with handguns than the semi-automatic weapons which the ban would target. Harris has also said that the left-wing media gets many things wrong about guns. He has, however, offered support for certain regulations on gun ownership, such as mandatory training, licensure, and background checks before a gun can be legally purchased.<ref group="SH" name="riddle"/>

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], he criticized commentators for pushing views on COVID-19 that he considered to be "patently insane". Harris accused these commentators of believing that COVID-19 policies were a way of implementing social control and to crackdown on people's freedom politically.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=2021-12-15 |title=Sam Harris Blasts Podcasters Pushing Covid Conspiracies |url=https://www.mediaite.com/podcasts/patently-insane-sam-harris-blasts-fellow-podcasters-pushing-covid-conspiracy-theories/ |access-date=2023-03-14 |magazine=Mediaite |language=en}}</ref> Harris has feuded with [[Bret Weinstein]] over his views on COVID-19.<ref>{{Cite news |title=I tried to talk about the hard issues America faces.

=== Intellectual dark web ===
Harris has been described, alongside others such as [[Joe Rogan]], [[Bret Weinstein]], and [[Jordan Peterson]], as a member of the [[intellectual dark web]], a group that opposes political correctness and identity politics.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2020-01-31 |title=Opinion {{!}} Meet the Renegades of the Intellectual Dark Web  |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/intellectual-dark-web.html |access-date=2022-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131000213/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/intellectual-dark-web.html |archive-date=January 31, 2020 |last1=Weiss |first1=Bari |last2=Winter |first2=Damon}}</ref> ''New York Times'' book reviewer [[Bari Weiss]] described the group as "a collection of iconoclastic thinkers, academic renegades and media personalities who are having a rolling conversation – on podcasts, YouTube and Twitter, and in sold-out auditoriums – that sound unlike anything else happening, at least publicly, in the culture right now."<ref name="Weiss" />

In November 2020, Harris stated that he does not identify as a part of that group.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="republic" /> In 2021 Harris stated that he had "turn[ed] in [his] imaginary membership card to this imaginary organization".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wakeling |first=Adam |date=2021-07-01 |title=What Happened to the Intellectual Dark Web?|url=https://www.realclearpolicy.com/2021/07/01/what_happened_to_the_intellectual_dark_web_783679.html |access-date=2022-05-08 |website=RealClearPolicy |language=en}}</ref> In 2023 during an interview with ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', Harris explained that he had broken away from the intellectual dark web due to disagreements with Bret Weinstein, and [[Maajid Nawaz]]'s "obsession" with COVID-19 conspiracy theories and criticism of COVID-19 policies. He also described becoming disenchanted with [[Dave Rubin]] for having been captured by his audience and said "Rubin became far more cynical than I would have thought possible. And it's very depressing. He was a friend, he's not a friend anymore".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Fisher |first=Anthony L. |date=2023-01-19 |title=The Intellectual Dark Web's Descent Into Paranoia and Trumpism |language=en |work=The Daily Beast |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/intellectual-dark-webs-descent-into-paranoia-and-trumpism |access-date=2023-10-31}}</ref>

==Controversies==
{{Criticism section|date=November 2023}}

=== Race and IQ controversy ===
In April 2017, Harris hosted the social scientist [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]] on his podcast, discussing topics including the [[heritability of IQ]] and [[race and intelligence]].<ref group="SH" name="harris-ekeal">{{cite web |last1=Harris |first1=Sam |date=27 March 2018 |title=Ezra Klein: Editor-at-Large |url=https://samharris.org/ezra-klein-editor-chief/ |access-date=16 October 2018 |website=SamHarris.org}}</ref> Harris stated the invitation was out of indignation at a violent protest against Murray at [[Middlebury College]] the month before and not out of particular interest in the material at hand.<ref group="SH" name="harris-ekeal"/> The podcast episode garnered significant criticism, most notably from ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]''<ref name="vox-thn" /><ref name="vox-klein">{{cite news |last1=Klein |first1=Ezra |author-link=Ezra Klein |date=27 March 2018 |title=Sam Harris, Charles Murray, and the allure of race science |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/27/15695060/sam-harris-charles-murray-race-iq-forbidden-knowledge-podcast-bell-curve |access-date=16 October 2018}}</ref> and ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.<ref name="slate-iq">{{cite news |last1=Saletan |first1=William |author-link=William Saletan |date=27 April 2018 |title=Stop Talking About Race and IQ |agency=Slate |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/04/stop-talking-about-race-and-iq-take-it-from-someone-who-did.html |access-date=17 October 2018}}</ref> In the ''Vox'' article, scientists, including [[Eric Turkheimer]], [[Kathryn Paige Harden]], and [[Richard E.

Harris opposed [[Executive Order 13769]], which limited the entry of refugees from Muslim-majority countries to the United States, stating that it was “unethical with regard to the plight of refugees…and bound to be ineffective in stopping the spread of [[Islamism]].”<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harris |first=Sam |date=January 29, 2017 |title=A Few Thoughts On The Muslim Ban |url=https://www.samharris.org/blog/a-few-thoughts-on-the-muslim-ban |access-date=August 15, 2024 |website=Sam Harris.org}}</ref>

In 2018, [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]], a visiting professor of science and religion at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]], published an article in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' criticizing Harris, whom he described as "annoying" and "deluded". Wright wrote that Harris, despite claiming to be a champion of rationality, ignored his own [[cognitive bias]]es and engaged in faulty and inconsistent arguments in his book ''The End of Faith''. He wrote that "the famous proponent of New Atheism is on a crusade against tribalism but seems oblivious to his own version of it." Wright wrote that these biases are rooted in [[natural selection]] and impact everyone, but that they can be mitigated when acknowledged.<ref name="wright-wired" />
