Mathematics was paramount to his method of inquiry, and he connected the previously separate fields of [[geometry]]   and [[algebra]] into [[analytic geometry]]. Descartes spent much of his working life in the [[Dutch Republic]], initially serving the [[Dutch States Army]], and later becoming a central intellectual of the [[Dutch Golden Age]].<ref>[[Steven Nadler|Nadler, Steven]]. 2015.

Many elements of Descartes' philosophy have precedents in late [[Aristotelianism]], the [[Neostoicism|revived Stoicism]] of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. In his [[natural philosophy]], he differed from the [[Scholasticism|schools]] on two major points. First, he rejected the splitting of [[Matter|corporeal substance]] into [[matter]] and form; second, he rejected any appeal to [[Teleology|final ends]], divine or natural, in explaining natural phenomena.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R. |title=Physiology of Behavior |publisher=Pearson: Allyn & Bacon |year=2001 |location=Needham Heights, Massachusetts |page=8 |isbn=978-0-205-30840-8 }}</ref> In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of [[Creationism|God's act of creation]]. Refusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers, Descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him. In the opening section of the ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'', an [[Early modern period|early modern]] treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic "as if no one had written on these matters before." His best known philosophical statement is "{{langx|la|link=no|[[cogito, ergo sum]]|label=none}}" ("I think, therefore I am"; {{langx|fr|link=no|Je pense, donc je suis}}), found in ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' (1637, in French and Latin, 1644) and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644, in Latin, 1647 in French).{{NoteTag|This idea had already been proposed by [[Spanish philosophy|Spanish philosopher]] [[Gómez Pereira]] a hundred years ago in the form: "I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist" (''nosco me aliquid noscere, & quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum''). {{Bulleted list|Pereira, Gómez. 1749 [1554].

Descartes has often been called the father of modern philosophy, and is largely seen as responsible for the increased attention given to [[epistemology]] in the 17th century.<ref name="Russell2004p516">[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&pg=PA516 ''History of western philosophy''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816214227/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&pg=PA516 |date=16 August 2021 }} pp. 511, 516–17.</ref>{{NoteTag|See also: [[wikt:epistemological turn|Epistemological turn]].}} He laid the foundation for 17th-century continental [[rationalism]], later advocated by [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and was later opposed by the [[empiricist]] school of thought consisting of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[David Hume|Hume]]. The rise of early modern rationalism—as a systematic school of philosophy in its own right for the first time in history—exerted an influence on modern [[Western philosophy|Western thought]] in general, with the birth of two rationalistic philosophical systems of Descartes ([[Cartesianism]]) and Spinoza ([[Spinozism]]). It was the 17th-century arch-rationalists like Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz who have given the "[[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]]" its name and place in history. Leibniz, Spinoza,<ref>Moorman, R. H. 1943.

Descartes' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641) continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes' influence in mathematics is equally apparent, being the namesake of the [[Cartesian coordinate system]]. He is credited as the father of analytic geometry—used in the discovery of infinitesimal [[calculus]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Descartes was also one of the key figures in the [[Scientific Revolution]].

=== Career ===
==== France ====
In 1620, Descartes left the army. He visited [[Basilica della Santa Casa]] in Loreto, then visited various countries before returning to France, and during the next few years, he spent time in Paris. It was there that he composed his first essay on method: ''Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii'' (''[[Rules for the Direction of the Mind]]'').<ref name="Durandin"/> He arrived in [[The Hague|La Haye]] in 1623, selling all of his property to invest in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], which provided a comfortable income for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Gaukroger|1995|page=132}}<ref name=":8" />{{Rp|94}} Descartes was present at the [[siege of La Rochelle]] by [[Cardinal Richelieu]] in 1627 as an observer.<ref name=":8">Shea, William R. 1991.

Descartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life. In 1641, he published a metaphysics treatise, ''Meditationes de Prima Philosophia'' (''Meditations on First Philosophy''), written in Latin and thus addressed to the learned. It was followed in 1644 by ''Principia Philosophiae'' (''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''), a kind of synthesis of the ''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Meditations on First Philosophy''. In 1643, Cartesian philosophy was condemned at the [[Utrecht University|University of Utrecht]], and Descartes was obliged to flee to the Hague, settling in [[Egmond-Binnen]].

A French translation of ''Principia Philosophiae'', prepared by Abbot Claude Picot, was published in 1647. This edition was also dedicated to Princess Elisabeth. In [[Principles of Philosophy#Preface to the French edition|the preface to the French edition]], Descartes praised true philosophy as a means to attain wisdom.

{{Further|Cartesianism}}

In his ''Discourse on the Method'', he attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt. To achieve this, he employs a method called hyperbolical/metaphysical doubt, also sometimes referred to as methodological skepticism or [[Cartesian doubt]]: he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then re-establishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge.<ref>{{cite web|last=Copenhaver|first=Rebecca|title=Forms of skepticism|url=http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050108095032/http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html|archive-date=8 January 2005|access-date=15 August 2007}}</ref> Descartes built his ideas from scratch which he does in ''The Meditations on First Philosophy''. He relates this to architecture: the top soil is taken away to create a new building or structure. Descartes calls his doubt the soil and new knowledge the buildings. To Descartes, Aristotle's [[foundationalism]] is incomplete and his method of doubt enhances foundationalism.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Newman|first=Lex|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/descartes-epistemology/|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year=2016|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016|access-date=22 February 2017|archive-date=8 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308011100/https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/descartes-epistemology/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Initially, Descartes arrives at only a single first principle: he thinks. This is expressed in the Latin phrase in ''the Discourse on Method'' "[[Cogito, ergo sum]]" (English: "I think, therefore I am").<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cogito, ergo sum {{!}} philosophy|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/cogito-ergo-sum|access-date=28 July 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=16 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616100526/https://www.britannica.com/topic/cogito-ergo-sum|url-status=live}}</ref> Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting; therefore, the very fact that he doubted proved his existence. "The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten books: Chosen by Raj Persuade|publisher=The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]]|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/181/3/258|access-date=13 November 2007|archive-date=10 November 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031110060925/http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/181/3/258|url-status=live}}</ref> These two first principles—I think and I exist—were later confirmed by Descartes' clear and distinct perception (delineated in his Third Meditation from ''The Meditations''): as he clearly and distinctly perceives these two principles, Descartes reasoned, ensures their indubitability.

Descartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form? He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however, these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a ''thinking thing''. Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines "thought" (''[[List of Latin phrases (C)|cogitatio]]'') as "what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it". Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately [[Consciousness|conscious]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Descartes|first=René|title=The Principles of Philosophy|year=1644|volume=IX}}</ref> He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from [[dream argument|dreams]], and that one's mind cannot have been "hijacked" by an [[evil demon]] placing an illusory external world before one's senses.<ref name=":0" />

Humans are a union of mind and body;<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=277}}</ref> thus Descartes' dualism embraced the idea that mind and body are distinct but closely joined. While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp, he thought it was entirely straightforward. Descartes employed the concept of ''modes'', which are the ways in which substances exist. In ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'', Descartes explained, "we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot, conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance". To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction,<ref name="David Cunning 2014 278">{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=278}}</ref> which Descartes explained as follows:

<blockquote>The intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention. Thus, when I consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is, I make a mental abstraction.<ref name="David Cunning 2014 278"/>
</blockquote>

According to Descartes, two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other. Thus, Descartes reasoned that God is distinct from humans, and the body and mind of a human are also distinct from one another.<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=279}}</ref> He argued that the great differences between body (an extended thing) and mind (an un-extended, immaterial thing) make the two [[Ontology|ontologically]] distinct. According to Descartes' indivisibility argument, the mind is utterly indivisible: because "when I consider the mind, or myself in so far as I am merely a thinking thing, I am unable to distinguish any part within myself; I understand myself to be something quite single and complete."<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=280}}</ref>

Moreover, in The ''Meditations'', Descartes discusses a piece of [[wax]] and exposes the single most characteristic doctrine of Cartesian dualism: that the universe contained two radically different kinds of substances—the mind or soul defined as [[Thought|thinking]], and the body defined as matter and unthinking.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=86}}</ref> The [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] of Descartes' days held that the universe was inherently purposeful or teleological. Everything that happened, be it the motion of the [[star]]s or the growth of a [[tree]], was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose, goal or end that worked its way out within nature. Aristotle called this the "final cause", and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated. Descartes' theory of dualism supports the distinction between traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and Galileo, which denied the role of a divine power and "final causes" in its attempts to explain nature. Descartes' dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter by expelling the final cause from the physical universe (or ''res extensa'') in favor of the mind (or ''res cogitans''). Therefore, while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern [[physics]], it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the [[soul]].<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=87}}</ref>

Descartes' dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings. A human was, according to Descartes, a composite entity of mind and body. Descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body, but the body could not exist without the mind. In The ''Meditations'', Descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance, the body is composed only of "accidents".<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=301}}</ref> But he did argue that mind and body are closely joined:<ref name="Georges Dicker 2013 303">{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=303}}</ref>

<blockquote>Nature also teaches me, by the sensations of pain, hunger, thirst and so on, that I am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship, but that I am very closely joined and, as it were, intermingled with it, so that I and the body form a unit. If this were not so, I, who am nothing but a thinking thing, would not feel pain when the body was hurt, but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect, just as a sailor perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken.<ref name="Georges Dicker 2013 303"/>

Descartes' discussion on embodiment raised one of the most perplexing problems of his dualism philosophy: What exactly is the relationship of union between the mind and the body of a person?<ref name="Georges Dicker 2013 303"/> Therefore, Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the [[mind–body problem]] for many years after Descartes' death.<ref>Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (online): Descartes and the Pineal Gland.</ref> Descartes was also a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and believed in the power of [[Innatism|innate ideas]].<ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 88">{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=88}}</ref> Descartes argued the theory of innate knowledge and that all humans were born with knowledge through the higher power of God.

In ''The Passions of the Soul'', published in 1649,<ref>{{Cite web|title=17th and 18th Century Theories of Emotions > Descartes on the Emotions (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotions-17th18th/LD2Descartes.html#PasMedFre|access-date=29 July 2021|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-date=3 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903001831/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotions-17th18th/LD2Descartes.html#PasMedFre|url-status=live}}</ref> Descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits. These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles. These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul, or passions of the soul. Descartes distinguished six basic passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness. All of these passions, he argued, represented different combinations of the original spirit, and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions. He argued, for example, that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body. In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body, he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the [[pineal gland]] as connector.<ref>{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=86}}</ref> Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland, through animal spirits. Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits. He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on God's will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them. But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland, thus humans had to learn how to control their passions.<ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 87">{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=87}}</ref>

Descartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events, which influenced 19th-century [[reflex]] theory. He argued that external motions, such as touch and sound, reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits. For example, heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions, with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system, and in turn, animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire.<ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 87"/> Through this chain of reactions, the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process.<ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 88"/>

Above all, he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was [[Divinity|divine]], thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Goudriaan |first=Aza |date=3 September 2020 |title=The Concept of Heresy and the Debates on Descartes' Philosophy |url=https://brill.com/view/journals/chrc/100/2-3/article-p172_4.xml |journal=Church History and Religious Culture |volume=100 |issue=2–3 |pages=172–86 |doi=10.1163/18712428-10002001 |s2cid=225257956 |issn=1871-241X |access-date=14 March 2022 |archive-date=14 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220314131104/https://brill.com/view/journals/chrc/100/2-3/article-p172_4.xml |url-status=live |doi-access=free }}</ref> Descartes' writings went on to form the basis for theories on [[emotion]]s and how [[Cognition|cognitive]] evaluations were translated into affective processes.

=== Moral philosophy ===
For Descartes, [[ethics]] was a science, the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics.<ref name="Preface"/> In this way, he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind–body dualism, and defends [[free will]]. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that individuals should seek, and [[virtue]] consists in the correct reasoning that should guide their actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge and mental condition. For this reason, he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body.<ref>Pickavé, M., & [[Lisa Shapiro|Shapiro, L.]], eds., ''Emotion and Cognitive Life in Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oDZpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189 p. 189] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816214236/https://books.google.com/books?id=oDZpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189 |date=16 August 2021 }}.</ref>{{rp|189}} He discussed this subject in the correspondence with [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], and as a result wrote his work ''The Passions of the Soul'', that contains a study of the [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions.<ref name="Blom">Blom, John J., Descartes.

Descartes and [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] both identified [[summum bonum|sovereign goods]] with virtue. For [[Epicurus]], the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that, in fact, this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that [[Eudaimonia|happiness (eudaimonia)]] depends on both moral virtue and also on the goods of fortune such as a moderate degree of wealth, Descartes does not deny that fortunes contributes to happiness, but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.<ref name="Blom"/> The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his ''Discourse on the Method'', he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. Those maxims are known as his [[Discourse on the Method#Part III: Morals, and Maxims accepted while conducting Method|"Provisional Morals"]].

=== Religion ===
{{Catholic philosophy}}
In the third and fifth ''Meditation'', Descartes offers [[Proof (truth)|proofs]] of a benevolent God (the [[trademark argument]] and the [[ontological argument#René Descartes|ontological argument]] respectively). Descartes has faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, since he believed that God provided him with a working mind and [[Sensory nervous system|sensory system]] and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, Descartes finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction and perception. Regarding [[epistemology]], therefore, Descartes can be said to have contributed such ideas as a conception of foundationalism and the possibility that [[reason]] is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. Descartes, however, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.<ref name="Preface"/>

Descartes invokes his [[causal adequacy principle]]<ref>[[Georges Dicker|Dicker, G.]], ''Descartes: An Analytical and Historical Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UohoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT138 pp. 118ff] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816214233/https://books.google.com/books?id=UohoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT138 |date=16 August 2021 }}.</ref> to support his trademark argument for the existence of God, quoting Lucretius in defence: ''"Ex nihilo nihil fit"'', meaning "[[Creation ex materia|Nothing comes from nothing]]" ([[Lucretius]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Carus|first=Lucretius|title=De Rerum Natura|date=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=146–482|author-link=Lucretius}}</ref> ''Oxford Reference'' summarises the argument, as follows, "that our idea of perfection is related to its perfect origin (God), just as a stamp or trademark is left in an article of workmanship by its maker."<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Trademark argument|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803105212460|access-date=29 July 2021|journal=Oxford Reference|language=en|archive-date=23 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023105416/https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803105212460|url-status=live}}</ref> In the fifth Meditation, Descartes presents a version of the ontological argument which is founded on the possibility of thinking the "idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite," and suggests that "of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct."<ref>Descartes, Rene "Meditations on First Philosophy, 3rd Ed., Translated from Latin by: Donald A. Cress</ref>

Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic,<ref name="books.google.be" /><ref name="KrR-5EKLSQMC p. 207" /><ref name="Gh_BAAAQBAJ p. 107" /> and one of the purposes of the ''Meditations'' was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time. [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] regarded Descartes' views as a rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of [[deism]]: "I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God," while a powerful contemporary, [[Martin Schoock]], accused him of [[Atheism|atheist]] beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his ''Meditations''. The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663.<ref name="Descartes, René 2009">Descartes, René. (2009). ''Encyclopædia Britannica 2009 Deluxe Edition''.

Descartes also wrote a response to [[Philosophical skepticism|external world skepticism]]. Through this method of skepticism, he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words, certainty. He argues that sensory [[perception]]s come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to argue that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the "propensity" to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true "substance". But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/|title=Descartes, Rene {{!}} Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=22 February 2017|archive-date=1 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101020931/http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Descartes steered clear of theological questions, restricting his attention to showing that there is no incompatibility between his metaphysics and theological orthodoxy. He avoided trying to demonstrate theological dogmas metaphysically. When challenged that he had not established the immortality of the soul merely in showing that the soul and the body are distinct substances, he replied, "I do not take it upon myself to try to use the power of human reason to settle any of those matters which depend on the free will of God."{{sfn|Gaukroger|1995|page=355–56}}

Descartes "invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', and knowns by ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''".

=== Analytic geometry ===
{{Main|Analytic geometry}}
{{See also|Equation#Analytic geometry|Algebraic geometry#History}}[[File:Cartesian coordinates 2D.svg|thumb|A Cartesian coordinates graph, using his invented ''x'' and ''y'' axes]]

One of Descartes' most enduring legacies was his development of Cartesian or [[analytic geometry]], which uses algebra to describe geometry; the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is named after him. He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in the system of knowledge, using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning, particularly about abstract, unknown quantities.<ref>[[Stephen Gaukroger|Gaukroger, S.]], "The nature of abstract reasoning: philosophical aspects of Descartes' work in algebra", in [[John Cottingham|J. Cottingham]], ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Descartes'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Prhr9FBdQ_MC&pg=PA91 pp. 91–114] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816214237/https://books.google.com/books?id=Prhr9FBdQ_MC&pg=PA91|date=16 August 2021}}.</ref>{{rp|91–114}} European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli]], [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardano]], [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and [[Lodovico Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Equations of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity ''a<sup>2</sup>'' could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians such as [[François Viète]], who insisted that a second power must represent an area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in envisioning a more general science of algebra or "universal mathematics", as a precursor to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.<ref>[[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'', Vol. 1 (1972).

=== Influence on Newton's mathematics ===
Current popular opinion holds that Descartes had the most influence of anyone on the young [[Isaac Newton]], and this is arguably one of his most important contributions. Descartes' influence extended not directly from his original French edition of ''La Géométrie'', however, but rather from [[Frans van Schooten]]'s expanded second Latin edition of the work.<ref>[[Richard S. Westfall|Westfall, R. S.]], ''Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ngEugMMa9YC&pg=PT100 p. 100] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816214236/https://books.google.com/books?id=3ngEugMMa9YC&pg=PT100|date=16 August 2021}}.</ref>{{rp|100}} Newton continued Descartes' work on [[cubic equation]]s, which freed the subject from fetters of the Greek perspectives. The most important concept was his very modern treatment of single variables.<ref>Whiteside, D. T., "Newton the Mathematician", in Z. Bechler, ed., ''Contemporary Newtonian Research'' (Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer, 1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LP3nCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA109 pp. 109–29] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816214228/https://books.google.de/books?id=LP3nCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA109|date=16 August 2021}}.</ref>{{rp|109–129}}

==== The basis of calculus ====
Descartes' work provided the basis for the [[calculus]] developed by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], who applied the infinitesimal calculus to the [[Tangent#Analytical approach|tangent line problem]], thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gullberg |first=Jan |url=https://archive.org/details/mathematicsfromb1997gull |title=Mathematics From The Birth of Numbers |publisher=W.W.

== Physics ==

=== Philosophy, metaphysics, and physics ===
Descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the [[natural science]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grosholz |first=Emily |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2EtAVLU1eIAC&pg=PA1 |title=Cartesian method and the problem of reduction |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-19-824250-5 |quote=But contemporary debate has tended to...understand [Cartesian method] merely as the 'method of doubt'...I want to define Descartes' method in broader terms...to trace its impact on the domains of mathematics and [[physics]] as well as [[metaphysics]]. |author-link=Emily Grosholz |access-date=24 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816214244/https://books.google.com/books?id=2EtAVLU1eIAC&pg=PA1 |archive-date=16 August 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> For him, philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge, as he related in a letter to a French translator:<ref name="Preface" />
{{blockquote|Thus, all Philosophy is like a tree, of which Metaphysics is the root, Physics the trunk, and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk, which are reduced to three principals, namely, Medicine, Mechanics, and Ethics.

=== Mechanics ===

==== Mechanical philosophy ====
{{Main|Mechanism (philosophy)#Mechanical philosophy}}{{See also|#Army service|Corpuscularianism}}
The beginning to Descartes' interest in physics is accredited to the amateur scientist and mathematician [[Isaac Beeckman]], whom he met in 1618, and who was at the forefront of a new school of thought known as [[mechanical philosophy]]. With this foundation of reasoning, Descartes formulated many of his theories on [[Geometric mechanics|mechanical and geometric physics]].<ref name="Slowik">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Descartes' Physics |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Archive |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/descartes-physics/ |access-date=1 October 2018 |last=Slowik |first=Edward |date=22 August 2017 |editor=Edward N.

Descartes asked Beeckman to translate the problem from Dutch to French.{{sfn|Gaukroger|1995|page=Chapter 3}} In their following meetings Beeckman interested Descartes in his corpuscularian approach to mechanical theory, and convinced him to devote his studies to a mathematical approach to nature.<ref name="porter" />{{sfn|Gaukroger|1995|page=Chapter 3}} In 1628, Beeckman also introduced him to many of [[Galileo]]'s ideas.<ref name="porter">Harold J. Cook, in ''The Scientific Revolution in National Context'', [[Roy Porter]], [[Mikuláš Teich]], (eds.), Cambridge University Press, 1992, pages 127–129</ref> Together, they worked on [[free fall]], [[catenary|catenaries]], [[conic section]]s, and [[fluid statics]]. Both believed that it was necessary to create a method that thoroughly linked mathematics and physics.<ref name="Durandin" />

==== Anticipating the concept of work ====

=== Optics ===
Descartes also made contributions to the field of [[optics]]. He showed by using geometric construction and the [[law of refraction]] (also known as Descartes' law, or more commonly [[Snell's law]] outside France) that the angular radius of a [[rainbow]] is 42 degrees (i.e., the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow's centre is 42°).<ref>{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=P.A. and G.

== Meteorology ==
Within ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', there is an appendix in which Descartes discusses his theories on [[Meteorology]] known as ''Les Météores''. He first proposed the idea that the elements were made up of small particles that join together imperfectly, thus leaving small spaces in between. These spaces were then filled with smaller much quicker "subtile matter".<ref name=":02">{{Cite book |last=Frisinger |first=H.

The size of the particle also matters; if the particle was smaller, not only was it faster and constantly moving, it was more easily agitated by the larger particles, which were slow but had more force. The different qualities, such as combinations and shapes, gave rise to different secondary qualities of materials, such as temperature.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book |last=Martin |first=Craig |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794700393 |title=Renaissance meteorology : Pomponazzi to Descartes |date=2011 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-1-4214-0244-4 |location=Baltimore |oclc=794700393}}</ref> This first idea is the basis for the rest of Descartes' theory on Meteorology.

While rejecting most of [[Aristotle]]'s theories on Meteorology, he still kept some of the terminology that Aristotle used such as vapors and exhalations. These "vapors" would be drawn into the sky by the sun from "terrestrial substances" and would generate wind.<ref name=":02" /> Descartes also theorized that falling clouds would displace the air below them, also generating wind. Falling clouds could also generate thunder. He theorized that when a cloud rests above another cloud and the air around the top cloud is hot, it condenses the vapor around the top cloud, and causes the particles to fall. When the particles falling from the top cloud collided with the bottom cloud's particles it would create thunder.<ref name=":12" /> He compared his theory on thunder to his theory on avalanches. Descartes believed that the booming sound that avalanches created, was due to snow that was heated, and therefore heavier, falling onto the snow that was below it.<ref name=":12" /> This theory was supported by experience "It follows that one can understand why it thunders more rarely in winter than in summer; for then not enough heat reaches the highest clouds, in order to break them up."<ref name=":12" />

Another theory that Descartes had was on the production of lightning. Descartes believed that lightning was caused by exhalations trapped between the two colliding clouds. He believed that in order to make these exhalations viable to produce lightning, they had to be made "fine and inflammable" by hot and dry weather.<ref name=":12" /> Whenever the clouds would collide, it would cause them to ignite, creating lightning; if the cloud above was heavier than the bottom cloud, it would also produce thunder.

Descartes also believed that clouds were made up of drops of water and ice, and believed that rain would fall whenever the air could no longer support them. It would fall as snow if the air was not warm enough to melt the raindrops. And hail was when the cloud drops would melt, and then freeze again because cold air would refreeze them.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":12" />

Descartes did not use mathematics or instruments (as there were not any at the time) to back up his theories on Meteorology and instead used qualitative reasoning in order to deduce his hypothesis.<ref name=":02" />

==Historical impact==
===Emancipation from Church doctrine===
[[File:DescartesMeditations.png|thumb|Cover of ''Meditations'']]

Descartes has often been dubbed the father of modern [[Western philosophy]], the thinker whose approaches has profoundly changed the course of Western philosophy and set the basis for [[modernity]].<ref name="Russell2004p516"/><ref>Heidegger [1938] (2002), p. 76 "Descartes... that which he himself founded... modern (and that means, at the same time, Western) metaphysics."</ref> The first two of his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', those that formulate the famous methodic doubt, represent the portion of Descartes' writings that most influenced modern thinking.<ref>[[Tad Schmaltz|Schmaltz, Tad M.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=pIYcUBCOrNgC&pg=PA27 ''Radical Cartesianism: The French Reception of Descartes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816214240/https://books.google.com/books?id=pIYcUBCOrNgC&pg=PA27 |date=16 August 2021 }} p. 27 quotation: {{blockquote|The Descartes most familiar to twentieth-century philosophers is the Descartes of the first two ''Meditations'', someone preoccupied with hyperbolic doubt of the material world and the certainty of knowledge of the self that emerges from the famous cogito argument.}}</ref> It has been argued that Descartes himself did not realize the extent of this revolutionary move.<ref>[[Roy Wood Sellars]] (1949) [https://archive.org/details/philosophyforfut00sell ''Philosophy for the future: the quest of modern materialism''] "Husserl has taken Descartes very seriously in a historical as well as in a systematic sense [...] [in ''The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology'', Husserl] finds in the first two Meditations of Descartes a depth which it is difficult to fathom, and which Descartes himself was so little able to appreciate that he let go "the great discovery" he had in his hands."</ref> In shifting the debate from "what is true" to "of what can I be certain?", Descartes arguably shifted the authoritative guarantor of truth from God to humanity (even though Descartes himself claimed he received his visions from God)—while the traditional concept of "truth" implies an external authority, "certainty" instead relies on the judgment of the individual.

In an [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] revolution, the human being is now raised to the level of a subject, an agent, an [[Emancipation|emancipated]] being equipped with autonomous reason. This was a revolutionary step that established the basis of modernity, the repercussions of which are still being felt: the emancipation of humanity from Christian [[revelation]]al truth and [[Catholic Church|Church doctrine]]; humanity making its own law and taking its own stand.<ref name="Heidegger1938emancipated">[[Martin Heidegger]] [1938] (2002) ''[[The Age of the World Picture]]'' quotation: {{blockquote|For up to Descartes...a particular ''sub-iectum''...lies at the foundation of its own fixed qualities and changing circumstances. The superiority of a ''sub-iectum''...arises out of the claim of man to a...self-supported, unshakeable foundation of truth, in the sense of certainty.

This anthropocentric perspective of Descartes' work, establishing human reason as autonomous, provided the basis for the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s emancipation from God and the Church.

Descartes work has been used, in fact to inaugurates an entirely new kind of philosophy.

===Contemporary reception===
In commercial terms, The ''Discourse'' appeared during Descartes' lifetime in a single edition of 500 copies, 200 of which were set aside for the author. Sharing a similar fate was the only French edition of The ''Meditations'', which had not managed to sell out by the time of Descartes' death. A concomitant Latin edition of the latter was, however, eagerly sought out by Europe's scholarly community and proved a commercial success for Descartes.<ref>Maclean, I., introduction to Descartes, R., ''A Discourse on the Method of Correctly Conducting One's Reason and Seeking Truth in the Sciences'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=f9B3zzrPOY4C&pg=PR43 pp. xliii–xliv] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816214235/https://books.google.com/books?id=f9B3zzrPOY4C&pg=PR43 |date=16 August 2021 }}.</ref>{{rp|xliii–xliv}}

Although Descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life, the teaching of his works in schools was controversial. Henri de Roy ([[Henricus Regius]], 1598–1679), Professor of Medicine at the University of Utrecht, was condemned by the Rector of the university, [[Gisbertus Voetius|Gijsbert Voet]] (Voetius), for teaching Descartes' physics.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cottingham |first1=John |author-link=John Cottingham |first2=Dugald |last2=Murdoch |first3=Robert |last3=Stoothof |title=The Philosophical Writings of Descartes |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5cSfRS4m5QC&pg=PA293 |chapter=Comments on a Certain Broadsheet |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1984 |page=293 |isbn=978-0-521-28807-1 |access-date=24 May 2020 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801015720/https://books.google.com/books?id=T5cSfRS4m5QC&pg=PA293 |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to philosophy professor [[John Cottingham]], Descartes's ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' is considered to be "one of the key texts of Western philosophy". Cottingham said that the ''Meditations'' is the "most widely studied of all Descartes' writings".{{sfn|Cottingham|Williams|1996}}{{rp|50}}

According to [[Anthony Gottlieb]], a former senior editor of ''[[The Economist]]'', and the author of ''[[The Dream of Reason]]'' and ''[[The Dream of Enlightenment]]'', one of the reasons Descartes and [[Thomas Hobbes]] continue to be debated in the second decade of the twenty-first century, is that they still have something to say to us that remains relevant on questions such as, "What does the advance of science entail for our understanding of ourselves and our ideas of God?" and "How is government to deal with religious diversity."{{sfn|Gottlieb|2016|page=23}}

In her 2018 interview with Tyler Cowen, [[Agnes Callard]] described Descartes' thought experiment in the ''Meditations'', where he encouraged a complete, systematic doubting of everything that you believe, to "see what you come to". She said, "What Descartes comes to is a kind of real truth that he can build upon inside of his own mind."{{sfn|Cowen|Callard|2018}} She said that [[Hamlet]]'s monologues{{emdash}}"meditations on the nature of life and emotion"{{emdash}}were similar to Descartes' thought experiment. Hamlet/Descartes were "apart from the world", as if they were "trapped" in their own heads.{{sfn|Cowen|Callard|2018}} Cowen asked Callard if Descartes actually found any truths through his thought experiment or was it just "an earlier version of the contemporary argument that we're living in a simulation, where the evil demon is the simulation rather than [[Bayesian reasoning]]?" Callard agreed that this argument can be traced to Descartes, who had said that he had refuted it. She clarified that in Descartes' reasoning, you do "end up back in the mind of God"{{emdash}}in a "universe God has created" that is the "real world"...The whole question is about being connected to reality as opposed to being a figment. If you're living in the world God created, God can create real things. So you're living in a real world."{{sfn|Cowen|Callard|2018}}

===Purported Rosicrucianism===
The membership of Descartes to the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]] is debated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rosicrucian.org/history|title=The Rosicrucian history|website=www.rosicrucian.org|access-date=13 May 2021|archive-date=22 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122044350/https://www.rosicrucian.org/history|url-status=live}}</ref>

Descartes dedicated the work titled ''The Mathematical Treasure Trove of Polybius, Citizen of the World'' to "learned men throughout the world
and especially to the distinguished B.R.C. (Brothers of the Rosy Cross) in Germany".
