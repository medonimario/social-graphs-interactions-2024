'''Edith Stein''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Discalced Carmelites|OCD]]}} (in religion '''Teresa Benedicta of the Cross'''; 12 October 1891 – 9 August 1942) was a [[German Jewish]] philosopher who converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and became a [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] [[nun]]. Edith Stein was murdered in the gas chamber at Birkenau on 9 August 1942, and is canonized as a [[martyr]] and [[saint]] of the [[Catholic Church]]; she is also one of six [[Symbols of Europe#Patron saints|patron saints of Europe]].

Stein was born into an observant [[Jews|Jewish]] family, but had become an [[agnostic]] by her teenage years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Teresa Benedict of the Cross Edith Stein (1891-1942) - biography |url=https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_19981011_edith_stein_en.html |access-date=2024-03-14 |website=www.vatican.va}}</ref> Moved by the tragedies of [[World War I]], in 1915, she took lessons to become a nursing assistant and worked in an infectious diseases hospital. After completing her doctoral thesis at the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1916, she obtained an assistantship there to [[Edmund Husserl]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stein |first=Edith |url=http://archive.org/details/onproblemofempat0000stei |title=On the problem of empathy |date=1964 |publisher=The Hague, M. Nijhoff |others=Internet Archive}}</ref>

From reading the life of the reformer of the [[Carmelites]], [[Teresa of Ávila]],<ref>Teresa de Ávila, ''Libro de la vida''</ref> Stein was drawn to the Christian faith. She was [[baptized]] on 1 January 1922 into the Catholic Church. At that point, she wanted to become a Discalced Carmelite nun but was dissuaded by her spiritual mentor, the archabbot of [[Beuron Archabbey|Beuron]], Raphael Walzer OSB. She then taught at a Jewish [[school of education]] in [[Speyer]]. As a result of the requirement of an "[[Aryan certificate]]" for [[civil servant]]s promulgated by the Nazi government in April 1933 as part of its [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], she had to quit her teaching position.
Edith Stein was admitted as a student to the study of religion to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in [[Cologne]] on 25 November, on the first [[vespers]] of the feast of Saint Teresa of Ávila, and received the [[religious habit]] as a [[novice]] in April 1934, taking the [[religious name]] ''Teresia Benedicta a Cruce'' (Teresia in remembrance of Teresa of Ávila, Benedicta in honour of [[Benedict of Nursia]]). She made her temporary vows on 21 April 1935, and her perpetual vows on 21 April 1938.

The same year, Teresa Benedicta a Cruce and her biological sister Rosa, by then also a convert and an extern ([[Third Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel|tertiary of the order]], who would handle the community's needs outside the monastery), were sent to the [[Carmelite Monastery, Echt|Carmelite monastery]] in [[Echt, Limburg|Echt]], [[Netherlands]], for their safety. In response to the pastoral letter from the Dutch bishops on 26 July 1942, in which they made the treatment of the Jews by the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|Nazis]] a central theme, all baptized Catholics of Jewish origin (according to police reports, 244 people) were arrested by the [[Gestapo]] on the following Sunday, 2 August 1942. They were sent to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], and were murdered in the Birkenau [[Gas chamber|gas chambers]] on 9 August 1942.

==Early life==
[[File:Bad Bergzabern-St Martin-36-Edith Stein-2019-gje.jpg|thumb|right|Icon in [[Bad Bergzabern]]. The scroll shows a quote from her works: "The innermost essence of love is self-offering. The entryway to all things is the Cross"]]
Edith Steins was born in [[Breslau]] (now [[Wrocław]], Poland), [[Lower Silesia]], into an observant [[Jewish]] family. She was the youngest of 11 children and was born on [[Yom Kippur]], that important Jewish festival of the [[Hebrew calendar]]; these facts combined to make her a favorite of her mother.<ref name=VNS>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_19981011_edith_stein_en.html |title=Teresa Benedict of the Cross Edith Stein |work=Vatican News Service}}</ref> She was a very gifted child who enjoyed learning, in a home where her mother encouraged critical thinking, and she greatly admired her mother's wavering religious faith. By her teenage years, however, Stein had become an agnostic.

Though her father died while she was young, her widowed mother was determined to give her children a thorough education and consequently sent Edith to study at the [[Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]] in Breslau. At age 19, Stein moved with her family to Breslau to a house bought by her mother, which she later described in her ''Autobiography''. Today, Edith Stein House hosts a museum dedicated to the history of the Stein family.

==Academic career==
In April 1913, Stein arrived at the [[University of Göttingen]] in order to study for the summer semester with [[Edmund Husserl]]. By the end of the summer, she had decided to pursue her [[doctoral degree]] in philosophy under Husserl and chose [[empathy]] as her thesis topic. Her studies were interrupted in July 1914 because of the outbreak of [[World War I]]. She then served as a volunteer wartime [[Red Cross]] nurse in an uninfectious diseases hospital at [[Hranice (Přerov District)|Mährisch Weißkirchen]] from 7 April to 1 September 1915.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://vahranice.g6.cz/stein.html | title=Vojenská akademie Hranice }}</ref> In 1916, Stein moved to the [[University of Freiburg]] in order to complete her dissertation on [[Empathy]].<ref>Elisa Magrì, Dermot Moran (eds.), ''Empathy, Sociality, and Personhood: Essays on Edith Stein's Phenomenological Investigations'', Springer, 2018, p. 12.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Stein |first=Edith |title=On the Problem of Empathy|year=1989 |isbn=9780935216110 |edition=Third revised |publisher=ICS Publications |location=Washington, D.C. |series=The Collected Works of Edith Stein, vol. 3|oclc=19324020}}</ref> Shortly before receiving her degree from Freiburg she agreed to become Husserl's assistant there.

While Stein had earlier contacts with Catholicism, it was her reading of the autobiography of the mystic [[Teresa of Ávila]] during summer holidays in [[Bad Bergzabern]] in 1921 that prompted her conversion and eventually the desire to seek the life of a [[Discalced Carmelite]]. Baptized on 1 January 1922, and dissuaded by her spiritual advisers from immediately seeking entry to the enclosed and hidden life of a Carmelite nun, Stein obtained a position to teach at the Dominican nuns' school in [[Speyer]] from 1923 to 1931. While there, Stein translated [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''De Veritate'' (''Of Truth'') into [[German language|German]], familiarized herself with Catholic philosophy in general and tried to bridge the phenomenology of her former teacher, Husserl, to [[Thomism]]. She visited Husserl and Heidegger at Freiburg in April 1929, the same month that Heidegger gave a speech to Husserl on his 70th birthday. In 1932 she became a lecturer at the Catholic Church-affiliated Institute for Scientific [[Pedagogy]] in [[Münster]], but [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] legislation passed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi government]] forced her to resign the post in 1933. In a letter to [[Pope Pius XI]], she denounced the Nazi regime and asked the Pope to openly denounce the regime "to put a stop to this abuse of Christ's name."

{{blockquote|As a child of the Jewish people who, by the grace of God, for the past eleven years has also been a child of the Catholic Church, I dare to speak to the Father of Christianity about that which oppresses millions of Germans. For weeks we have seen deeds perpetrated in Germany which mock any sense of justice and humanity, not to mention love of neighbor. For years the leaders of National Socialism have been preaching hatred of the Jews ... But the responsibility must fall, after all, on those who brought them to this point and it also falls on those who keep silent in the face of such happenings.

Everything that happened and continues to happen on a daily basis originates with a government that calls itself 'Christian'. For weeks not only Jews but also thousands of faithful Catholics in Germany, and, I believe, all over the world, have been waiting and hoping for the Church of Christ to raise its voice to put a stop to this abuse of Christ's name. Is not this idolization of race and governmental power which is being pounded into the public consciousness by the radio open heresy? Isn't the effort to destroy Jewish blood an abuse of the holiest humanity of our Savior, of the most blessed Virgin and the apostles? Is not all this diametrically opposed to the conduct of our Lord and Savior, who, even on the cross, still prayed for his persecutors? And isn't this a black mark on the record of this Holy Year which was intended to be a year of peace and reconciliation? We all, who are faithful children of the Church and who see the conditions in Germany with open eyes, fear the worst for the prestige of the Church, if the silence continues any longer.}}

Her letter received no answer, and it is not known for certain whether the Pope ever saw it.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/this-europe-letters-reveal-auschwitz-victims-plea-to-pope-pius-xi-598301.html |title=This Europe: Letters reveal Auschwitz victim's plea to Pope Pius XI |newspaper=The Independent |access-date=21 February 2003 |location=London |first=Peter |last=Popham |date=21 February 2003}}</ref> However, in 1937 the Pope issued an encyclical written in German, ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' (according to its German first words, lit. "With deep anxiety"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_14031937_mit-brennender-sorge.html|title = Mit Brennender Sorge (March 14, 1937) &#124; PIUS XI}}</ref>), in which he criticized Nazism, listed violations of the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] between Germany and the Church of 1933, and condemned antisemitism.

==Discalced Carmelite nun and martyr==
Stein entered the [[Discalced Carmelite]] monastery St. Maria vom Frieden (Our Lady of Peace) in [[Lindenthal, Cologne|Cologne-Lindenthal]] in October 1933 and took the [[religious name]] ''Teresia Benedicta a Cruce'' (Teresa Benedicta of the Cross). In Cologne she wrote her [[metaphysical]] book ''Endliches und ewiges Sein'' (''Finite and Eternal Being''), which attempted to combine the philosophies of [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]] and Husserl.

To avoid the growing [[Nazism|Nazi]] threat, the order transferred Edith and her sister, Rosa, who was also a convert and an extern sister of the Carmel, to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in [[Echt, Limburg|Echt]], [[Netherlands]]. There she wrote ''Studie über Joannes a Cruce: Kreuzeswissenschaft'' ("Studies on [[John of the Cross]]: The Science of the Cross"). In her testament of 9 June 1939<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-this-day-jewish-convert-beatified-1.5246811|title = This Day in Jewish History / Pope announces beatification of Jewish convert|newspaper = Haaretz}}</ref> she wrote: {{blockquote|I beg the Lord to take my life and my death … for all concerns of the sacred hearts of Jesus and Mary and the holy church, especially for the preservation of our holy order, in particular the Carmelite monasteries of Cologne and Echt, as atonement for the unbelief of the Jewish People, and that the Lord will be received by his own people and his kingdom shall come in glory, for the salvation of Germany and the peace of the world, at last for my loved ones, living or dead, and for all God gave to me: that none of them shall go astray.}}

Stein's move to Echt prompted her to be more devout and even more observant of the Carmelite rule. After having her teaching position revoked by the implementation of the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], Stein quickly eased back into the role of instructor at the convent in Echt, teaching both fellow sisters and students within the community Latin and philosophy.<ref name="Mosley, J. 2006 pp. 43-52">Mosley, J. (2006). The Ultimate Sacrifice. In Edith Stein: Modern Saint and Martyr (pp. 43–52). Mahwah, N.J.: HiddenSpring.</ref>

Even prior to the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Stein believed she would not survive the war, going so far as to write to the [[prior (ecclesiastical)|prioress]] to request her permission to "allow [Stein] to offer [her]self to the heart of Jesus as a sacrifice of atonement for true peace" and made a will. Her fellow sisters would later recount how Stein began "quietly training herself for life in a concentration camp, by enduring cold and hunger" after the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940.<ref name="Mosley, J. 2006 pp. 43-52"/>

Ultimately, she would not be safe in the [[Netherlands]]. The [[Catholic Church and Nazi Germany|Dutch Bishops' Conference]] had a public statement read in all churches across the nation on 20 July 1942 condemning Nazi [[racism]]. In a retaliatory response on 26 July 1942 the [[Reichskommissar]] of the Netherlands, [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], ordered the arrest of all Jewish converts who had previously been spared. Along with two hundred and forty-three baptized Jews living in the Netherlands Teresa Benedicta a Cruce was arrested by the [[SS]] on 2 August 1942. She and her sister Rosa were imprisoned at the concentration camps of [[Amersfoort concentration camp|Amersfoort]] and [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]] before being deported to Auschwitz. A Dutch official at Westerbork was so impressed by her sense of faith and calm<ref>{{cite web |title=Edith Stein Convert, Nun, Martyr |last1=Garcia |first1=Laura |date=6 June 1997 |publisher=Catholic Education Resource Center |access-date=3 December 2014 |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/edith-stein-convert-nun-martyr.html |archive-date=12 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312145518/http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/edith-stein-convert-nun-martyr.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> he offered her an escape plan. Stein vehemently refused his assistance, stating: "If somebody intervened at this point and took away [her] chance to share in the fate of [her] brothers and sisters, that would be utter annihilation."<ref name="Mosley, J. 2006 pp. 43-52"/>

On 7 August 1942, early in the morning, 987 Jews were deported to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. It was probably on 9 August that Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, her sister Rosa, and many more Jewish people were killed in a [[gas chamber]] at Birkenau.<ref name=VNS /><ref>{{cite book |first=María Ruiz |last=Scaperlanda |title=Edith Stein: St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross |place=Huntington, Indiana |publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Press |year=2001 |page=154}}</ref>

==Philosophy==

Stein's development as a philosopher is frequently divided into three periods: an early, phenomenological (1916–25), a middle, comparative (1925–33) and a late, Christian (1935–42). In reality the same factors work themselves out throughout her work and propels it forward: 1. a profound understanding of and commitment to the phenomenological method as taught by Husserl and Reinach; 2. a deep sense of responsibility to the other for what we believe and 3. an acceptance of my own inability to form a complete, meaningful worldview without divine assistance. The three periods are best understood as stages of integration of these three factors, with Stein's baptism New Year's Day 1922, marking a decisive step on the way and her entering Carmel 14 October 1933 marking another.

=== The early phenomenological period (1916–25) ===
Stein's dissertation on empathy was according to her own account an attempt to fill a gap in Husserl's work. In her autobiographical ''Life in a Jewish Family'', she recalled that he took empathy to be the crucial act in which intersubjectivity was established, but nowhere detailed exactly what was meant by it. She therefore wanted to undertake this task and thereby clarify this crucial idea for the development of the phenomenological movement. While working as Husserl's assistant (1916–18) she edited Husserl's manuscripts of what was later to be published as ''Ideas II'' and ''III'', and in the process came to understand the extraordinary importance this act has for our constitution of the intersubjective world, and in particular for the objects studied by psychology and the humanities. When she resigned from her position as Husserl's assistant, the first work she undertook was on the phenomenological constitution of those objects: the psyche and the spirit. The result was the two treatises of ''Philosophy of Psychology and the Humanities'', published in Husserl's ''Jahrbuch'' 1922: ''Psychic Causality'' and ''Individual and Community''. From this period also dates ''Introduction to Philosophy,'' ''An Investigation Concerning the State,'' and very importantly ''Freedom and Grace''.

=== The middle comparative period (1925–33) ===
Encouraged to study and compare Thomas Aquinas' philosophy with that of the phenomenological movement, Stein embarked on a translation project of Aquinas' ''De Veritate'', which was to be published in two volumes in 1932. The work, which translates Aquinas' way of thinking into a modern German idiom and restyles it as a contemporary academic treatise, occasioned that Stein engaged with Aquinas' thought as a phenomenologist, i.e. as someone interested in the matters discussed by Aquinas, as distinct from providing an interpretation of Aquinas' thought or writing in prolongation of it as a thomist. The most important works from this period are 'Husserl and Aquinas: A Comparison', in which she discusses the differing methodologies of Husserl and Aquinas and accounts for their differences, ''Potency and Act'', in which she attempts a phenomenological investigation of 'potency' and 'act' and the twin work of anthropology: The ''Structure of the Human Person''. ''Philosophical Anthropology'' and ''What is the Human Being?'' ''Theological Anthropology'' (the second volume remains a highly developed draft rather than a completed work, since Stein's lectures were canceled in 1933). During this period she also lectures on women's education and vocation and on education in general to very large audiences and to great acclaim. In these lectures, published in ESGA 13 and ESGA 16, she works out for herself the important questions concerning social type and essence, which find a fuller development in ''The Structure of the Human Person''.

=== The later Christian period (1934–42) ===
Her first literal assignment in Carmel was to prepare ''Potency and Act'' for publication, a task she accomplished by writing a new book: ''Finite and Eternal Being – An Ascent to the Meaning of Being''. This work proposed a phenomenological doctrine of being ''(Seinslehre)'', which knows itself to be Christian, i.e. as taking Christian Revelation to contribute towards the view of the world in which it looks for and finds the meaning of being in being's unfolding. Stein also worked on [[Dionysius the Areopagite]], translating his works into German and writing (for him) a work supposed to be lost on symbolic theology. Stein's final work, the ''Science of the Cross'', was a commentary on [[John of the Cross]], which developed the specifically Carmelite understanding of the depths of the soul, already of interest to Stein in her early work.

Teresa Benedicta of the Cross was beatified as a martyr on 1 May 1987 in [[Cologne]], Germany, by [[Pope John Paul II]] and then canonized by him 11 years later on 11 October 1998 in [[Rome]]. The miracle that was the basis for her canonization is the cure of Benedicta McCarthy, a little girl who had swallowed a large amount of [[paracetamol]] ([[acetaminophen]]), which causes [[Hepatic vein|hepatic]] [[necrosis]]. The young girl's father, [[Emmanuel Charles McCarthy]], a priest of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]], immediately called together relatives and prayed for Teresa's intercession.<ref name="Toronto">{{cite news |title=Jewish-born nun gassed by Nazis is declared saint; Prayer to Edith Stein sparked tot's 'miraculous' recovery |date=24 May 1997 |work=Toronto Star |pages=A22 }}</ref> Shortly thereafter, the nurses in the intensive care unit saw her sit up, completely healthy.

Teresa Benedicta of the Cross is one of the six [[patron saint]]s of [[Europe]], together with [[Benedict of Nursia]], [[Cyril and Methodius]], [[Bridget of Sweden]], and [[Catherine of Siena]].

Today there are many schools named in tribute to her, for example in her hometown, [[Lubliniec]], Poland <ref>{{Cite web|title=Edith Stein School|url=https://szkolaedyty.pl/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210425101243/https://szkolaedyty.pl/ |archive-date=25 April 2021 }}</ref> [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ess-darmstadt.de |publisher=Ess-darmstadt.de |date=4 December 2012 |access-date=26 December 2012|title=Edith-Stein-Schule Darmstadt }}</ref> [[Hengelo]], [[Netherlands]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edithsteincollege.nl/|title=Edith Stein College – VWO|publisher=Edith Stein College}}</ref> and [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dpcdsb.org/STEIN |title=St. Edith Stein Elementary School |publisher=Dpcdsb.org |access-date=26 December 2012}}</ref> Also named for her are a women's dormitory at the [[University of Tübingen]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edith-stein-heim.de/ |title=Edith-Stein-Studentinnen-Wohnheim |publisher=Edith-stein-heim.de |access-date=26 December 2012 |archive-date=13 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113143154/http://www.edith-stein-heim.de/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> and a classroom building at [[The College of the Holy Cross]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].

[[Lubliniec]] in Poland hosts the Edith Stein Museum (Muzeum Pro Memoria Edith Stein) localised on the first floor of the Courant family house (Edith Stein's grandparents' family home).  [[Wrocław]] hosts a museum called Edith Stein House localised in the house Edith's mother bought for the family in 1919 on the street then called Michaelisstrasse 38 (today [[Nowowiejski|Nowowiejska]] 38).

In Vienna, the Edith-Stein-Haus at Ebendorferstraße 8 is the main location of the Catholic University Chaplaincy and the university pastoral care of the Archdiocese of Vienna. In the spirit of Karl Strobl's model of the "Catholic Student House", the house is also home to a chapel consecrated to Edith Stein as well as a dormitory for about 90 students.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.khg.wien/unit/khg/ueberuns/standorte/editsteinhaus |access-date=2022-09-24 |title=Edith Stein Haus  |language=en}}</ref>

The philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] published a book in 2006 titled ''Edith Stein: A Philosophical Prologue, 1913–1922'', in which he contrasted her living of her own personal philosophy with [[Martin Heidegger]], whose actions during the Nazi era, according to MacIntyre, suggested a "bifurcation of personality."<ref name="macstein">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xpe4WJX8kV8C&q=Edith+Stein+Alasdair+MacIntyre |first1=Alasdair C. |last1=MacIntyre |title=Edith Stein: A Philosophical Prologue, 1913–1922 |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |location=Lanham, Md |year=2006 |page=5 |isbn=9780742559530}}</ref>

Playwright Arthur Giron wrote ''Edith Stein'', a play that was inspired by Stein's life. It was produced at the [[Pittsburgh Public Theater]] in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.samuelfrench.com/p/508/edith-stein|title=Edith Stein &#124; Samuel French|website=samuelfrench.com}}</ref>

In 1988, Edith Stein was pictured on a German postage stamp with [[Rupert Mayer]] SJ in honor of their beatification.

In 1991, the Italian musician [[Juri Camisasca]] released a song inspired by the life of Edith Stein, ''Il carmelo di Echt'' (The carmelite convent of Echt) on the album of the same name. The song was later recorded by [[Giuni Russo]] and [[Franco Battiato]].

In 1995, Hungarian film director [[Márta Mészáros]] made a movie about the life and death of Edith Stein with the title ''[[The Seventh Chamber|A hetedik szoba]]'' (The Seventh Room/Chamber), starring [[Maia Morgenstern]].

In 1999, a memorial statue by German sculptor Bert Gerresheim was dedicated in Cologne, Germany. The statue comprises three different views of Stein reflecting her Jewish and Christian faith, and a pile of empty shoes representing the victims of the holocaust.

In 2007, Stein's life and work was dramatised in the novel ''Winter Under Water'' (Picador, London) by author James Hopkin.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tague|first=John|date=28 January 2007|title=Winter Under Water, by James Hopkin|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/winter-under-water-by-james-hopkin-434041.html|access-date=15 August 2020|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref>

In 2008, the first ''[[Stolperstein]]'' ({{langx|pl|kamienie pamięci}}) that was ever laid in Poland was placed near Edith Stein's childhood home at 38 ul. Nowowiejska (formerly the Michaelisstraße) in Wrocław. Other ''Stolpersteine'' for her are in Cologne (several) and Freiburg.

In 2009, her [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] was installed at the [[Walhalla Memorial]] near [[Regensburg]], [[Germany]]. In June 2009, the International Association for the Study of the Philosophy of Edith Stein (IASPES) was founded, and held its first international conference at Maynooth University, Ireland, in order to advance the philosophical writings of Stein.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edithsteincircle.com |title=The International Association for the Study of the Philosophy of Edith Stein |work=edithsteincircle.com|publisher=Edith Stein Circle }}</ref>

On 6 June 2014, the 70th anniversary of [[D-Day]], a bell dedicated to her was named by [[Prince Charles]] at [[Bayeux]] Cathedral.

Also in 2014, the book ''Edith Stein and [[Regina Jonas]]: Religious Visionaries in the Time of the Death Camps'', by Emily Leah Silverman, was published.

In 2018, American film director [[Joshua Sinclair]] made a movie about the life and death of Edith Stein with the title ''A Rose in Winter'', starring Zana Marjanovic.

In April 2024, during a private audience Pope Francis received a formal request from the [[superior general]] of the [[Discalced Carmelites]], Miguel Márquez Calle, to declare Stein a [[Doctor of the Church]]. The Discalced Carmelites first launched an international commission to gather the necessary documentation required for the declaration in 2022, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Stein's conversion to Catholicism and the 80th anniversary of her martyrdom.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mares |first1=Courtney|title=Could Edith Stein be declared the next doctor of the Church? |date=6 May 2024 |url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/257587/could-edith-stein-be-declared-the-next-doctor-of-the-church |website=[[Catholic News Agency]] |access-date=19 June 2024}}</ref>

==Controversy as to the cause of her murder==
The [[beatification]] of Teresa Benedicta as a [[martyr#Christianity|martyr]] generated criticism. Critics argued that she was murdered because she was Jewish by birth, rather than for her Christian faith,<ref>Abraham Foxman, Leon Klenicki (October 1998). [http://www.adl.org/opinion/edith_stein.asp "The Canonization of Edith Stein: An Unnecessary Problem"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525130544/http://www.adl.org/opinion/edith_stein.asp |date=25 May 2011 }}, ''[[Anti-Defamation League]]''.</ref> and that, in the words of Daniel Polish, the beatification seemed to "carry the tacit message encouraging conversionary activities" because "official discussion of the beatification seemed to make a point of conjoining Stein's Catholic faith with her death with 'fellow Jews' in Auschwitz."<ref>{{cite book |author-link1=Harry James Cargas |first1=Harry James |last1=Cargas |year=1994 |chapter=The Unnecessary Problem of Edith Stein |title=Studies in the Shoah |volume=IV |publisher=[[University Press of America]]}}</ref><ref>Thomas A.
