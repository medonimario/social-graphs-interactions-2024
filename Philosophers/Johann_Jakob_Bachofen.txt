'''Johann Jakob Bachofen''' (22 December 1815 &ndash; 25 November 1887) was a Swiss [[antiquarian]], [[jurist]], [[philologist]], [[anthropologist]], and professor of [[Roman law]] at the [[University of Basel]] from 1841 to 1844.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gentlemen and Amazons: The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory, 1861–1900|last=Eller|first=Cynthia|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520266766|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdyqUVJyS2EC|pages=37–38}}</ref>

Bachofen is most often connected with his theories surrounding prehistoric [[matriarchy]], or ''Das Mutterrecht'', the title of his seminal 1861 book ''Mother Right: an investigation of the religious and juridical character of matriarchy in the Ancient World.'' Bachofen assembled documentation demonstrating that [[motherhood]] is the source of human society, religion, morality, and decorum. He postulated an archaic "mother-right" within the context of a primeval [[Matriarchal religion]] or ''[[Urreligion]]''.

Bachofen became an important precursor of 20th-century theories of matriarchy, such as the [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old European culture]] postulated by [[Marija Gimbutas]] from the 1950s, and the field of [[feminist theology]] and "[[Matriarchal Studies|matriarchal studies]]" in [[second-wave feminism|1970s feminism]].

== ''Das Mutterrecht'' ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2022}}
Bachofen's 1861 ''Das Mutterrecht'' proposed four phases of cultural evolution which absorbed each other:
# Hetaerism: a wild nomadic 'tellurian' [= [[chthonic]] or earth-centered] phase, characterised by him as communistic and [[polyamorous]], whose dominant deity he believed to have been an earthy proto [[Aphrodite]].
# Das Mutterecht: a matriarchal 'lunar' phase based on agriculture, characterised by him by the emergence of [[chthonic]] [[mystery cult]]s and law. Its dominant deity was an early [[Demeter]].
# The Dionysian: a transitional phase when earlier traditions were masculinised as patriarchy began to emerge. Its dominant deity was the original [[Dionysos]].
# The Apollonian: the patriarchal 'solar' phase, in which all trace of the Matriarchal and Dionysian past was eradicated and modern civilisation emerged.

=== Reception ===
{{main|Matriarchy}}
There was little initial reaction to Bachofen's theory of cultural evolution, largely because of his impenetrable literary style, but eventually, along with furious criticism, the book inspired several generations of ethnologists, social philosophers, and even writers: [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]; [[Friedrich Engels]], who drew on Bachofen for ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]''; [[Thomas Mann]]; [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], who was inspired by Bachofen to devote her career to [[mythology]]; [[Walter Benjamin]]; [[Carl Jung]]; [[Erich Fromm]]; [[Robert Graves]]; [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]; [[Joseph Campbell]]; [[Otto Gross]]; [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]] and opponents such as [[Julius Evola]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}  In the 1930s his work was acclaimed by several prominent academics in the German speaking world.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Eller |first=Cynthia |date=2013 |title=Matriarchy and the Volk |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23357881 |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=188–221 |doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfs105 |jstor=23357881 |issn=0002-7189}}</ref>

Because of his theoretical commitment to [[Marxist historiography]], Friedrich Engels [[Marxism and religion|faulted]] Bachofen for regarding "religion as the main lever of the world's history" and therefore considered it a "troublesome and not always profitable task to work your way through [his] big volume [i.e. ''Das Mutterrecht'']". Nevertheless, he credited Bachofen with inaugurating research into the [[history of the family]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Engels |first=Friedrich |date=1902 |title=The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State |translator=[[Ernest Untermann]] |chapter=Author's Preface to the Fourth Edition, 1891 |url=https://archive.org/details/originoffamilypr00enge/ |chapter-url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/preface2.htm |location=Chicago |publisher=[[Charles H. Kerr & Company]]| pages=14, 16}}</ref> He summarized Bachofen's views as follows:<ref>{{cite book|title=[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]|year=2010|first=Friedrich|last=Engels|publisher=Penguin UK|page=49}}</ref>
:"(1) That [[Primitive promiscuity|originally man lived in a state of sexual promiscuity]], to describe which Bachofen uses the mistaken term "[[hetaerism]]";
:(2) that such promiscuity excludes any certainty of paternity, and that descent could therefore be reckoned only in the female line, according to mother-right, and that this was originally the case amongst all the peoples of antiquity;
:(3) that since women, as mothers, were the only parents of the younger generation that were known with certainty, they held a position of such high respect and honor that it became the foundation, in Bachofen's conception, of a regular rule of women (gynaecocracy);
:(4) that the transition to monogamy, where the woman belonged to one man exclusively, involved a violation of a primitive religious law (that is, actually a violation of the traditional right of the other men to this woman), and that in order to expiate this violation or to purchase indulgence for it the woman had to surrender herself for a limited period."  (Friedrich Engels, 1891: see link below)

[[Émile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]] credited Bachofen with upsetting the "old conception" that the father must be "the essential element of the family". Before Bachofen, Durkheim claims that "no one had dreamed that there could be a family organization of which the paternal authority was not the keystone".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Elementary Forms of Religious Life|first=Emile|last=Durkheim|date=2013|publisher=Neeland Media LLC|isbn=9781420947731|oclc=1028943316}}</ref>

In contrast to Engels and Durkheim, the American sociologist [[Carle Zimmerman]] criticized Bachofen's work for initiating a [[paradigm|research paradigm]] in [[sociology]] that "completely divorced" the study of the family from history, replacing the "constant struggle between [[familism]] and [[individualism]]" with "imagination".  He characterized Bachofen and the other members of this research paradigm, such as [[John Ferguson McLennan|J.F. McLennan]], [[Lewis H. Morgan|L.H. Morgan]], [[Edvard Westermarck|E.A. Westermark]], and others, as "evolutionary cultists" and considered them to have "destroyed history as a fundamental study in social science" during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zimmerman |first=Carle C. |date=1947 |title=Family and Civilization |url=https://archive.org/details/familycivilizati0000zimm/ |location=New York |publisher=[[Harper & Brothers]] |pages=571–573}}</ref>

Bachofen's actual writings are that matriarchy originated as a rebellion against promiscuity, because of the sexual strains it caused them, to institute matriarchy and monogamy.

As has been noted by [[Joseph Campbell]] in ''Occidental Mythology'' and others, Bachofen's theories stand in radical opposition to the Aryan origin theories of religion, culture and society, and both Campbell and writers such as Evola have suggested that Bachofen's theories only adequately explain the development of religion among the pre-Aryan cultures of the Mediterranean and the Levant, and possibly Southern Asia, but that a separate, patriarchal development existed among the Aryan tribes which conquered Europe and parts of Asia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Engels said that Bachofen had proved his theory that Matriarchy was promiscuous, but Bachofen argued the opposite, that Matriarchy introduced monogamy.
