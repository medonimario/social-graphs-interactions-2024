He was influenced by [[G.E. Moore]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Sigmund Freud]], and in turn explained and extended their work.

Wisdom was educated at [[Orwell Park School|Aldeburgh Lodge School]], Suffolk, and [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge|Fitzwilliam House, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a first-class BA degree in Moral Sciences in 1924.<ref>{{Who's Who | title=WISDOM, Prof. Arthur John Terence Dibben | id = U176338 | type = was | volume = 2019 | edition = online}}</ref> He is not to be confused with the philosopher [[John Oulton Wisdom]] (1908–1993), his cousin, who shared his interest in psychoanalysis.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.135724|title=A Hundred Years Of Philosophy|last=Passmore|first=John|publisher=Gerald Duckworth and Co|year=1917|pages=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.135724/page/n438 437]|quote="It strikes one as odd that a philosopher should be called ‘Wisdom'; that two bearers of the name should be contemporary philosophers passes beyond the limits of the reasonable; that they should both be interested in psycho-analysis has produced in many minds the justifiable conviction that the two are one.

==Philosophical work==
Before the posthumous publication of Wittgenstein's ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' in 1953, Wisdom's writing was one of the few published sources of information about Wittgenstein's later philosophy.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Holloway |first=John |date=1954 |editor-last=Wittgenstein |editor-first=Ludwig |editor2-last=Anscombe |editor2-first=G. E.

Of Wisdom's 1936 "Philosophical Perplexity."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wisdom |first=John |date=1936 |title=Philosophical Perplexity |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4544284 |journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society |volume=37 |pages=71–88 |doi=10.1093/aristotelian/37.1.71 |issn=0066-7374 |jstor=4544284 |url-access=registration}}</ref> [[J. O. Urmson|J.O. Urmson]] remarked that as the first article "which throughout embodied the new philosophical outlook, it is‘something of a landmark in the history of philosophy."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Urmson |first=J.

O. Urmson |url-access=registration}}</ref>

According to David Pole "in some directions at least Wisdom carries Wittgenstein's work further than he himself did, and faces its consequences more explicitly."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pole |first=David |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqNWDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA103 |title=The Later Philosophy of Wittgenstein |date=1958 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4725-1015-0 |pages=103 |language=en |chapter=Epilogue: John WIsdom}}</ref>

Wisdom wrote a number of essays addressing the question of the nature of religious beliefs, statements and questions. Appraising this work [[D.Z. Phillips]] writes that "No one among contemporary philosophers has done more than Wisdom to show us that religious beliefs are not experimental hypotheses about the world". Wisdom utilises his famous [[Parable of the Invisible Gardener]] to this end.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=D.Z. |title=Wisdom's Gods |journal=The Philosophical Quarterly |date=1969 |volume=19 |issue=74}}</ref>

Wisdom was for most of his career at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and became Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge University. Near the end of his career he was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Oregon]]. A [[Festschrift]] titled ''Wisdom: Twelve Essays'' (1974), edited by [[Renford Bambrough]], was published near the time of his retirement from the same.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Winch |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Winch |date=1975 |title=Wisdom: Twelve Essays Edited by Renford Bambrough Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1974, x + 300 pp., £4.50 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/philosophy/article/abs/wisdom-twelve-essays-edited-by-renford-bambrough-oxford-basil-blackwell-1974-x-300-pp-450/7F627125F6D036251B82E246C49DD67A |journal=Philosophy |language=en |volume=50 |issue=192 |pages=239–244 |doi=10.1017/S0031819100061118 |s2cid=170402166 |issn=1469-817X |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1950 to 1951.

The first recorded use of the term "[[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]]" occurred in Wisdom's 1931 work, "Interpretation and Analysis in Relation to Bentham's Theory of Definition", which expounded on [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham's]] concept of "[[Paraphrase|paraphrasis]]": "that sort of exposition which may be afforded by transmuting into a proposition, having for its subject some real entity, a proposition which has not for its subject any other than a fictitious entity".<ref name="Beaney">{{cite book |last=Beaney |first=Michael |title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Analytic Philosophy |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-923884-2 |editor-last=Beaney |editor-first=Michael |page=42 |chapter=The Historiography of Analytic Philosophy |chapter-url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/46855463/2Beaney_Historiography_of_Analytic_Philosophy.pdf}}</ref> At first Wisdom referred to "logic-analytic philosophers", then to "analytic philosophers". According to Michael Beaney, "the explicit articulation of the idea of paraphrasis in the work of both Wisdom in Cambridge and [[Gilbert Ryle|Ryle]] in Oxford represents a definite stage in the construction of analytic philosophy as a tradition".<ref name="Beaney"/>

He was cremated and his ashes were buried at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge.
