==Life==
{{unreferenced section | date = November 2024}}
Spiegelberg was born in [[Strasbourg]], in the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] region of northeastern France.  He studied at the universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], and [[University of Munich|Munich]], where he encountered [[Edmund Husserl]] and many others in the vanguard of the European phenomenological movement.  He received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1928 from the University of Munich. 
His doctoral dissertation was written under the direction of the phenomenologist [[Alexander Pfänder]] and was titled ''Gesetz und Sittengesetz'' (''Law and Morality'').

In 1937 Spiegelberg left the continent and studied for a year in England before emigrating to the United States.  In the U. S., he taught first at [[Swarthmore College]] and then at [[Lawrence University]], which later awarded him an honorary doctoral degree.

In 1953-54 and 1955-56 he received grants from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] for the preparation of the first edition of his landmark historical survey, ''The Phenomenological Movement: A Historical Introduction''.

In 1963, he relocated to [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] and remained there until his retirement as [[Emeritus Professor]] in 1971.  He also served as visiting professor at the universities of [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] and [[University of Southern California|Southern California]] and as [[Fulbright program|Fulbright]] Lecturer at the University of Munich.

Spiegelberg conducted five influential workshops in phenomenology, during the summers of 1965, 1966, 1967, 1969, and 1972.  The first workshop was supported by a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] and the second by a grant from the [[Monsanto Company]].

In 1981, Washington University established a series of lectures in phenomenology in his honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artsci.wustl.edu/~philos/history/lectures.htm|title = The Department of Philosophy}}</ref>  Herbert Spiegelberg died of [[leukemia]], at the age of 86, at his home in St. Louis, Missouri.
