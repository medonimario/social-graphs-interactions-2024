==Philosophical work==
One of Sober's main fields of research has been the subject of simplicity or [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] in connection with theory evaluation in science.  Sober also has been interested in altruism, both as the concept is used in evolutionary biology and also as it is used in connection with human psychology.  His book with David Sloan Wilson, ''Unto Others: the Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior'' (1998), addresses both topics.

Sober has been a prominent critic of [[intelligent design]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Intelligent Design and Probability Reasoning|journal = International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|date = 2002-01-01|pages = 65–80|volume = 52|issue = 2|first = Elliott|last = Sober|jstor=40036455|doi=10.1023/a:1019579220694|s2cid = 26802074}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Religion|last = Mann|first = William|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-631-22128-9|location = Malden|pages = 117–147}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = What Is Wrong With Intelligent Design?|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6452178|journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology|pages = 3–8|volume = 82|issue = 1|doi = 10.1086/511656|first = Elliott|last = Sober|pmid=17354991|date=March 2007|citeseerx = 10.1.1.153.1827|s2cid = 44420203}}</ref>  He also has written about evidence and probability,<ref>{{Cite book|title = EPSA Philosophy of Science: Amsterdam 2009 {{!}} Henk W. de Regt {{!}} Springer|url = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789400724037#|publisher = www.springer.com|year = 2012|doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-2404-4|access-date = 2016-01-27|isbn = 978-94-007-2403-7|editor1-last = De Regt|editor1-first = Henk W|editor2-first = Stephan|editor2-last = Hartmann|editor3-first = Samir|editor3-last = Okasha}}</ref> scientific realism and instrumentalism,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Instrumentalism, Parsimony, and the Akaike Framework|journal = Philosophy of Science|date = 2002-09-01|issn = 0031-8248|pages = S112–S123|volume = 69|issue = S3|doi = 10.1086/341839|first = Elliott|last = Sober|s2cid = 17810810}}</ref> laws of nature,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A Priori Causal Models of Natural Selection|journal = Australasian Journal of Philosophy|date = 2011-12-01|issn = 0004-8402|pages = 571–589|volume = 89|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/00048402.2010.535006|first = Elliott|last = Sober|s2cid = 170812531}}</ref> the mind-body problem<ref>{{Cite journal|title = link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%253A1004519608950|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%253A1004519608950|doi = 10.1023/a:1004519608950|volume = 95|journal = Philosophical Studies|pages = 135–174|year = 1999|last1 = Sober|first1 = Elliott|s2cid = 14166821|access-date = 2017-08-28|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180605115037/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1004519608950|archive-date = 2018-06-05|url-status = dead}}</ref> and naturalism.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Religion|last = Kvanvig|first = Jonathan|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-19-960322-0|location = New York|pages = 187–221}}</ref>

===Philosophy of biology===
Sober's ''The Nature of Selection: Evolutionary Theory in Philosophical Focus'' (1984) has been instrumental in establishing the philosophy of biology as a prominent research area in philosophy. According to the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], "''The Nature of Selection''...marks the point at which most philosophers became aware of the philosophy of biology."<ref>{{Cite book | chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/biology-philosophy/ |title = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter = Philosophy of Biology|year = 2020|publisher = Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref> In his review of the book, biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] wrote "Sober has ... given us what is perhaps the most careful and penetrating analysis of the concept of natural selection as it affects the process of evolution".<ref>Mayr, Ernst. ''Paleobiology'', Vol. 12, No. 2 (Spring, 1986), pp. 233–239</ref>

Sober has worked on clarifying and defending the idea of [[group selection]]; see, for example, his book with [[David Sloan Wilson]], ''Unto Others – the Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior'' (1998).  Sober also has worked with the biologist Mike Steel, exploring conceptual questions about the idea of [[common ancestry]]. And Sober has worked with the biologist Steven Orzack, clarifying and critiquing [[Richard Levins]]'s 1966 paper "The Strategy of Model Building in Population Biology;" they also have worked together on the concept of [[adaptationism]], and have devised a methodology for testing the hypothesis that two species exhibit a trait because they have a common ancestor, and not because natural selection caused each to evolve the trait.

===Parsimony===
Sober's first publication on parsimony was his 1975 book, ''Simplicity''. In it, he argued that the simplicity of a hypothesis should be understood in terms of a concept of question-relative informativeness. Sober abandoned this theory in the 1980s when he started to think about the concept of [[cladistic parsimony]] used in evolutionary biology. This led him to think of parsimony in terms of the concept of likelihood, an idea he developed in his 1988 book ''Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference''. In the 1990s he started to think about the role of parsimony in model selection theory—for example, in the [[Akaike information criterion|Akaike Information Criterion]]. He published a series of articles in this area with Malcolm Forster, the first of which was their 1994 paper "How to Tell When Simpler, More Unified, or Less Ad Hoc Theories Will Provide More Accurate Predictions." In 2002 he published a new article "Instrumentalism, Parsimony, and the Akaike Framework," explaining how Akaike’s criterion and framework and the ideas behind them connect to the epistemology of instrumentalism. His most recent publication on parsimony, his 2015 book ''Ockham's Razors: A User's Manual'', describes both the likelihood framework and the model selection frameworks as two viable "parsimony paradigms."
