'''Mīr Dāmād''' ({{langx|fa|ميرداماد}}) (c. 1561 – 1631/1632), known also as '''Mir Mohammad Baqer Esterabadi''', or '''Asterabadi''', was a Twelver Shia [[Iran]]ian [[Philosophy|philosopher]] in the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonizing]] [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic Peripatetic traditions]] of [[Avicenna]]. He was a scholar of the traditional Islamic sciences, and foremost figure (together with his student [[Mulla Sadra]]) of the cultural renaissance of [[Iran]] undertaken under the [[Safavid]] dynasty. He was also the central founder of the [[School of Isfahan]], noted by his students and admirers as the Third Teacher (mu'alim al-thalith) after [[Aristotle]] and [[al-Farabi]].

==Philosophy==
His major contribution to [[Islamic philosophy]] was his novel formulation regarding gradations of time and the emanations of the separate categories of time as descending divine hypostases. He resolved the controversy of the createdness or uncreatedness of the world in time by proposing the notion of ''huduth-e-dahri'' (atemporal origination) as an explanation grounded in Avicennan and Suhrawardian categories, whilst transcending them. In brief, excepting God, he argued all things, including the earth and all heavenly bodies, share in both eternal and temporal origination. He influenced the revival of al-falsafa al-yamani ([[Philosophy of Yemen]]), a philosophy based on revelation and sayings of prophets rather than the [[rationalism]] of the [[Greek philosophy|Greeks]], and he is widely recognized as the founder of the School of Isfahan, which embraced a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] outlook known as ''hikmat-i ilahi'' (divine wisdom).

Mir Damad’s many treatises on Islamic philosophy include ''[[Taqwim al-Iman]]'' (''Calendars of Faith'', a treasure on creation and divine knowledge), the ''[[Kitab Qabasat al-Ilahiyah]]'' (''Book of the Divine Embers of Fiery Kindling''), wherein he lays out his concept of atemporal origination, ''[[Kitab al-Jadhawat]]'' and ''[[Sirat al-Mustaqim]]''. He also wrote poetry under the pseudonym of ''Ishraq'' (Illumination). He also wrote a couple of books on mathematics, but with secondary importance.

Among his many other students besides [[Mulla Sadra]] were Seyyed Ahmad-ibn-Reyn-al-A’bedin Alavi, Mohammad ibn Alireza ibn Agajanii, [[Qutb-al-Din Mohammad Ashkevari]] and [[Mulla Shams Gilani]].

Mir Damad's philosophical prose is often accounted as being among the most dense and obtusely difficult of styles to understand, deliberately employing as well as coining convoluted philosophical terminology and neologisms that require systematic analysis and detailed commentary.
He was called Mir Damad (Groom of the King) because he married [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]]'s daughter and hence his fame was based on that event.

==Architecture==
Mir Damad was also the architect of the Masjide Shah ([[Shah Mosque (Isfahan)|Shah Mosque]]) in Isfahan which employed highly advanced mathematical calculations which required the knowledge of the speed of sound at that time. The geometry of the dome is as such that all sound dissipated from the base will echo in hundreds of carefully calculated and masterly executed interior corners of the dome which will ultimately collide in the center of the dome. The geometrical analysis of the dome is of absolute sophistication and the design of the dome is a magnificent piece of art and furthermore the construction of such dome in the 17th century to a precision where all sound waves must travel and collide in an imaginary point above.

== Family ==
His son was Seyed Ali Naghi Astarabadi and his grandson was Sayyid Mahdi bin Sayyid Ali Naqi. His daughter was the wife of Sayyid Ahmad ibn Zayn al-Abidin Alavi.
