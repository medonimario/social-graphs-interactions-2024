'''Johann Franz Buddeus''' or '''Budde''' (sometimes '''Johannes Franciscus Buddeus'''; 25 June 1667, [[Anklam]] &ndash; 19 November 1729, [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]]) was a [[German people|German]] [[Lutheran]] theologian and philosopher.

==Early life and education==
Buddeus was a descendant of the French scholar [[Guillaume Budé]], also known by the [[Latinized name]] Budaeus; the [[Huguenots]] family fled France after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], and those who emigrated to Pomerania Germanized their name as Budde, the Latin equivalent of which was Buddeus.<ref>George Ripley and Charles Anderson Dana, ''The American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge'', Volume 3 (Appleton, 1873), pp. 393, 404.</ref>

He was born at [[Anklam]], [[Swedish Pomerania]], where his father was pastor. He early received a thorough education in classical and Oriental languages, and had read the [[Bible]] through in the original before he went to the [[University of Wittenberg]] in 1685. He was appointed adjunct professor of philosophy there soon after taking his master's degree in 1687, and in 1689 exchanged this for a similar position at [[University of Jena|Jena]], where he also paid much attention to the study of history.

==Career==
In 1692, he went to [[Coburg]] as professor of Greek and Latin in a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], and the next year to the new [[University of Halle]] as professor of moral philosophy. Here he remained until 1705, when he went to Jena as second professor of theology. His lectures embraced all branches of this science, and frequently touched on philosophy, history, and politics.

He remained at Jena for the rest of his life, several times acting as [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university temporarily and being head of his department and an ecclesiastical councilor from 1715.

He was considered the most universally accomplished German theologian of his time. In philosophy he professed an [[eclecticism]] which rested on a broad historical foundation; but he recognized in [[Descartes]] the originator of a new period, and in attacking the "atheist" [[Spinoza]] followed especially the upholders of the [[natural law|law of nature]], such as [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Puffendorf]], and [[Christian Thomasius|Thomasius]]. His theological position was determined by the tradition of [[Johannes Musäus]] at Jena, partly through his close relations with [[Johann Wilhelm Baier|Baier]]; but on another side he was inclined toward [[Pietism]].

==Works==

His works number over a hundred. Those published during the Halle period include ''Elementa philosophiæ practicæ'' (1697) and ''Elementa philosophiæ eclecticæ'' (1703).

To the second Jena period belong among others the ''Institutiones theologiæ moralis'' (1711; German transl., 1719), a work strictly in accordance with his philosophical ethics; the ''Historia ecclesiastica veteris testamenti'' (1715–18); ''Theses theologicæ de atheismo et superstitione'' (1716), which, directed especially against [[Spinoza]], attracted much attention; ''Institutiones theologiæ dogmaticæ'' (1723), a work once very influential, obviously founded on [[Johann Wilhelm Baier|Baier]]'s Compendium; ''Historische und theologische Einleitung in die vornehmsten Religionsstreitigkeiten'' (1724, 1728), edited by [[Johann Georg Walch|Walch]]; ''Isagoge historico-theologica ad theologiam universam'' (1727), dealing with the problems methods, and history of theology in a way remarkable for that time; and ''Ecclesia apostolica'' (1729), intended as an introduction to the study of the [[New Testament]].
