'''Balthazar (Isaac) Orobio de Castro''' (c.1617 in [[Bragança Municipality|Bragança]], [[Portugal]] &ndash; November 7, 1687 in [[Amsterdam]]), was a Portuguese Jewish [[philosopher]], [[physician]] and religious [[apologist]].<ref>Kaplan, Yosef. ''From Christianity to Judaism. The Story of Isaac Orobio de Castro'' translated from Hebrew by Raphael Loewe, (Oxford 1989)({{ISBN|1-904113-14-1}})</ref>

==Life==
While still a child, he was taken to [[Seville]] by his parents, who were [[Marranos]]. He studied philosophy at [[Alcalá de Henares]] and became teacher of [[metaphysics]] at the [[University of Salamanca]]. Later he devoted himself to the study of [[medicine]], and became a popular practitioner in Seville, and physician in ordinary to the duke of [[Medina-Celi]] and to a family nearly related to the king.

When married and father of a family, De Castro was, at the instigation of a servant whom he had punished for theft, denounced to the [[Inquisition]] as an adherent of [[Judaism]], and thrown into a dark and narrow dungeon, where he remained for three years, subjected to the most frightful [[torture]]s. As he persistently denied the charge, he was finally released, but compelled to leave [[Spain]] and to wear the ''[[sanbenito]]'', or penitential garment, for two years. He thereupon went to [[Toulouse]], where he became professor of medicine at the university, at the same time receiving from [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] the title of councilor; but, weary at last of hypocrisy and dissimulation, he went to [[Amsterdam]] about 1666, and there made a public confession of Judaism, adopting the name "Isaac." In that city De Castro continued the practice of medicine, and soon became a celebrity, being elected to membership in the directory of the Portuguese congregation and of several academies of poetry. He died at [[Amsterdam]].  Esther, his wife, died on July 5, 1712.

==Works==
Orobio de Castro was a very prolific writer. His work entitled ''Certamen Philosophicum Propugnatæ Veritatis Divinæ ac Naturalis Adversus J. Bredenburgi Principia'' was published at Amsterdam, 1684 (reprinted 1703 and 1731). This work, in which De Castro attacks the [[Ethics (Spinoza book)|Ethics]] of [[Spinoza]], with whom he maintained a friendly correspondence{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}, was translated into Spanish under the title ''Certamen Philosophico, Defiende la Verdad Divina y Natural Contra los Principios de Juan Bredenburg,'' by [[G. de la Torre]], (The Hague, 1741). ''Certamen Philosophicum'' was translated into english  in September 2020, by Walter Hilliger.<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=978-1735673707|title=Philosophical Case in Defense of Divine and Natural Truth: Certamen Philosophicum, Propugnatae Veritatis Divinae AC Naturalis|last1=Feldman|first1=Seymour|last2=Hilliger|first2=Walter|date=11 September 2020|publisher=Shehakol Incorporated }}</ref> 

All the other writings of De Castro, like the foregoing translation, are still extant in manuscript. They are: 
* ''Prevenciones Divinas Contra la Vana Ydolatria de las Gentes'' (Libro ii, ''Contra los Falsos Misterios de las Gentes Advertidas a Ysrael en los Escritos Propheticos'');<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historiayverdad.org/portada/prevenciones-divinas-contra-la-vana-idolatria-de-las-gentes|title=Prevenciones Divinas Contra la Vana Idolatría de las Gentes|last=Verdad|first=Historia y|website=Historia y Verdad|language=es|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>
*''Explicação Paraphrastica sobre o Capitulo 53 do Propheta Isahias. Feito por hum Curiozo da Nação Hebrea em Amsterdam, em o mez de Tisry anno 5433'' (compare [[Adolf Neubauer]], ''The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah,'' pp.&nbsp;21–118, London, 1876); 
*''Tratado em que se Explica la Prophesia de las 70 Semanas de Daniel. Em Amsterdam à 6 Febrero anno 1675,'' a [[paraphrase|paraphrastic]] explanation of the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks]]; 
*''Epistola Invectiva Contra un Judio Philosopho Médico, que Negava la Ley de Mosse, y Siendo Atheista Affectava la Ley de Naturaleza.'' This is identical with ''Epistola Invectiva Contra Prado, un Philosopho Medico, que Dubitava, o no Creya la Verdad de la Divina Escritura, y Pretendió Encubrir su Malicia con la Affecta Confacion de Dios, y Ley de Natureza,'' a work directed against [[Juan de Prado]], a physician and author of [[Picardy]] who resided in Amsterdam.

Long after De Castro's death a Jew by the name of [[Henriquez]] published an alleged work of his in French under the title ''Israel Vengé,'' claiming it to have been originally written in Spanish (London, 1770). It has been translated into English by [[Grace Aguilar]] (London, 1839).

De Castro's discussions on [[Christianity]] with the Dutch preacher [[Philipp van Limborch]] were published by the latter in the work entitled ''De Veritate Religionis Christianæ Amica Collatio cum Erudito Judæo,'' Amsterdam, 1687.
