Ibn Masarra was born in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in 883.<ref name=ME>Michael Ebstein, ''Mysticism and Philosophy in al-Andalus: Ibn Masarra, Ibn al-ʿArabī and the Ismāʿīlī Tradition'' (Brill, 2014), pp. 8–9.</ref> He is believed to have been [[Muwallad]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvlthkbFU1UC&q=Ibn+Masarra+&pg=PA878|title=History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century|last=Laet|first=Sigfried J. de|date=1994|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=9789231028137|language=en}}</ref> In his youth, he travelled to [[Kairouan]] and [[Mecca]] before settling in the [[Sierra Morena]] near his home town. This is the origin of his nickname, ''al-Jabali'' ('the mountain-dweller'). After his death in 931, his followers were accused of heresy and forced to publicly recant his teachings by the [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Umayyad]] authorities. In at least one case, his books were burnt.<ref name=ME/>
