'''Sidney Hook''' (December 20, 1902 – July 12, 1989) was an American philosopher of [[pragmatism]] known for his contributions to the [[philosophy of history]], the [[philosophy of education]], [[political theory]], and [[ethics]]. After embracing [[communism]] in his youth, Hook was later known for his criticisms of [[totalitarianism]], both [[fascism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]]. A [[social democrat]], Hook sometimes cooperated with [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], particularly in opposing Marxism–Leninism. After [[World War II]], he argued that members of such groups as the [[Communist Party USA]] and [[Leninists]] like [[democratic centralists]] could ethically be barred from holding the offices of public trust because they called for the violent overthrow of democratic governments.

Sidney Hook was born on December 20, 1902, in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], to Jennie and Isaac Hook, [[Austria]]n [[Judaism|Jewish]] immigrants.  He became a supporter of the [[Socialist Party of America]] during the [[Eugene V. Debs|Debs]] era when he was in high school.{{cn|date=February 2022}}

In 1923, he earned a [[Bachelor's degree|BA]] at the [[City College of New York]] and in 1927 [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at [[Columbia University]], where he studied under [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher [[John Dewey]].{{cn|date=February 2022}}

==Career==

In 1926, Hook became a professor of philosophy at [[New York University]] and was head of the [[New York University Department of Philosophy|Department of Philosophy]] from 1948 to 1969. He retired from the University in 1972.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1931, Hook began teaching at the [[New School for Social Research]] through 1936, after which he taught night school there until the 1960s.<ref>

===Marxist===

At the beginning of his career, Hook was a prominent expert on [[Karl Marx]]'s philosophy and was himself a [[Marxism|Marxist]]. He attended the lectures of [[Karl Korsch]] in Berlin in 1928 and conducted research at the [[Marx-Engels Institute]] in [[Moscow]] in the summer of 1929.<ref>Michael Denning, ''The Cultural Front'', New York City: Verso, 1997, p. 425ff</ref> At first, he wrote enthusiastically about the [[Soviet Union]], and, in 1932, supported the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]'s candidate, [[William Z. Foster]], when he ran for [[President of the United States]]. However, Hook broke completely with the [[Comintern]] in 1933, holding its policies responsible for the triumph of [[Nazism]] in [[Germany]]. He accused [[Joseph Stalin]] of putting "the needs of the Russian state" over the needs of the international revolution.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mises.org/misesreview_detail.asp?control=86&sortorder=issue |title=Letters of Sidney Hook |first1=David |last1=Gordon |date=Fall 1998 |website=Ludwig von Mises Institute |access-date=2016-03-18 |archive-date=2007-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717160939/http://www.mises.org/misesreview_detail.asp?control=86&sortorder=issue |url-status=dead }}</ref>

However, Hook remained active in some of the causes of the Marxist left during the [[Great Depression]]. In 1933, with [[James Burnham]], Hook was one of the organizers of the [[American Workers Party]], led by the Dutch-born [[pacifism|pacifist]] minister [[A.J. Muste]].<ref>John P. Diggins, ''Up From Communism'', New York City: Columbia University Press, 1974, then Harper & Row, 1975, pp. 169-170.</ref> Hook also debated the meaning of Marxism with radical [[Max Eastman]] in a series of public exchanges.<ref>Diggins, ''Up From Communism'', pp. 51-58.</ref> Eastman, like Hook, had studied under John Dewey at Columbia University.  In the late 1930s, Hook assisted [[Leon Trotsky]] in his efforts to clear his name in a special [[Dewey Commission|Commission of Inquiry]] headed by Dewey, which investigated charges made against Trotsky during the [[Moscow Trials]].{{cn|date=February 2022}}

===Anti-communist===

The [[Great Purge]] encouraged Hook's increasing ambivalence toward Marxism. In 1939, Hook formed the Committee for Cultural Freedom, a short-lived organization that set the stage for his postwar politics by opposing "totalitarianism" on the left and right. By the [[Cold War]], Hook had become a prominent [[Anti-Communism|anti-Communist]], although he continued to consider himself both a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] and a [[secular humanist]] throughout his life. He was, therefore, an anti-Communist socialist. In 1973, he was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | access-date=October 18, 2012 | archive-date=October 20, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | url-status=dead }}</ref>

{{Social democracy sidebar|expanded=Precursors}}
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Hook helped found Americans for Intellectual Freedom, the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] (CCF), and the [[American Committee for Cultural Freedom]]. These bodies&mdash;of which the CCF was most central&mdash;were funded in part by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] through a variety of fronts and sought to dissuade American leftists from continuing to advocate cooperation with the [[Soviet Union]] as some had previously.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 'shocked' treatment|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/dec/8/20051208-092510-1714r/|newspaper=Washington Times|date=December 8, 2005}}</ref> Hook later wrote in his memoirs that he, "like almost everyone else," had heard that "the CIA was making some contribution to the financing of the Congress."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Liberal Conspiracy: The Congress for Cultural Freedom and the Struggle for the Mind of Postwar Europe|last=Coleman|first=Peter|publisher=The Free Press|year=1989|location=New York|pages=49}}</ref>

On February 6, 1953, Hook discussed "The Threat to Academic Freedom" with [[Victor Riesel]] and others in the evening on [[WEVD]] radio (a Socialist radio station whose call letters referred to SPA founder [[Eugene V. Debs]]).<ref>

In the 1960s, Hook was a frequent critic of the [[New Left]]. He was opposed to a unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from the [[Vietnam War]] and defended California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]'s removal of [[Angela Davis]] from her professorship at [[UCLA]] because of her leadership role in the [[Communist Party USA]].

Hook was elected a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1965<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=19 April 2011}}</ref> and ended his career in the 1970s and 1980s as a fellow of the [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Hoover Institution]] in [[Stanford, California|Stanford]], [[California]].

===Personal life and death===
Hook was a lifelong agnostic.<ref>{{cite book|title=Letters of Sidney Hook: democracy, communism, and the cold war|year=1995|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=9781563244872|page=2|editor=Edward S. Shapiro|quote=This faith in rationality emerged early in Hook's life. Even before he was a teenager he proclaimed himself to be an agnostic. It was simply irrational, he declared, to believe in the existence of a merciful and powerful God in the face of widespread human misery. Only the pleadings of his parents that he not embarrass them in front of relatives and friends convinced Hook to participate in a Bar Mitzvah ceremony on his thirteenth birthday. People frequently asked him in his later years what he would say if he discovered after death that God really existed. He answered that he would simply state, "God, you never gave me enough evidence."}}</ref>

He married Carrie Katz in 1924, with whom he had one son.  The couple separated in 1933.<ref name=Shapiro>

There, she studied under [[Scott Nearing]] and came to write a chapter in his book ''The Law of Social Revolution'' entitled "The Russian Revolution of 1917" (1926).  Friends from the Rand School included Nerma Berman Oggins, wife of [[Cy Oggins]].  She was a Communist Party member who was a "Fosterite" (i.e., she supported [[William Z. Foster]] amidst Party factionalism in the last 1920s).  She went on to work at the [[Labor Defense Council]].<ref>

==Legacy==
{{Humanism}}
Hook's memoir, ''Out of Step'', recounts his life, his activism for a number of educational causes, his controversies with other intellectuals such as [[Noam Chomsky]], and his recollections of [[Mortimer J. Adler]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Morris Raphael Cohen|Morris Cohen]], [[John Dewey]], [[Max Eastman]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Bertrand Russell]].<ref>Sidney Hook, ''Out of Step'', New York City: Harper & Row, chapters 5, 7, 23, 28, and 29, 1987.</ref>

In October 2002, a conference marking the centennial of Hook's birth was organized by Matthew Cotter and [[Robert B. Talisse|Robert Talisse]] and held at the [[City University of New York]] Graduate Center in [[Manhattan]].

In April 2011 the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI) (formerly known as CSICOP) again honored Hook.  At a meeting of its executive council in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] he was selected for inclusion in their Pantheon of Skeptics.  The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pantheon of Skeptics|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|website=CSI|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|access-date=30 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131054129/http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|archive-date=31 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===''Hero in History''===
Sidney Hook's book ''The Hero in History'' was a noticeable event in the studies devoted to the role of the [[hero]], the [[Great Man theory|Great Man]] in history and the influence of people of significant accomplishments.

Hook opposed all forms of [[determinism]] and argued, as had [[William James]], that humans play a creative role in constructing the social world and to transforming their natural environment. Neither humanity nor its universe is determined or finished. For Hook this conviction was crucial. He argued that when a society is at the crossroads of choosing the direction of further development, an individual can play a dramatic role and even become an independent power on whom the choice of the historical pathway depends.<ref>Hook, S., ''The Hero in History: A Study in Limitation and Possibility''. Boston, Masachuestts: Beacon Press, 1943, p. 116</ref>

In his book, Hook provided a great number of examples of the influence of great people, and the examples are mostly associated with various crucial moments in history, such as revolutions and crises. Some scholars have critically responded because, as one of them claims, "he does not take into account that an individual's greatest influence can be revealed not so much in the period of the old regime's collapse, but in the formation period of a new one. [...] Besides, he did not make clear the situation when alternatives appear either as the result of a crisis or as the result of Great Man's plan or intention without [a] manifested crisis".<ref>[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, Leonid]], ''The Role of an Individual in History: A Reconsideration. Social Evolution and History,'' vol. 9, no. 2, 2010, pp. 95–136, 108.</ref>

Hook introduced a theoretical division of historic personalities and especially leaders into the eventful man and the event-making man, depending on their influences on the historical process.<ref>''Professor Walter Earl Fluker Discusses Leadership, Obama and Civil Rights Pioneers'' {{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2009/February/20090227164810eaifas0.1341669.html |title=Professor Discusses Leadership, Obama and Civil Rights Pioneers |access-date=2011-02-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206212240/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2009/February/20090227164810eaifas0.1341669.html |archive-date=2011-02-06 }}</ref> For example, he considers [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] as having been an event-making man, because of his having acted in an important circumstance to change the developmental direction not only of [[Russia]] but also of the whole world in the 20th century.

Hook attached great importance to accidents and contingencies in history,<ref>Hook, S., ''The Hero in History: A Study in Limitation and Possibility'', Boston, Massachusetts: Beacon Press, 1955, p. 142.</ref> thus opposing, among others, [[H. A. L. Fisher|Herbert Fisher]],<ref>Fisher, H., 1935. ''A History of Europe'', vol. I, London, p. vii (reprint Fontana Press, 1984)</ref> who made attempts to present history as "waves" of emergencies.

==="Ethics of Controversy"===
In 1954, Hook published an essay titled "The Ethics of Controversy" in which he set down ten ground rules for democratic discourse within a democracy.<ref>"The Ethics of Controversy," New Leader, February 1, 1954, republished in ''Sidney Hook on Pragmatism, Democracy and Freedom: The Essential Essays'', (Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 2002), edited by Robert Talilsse and Robert Tempio, pp. 292-93.</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://prosperitynow.org/blog/sid-hooks-ethics-controversy | title=Sid Hook's Ethics of Controversy &#124; Prosperity Now | date=4 September 2007 }}</ref>
