'''Arnold Ruge''' (13 September 1802 – 31 December 1880) was a German [[philosopher]] and [[politics|political]] writer. He was the older brother of Ludwig Ruge.

==Studies in university and prison==
Born in [[Bergen auf Rügen]], he studied in [[University of Halle|Halle]], [[University of Jena|Jena]] and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]].  As an advocate of a free and united Germany, he shared in the student agitations of 1821–24, and was jailed from 1824 to 1830<ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Ruge, Arnold|year=1905}}</ref> in the fortress of [[Kolobrzeg|Kolberg]], where he studied [[Plato]] and the Greek poets.  Moving to [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] on his release, he published a number of plays — including ''Schill und die Seinen'', a tragedy — and translations of [[Greek language|ancient Greek]] texts — e.g. ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''.  He became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the [[University of Halle]] in 1832.<ref name=nie/>

==Hegelians==
He also became associated with the [[Young Hegelians]].  In 1837, with E. T. Echtermeyer, he founded the ''Hallesche Jahrbücher für deutsche Kunst und Wissenschaft''. In this periodical he discussed the questions of the time from the point of view of the Hegelian philosophy.<ref>Warren Breckman, "Arnold Ruge: Radical Democracy and the Politics of Personhood, 1838-1843," ''Marx, the Young Hegelians and the Origins of Radical Social Theory: Dethroning the Self''.  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999</ref>  According to [[Frederick Copleston]]:<ref>''A History of Philosophy'', volume VII, p. 301.</ref>
<blockquote>"Ruge shared Hegel's belief that history is a progressive advance towards the realization of freedom, and that freedom is attained in the State, the creation of the rational General Will.[...] At the same time he criticized Hegel for having given an interpretation of history which was closed to the future, in the sense that it left no room for novelty."</blockquote>
The ''Jahrbücher'' was detested by the orthodox party in [[Prussia]]; and was finally suppressed by the [[Saxony|Saxon]] government in 1843, and Ruge left for Paris.

In Paris, Ruge co-edited the ''[[Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher]]'' with [[Karl Marx]] briefly.<ref>Copleston p.307</ref> He had little sympathy with Marx's socialistic theories, and soon left him. He left Paris in 1845 for [[Switzerland]], and then became a bookseller in [[Leipzig]].<ref name=nie/>

==Revolutions of 1848==
In the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movement of 1848]], he organized the extreme left in the [[Frankfurt parliament]], and for some time he lived in Berlin as the editor of the ''Die Reform''. He supported the Polish demands during the revolution, but based on his belief that failure to meet Polish demands would result in Russia unleashing "the hatred of the entire Slavic element, of this monstrous family of peoples."<ref>Brian E. Vick, ''Defining Germany: the 1848 Frankfurt parliamentarians and national identity'', Harvard University Press, 2002, p. 192.</ref>

The Prussian government intervened and Ruge soon afterwards left again for Paris, hoping, through his friend [[Alexandre Ledru-Rollin]], to establish relations between German and French republicans; but in 1849 both Ledru-Rollin and Ruge had to take refuge in London.

==London and Brighton==

In London, in company with [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and other advanced politicians, he formed a "European Democratic Committee." From this Ruge soon withdrew, and in 1850, Ruge moved to [[Brighton]] to live as a teacher and writer. In 1866, he vigorously supported Prussia against [[Austria]] in the [[Austro-Prussian War]], and in 1870, he supported Germany against France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. On a smaller scale, while in Brighton, he was chairman of the successful ''[[Park Crescent, Brighton|Park Crescent]] Residents' Association''. In his last years, beginning in 1877, he received from the German government a pension of 1000 marks.

He died in Brighton in 1880.

==Works==
In his time, Ruge was a leader in religious and political liberalism. In 1846-48 his
''Gesammelte Schriften'' (Collected writings) were published in ten volumes. After this
time he wrote, among other books, ''Manifest an die deutsche Nation'' (1866), ''Geschichte unserer Zeit'' (1881), ''Unser System'', ''Revolutionsnovellen'',
''Die Loge des Humanismus'', and ''Aus früherer Zeit'' (his
memoirs; 1863–67). He also wrote many poems, and several dramas and
romances, and translated into German various English works,
including the ''Letters of Junius'' and Buckle's ''History of Civilization''.
His ''Letters and Diary'' (1825–80) were published by Paul Nerrlich
(Berlin, 1885–87). See A. W. Bolin's ''L. Feuerbach'', pp.&nbsp;127–52
(Stuttgart, 1891).
