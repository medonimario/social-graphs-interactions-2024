'''Agostino Nifo''' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] as '''Augustinus Niphus'''; {{circa|1473}}{{snd}}1538 or 1545) was an Italian [[philosopher]] and commentator.

==Life==
He was born at [[Sessa Aurunca]] near [[Naples]]. He proceeded to [[Padua]], where he studied philosophy. He lectured at [[Padua]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], and [[Pisa]], and won so high a reputation that he was deputed by [[Leo X]] to defend the [[Catholic]] doctrine of [[immortality]] against the attack of [[Pomponazzi]] and the [[Alexandrists]]. In return for this he was made Count [[Palatinus (Roman Catholic Church)|Palatine]], with the right to call himself by the name [[Medici]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Nifo, Agostino|volume=19|page=673}}</ref>

==Work==
In his early thought he followed [[Averroes]], but afterwards modified his views so far as to make himself acceptable to the orthodox Catholics. In 1495 he produced an edition of the works of Averroes; with a commentary compatible with his acquired orthodoxy.<ref name="EB1911"/>

In the great controversy with the Alexandrists he opposed the theory of [[Pietro Pomponazzi]], that the rational [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is inseparably bound up with the material part of the individual, and hence that the death of the body carries with it the death of the soul. He insisted that the individual soul, as part of absolute intellect, is indestructible, and on the death of the body is merged in the eternal unity.<ref name="EB1911"/>
