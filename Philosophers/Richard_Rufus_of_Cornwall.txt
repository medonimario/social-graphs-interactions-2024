==Life==
Richard Rufus who studied at [[University of Paris|Paris]] and at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] starting from the 1220s. He became a Franciscan around 1230. Rufus was one of the first medieval philosophers to write on [[Aristotle]] and his commentaries are the earliest known among those which have survived. He also wrote influential commentaries on [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''Sentences''. Rufus was influenced by [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Alexander of Hales]], [[Richard Fishacre]], and [[Johannes Philoponus]], and in turn influenced [[Bonaventure]] and [[Franciscus Meyronnes]]. [[Roger Bacon]] was a fervent critic of Rufus, claiming that his fame was greatest with the ignorant multitude; on the other hand, [[Thomas of Eccleston]] praised him as an excellent lecturer. [[Adam de Marisco]] describes him in a letter to Grosseteste as "a man lacking in command of the English tongue, yet of most honest conversation and unblemished reputation, learned in human and divine literature." The reason given for his lack of proficiency with English is that he was primarily a [[Cornish language|Cornish]] speaker.
