'''Athanasius Kircher''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Society of Jesus|SJ]]}} (2 May 1602&nbsp;– 27 November 1680)<ref>Glassie, p. 246</ref> was a German [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] scholar and [[polymath]] who published around 40&nbsp;major works of [[comparative religion]], [[geology]], and [[medicine]]. Kircher has been compared to fellow Jesuit [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]] and to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] for his vast range of interests, and has been honoured with the title "Master of a Hundred Arts".<ref name="Woods108">Woods, p. 108.</ref> He taught for more than 40&nbsp;years at the [[Roman College]], where he set up a [[wunderkammer]]. A resurgence of interest in Kircher has occurred within the scholarly community in recent decades.

Kircher claimed to have deciphered the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] of the ancient [[Egyptian language]], but most of his assumptions and translations in the field turned out to be wrong. He did, however, correctly establish the link between the ancient Egyptian and the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] languages, and some commentators{{Who|date=November 2023}} regard him as the founder of [[Egyptology]]. Kircher was also fascinated with [[Sinology]] and wrote an encyclopedia of [[China]], where he revealed the early presence of [[Nestorian Christians]] while also attempting to establish links with Egypt and Christianity.

Kircher's work in geology included studies of [[volcano]]es and [[fossil]]s. One of the first researchers to observe microbes through a [[microscope]], Kircher was ahead of his time in proposing that the [[Black Death|plague]] was caused by an infectious [[microorganism]] and in suggesting effective measures to prevent its spread. Kircher also displayed a keen interest in technology and mechanical inventions; inventions attributed to him include a magnetic clock, various [[automaton]]s and the first [[megaphone]]. The invention of the [[magic lantern]] has been misattributed to Kircher,<ref name="Britannica">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Athanasius-Kircher |title=Athanasius Kircher |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=June 4, 2016 }}</ref> although he conducted a study of the principles involved in his ''[[Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae]]''.

A scientific star in his day, towards the end of his life he was eclipsed by the [[rationalism]] of [[René Descartes]] and others. In the late 20th&nbsp;century, however, the [[aesthetic]] qualities of his work again began to be appreciated. One modern scholar, Alan Cutler, described Kircher as "a giant among seventeenth-century scholars", and "one of the last thinkers who could rightfully claim all knowledge as his domain".<ref>Cutler, p. 68.</ref> Another scholar, Edward&nbsp;W. Schmidt, referred to Kircher as "the last [[Polymath|Renaissance man]]". In ''[[A Man of Misconceptions]],'' his 2012 book about Kircher, John Glassie wrote "many of Kircher's actual ideas today seem wildly off-base, if not simply bizarre,"<ref>John Glassie: A Man of Misconceptions: The Life of an Eccentric in an Age of Change. New York, Riverhead, 2012, p. xiv.</ref> but he was "a champion of wonder, a man of awe-inspiring erudition and inventiveness," whose work was read "by the smartest minds of the time."<ref>Glassie, p. xv.</ref>

==Life==
Kircher was born on 2 May in either 1601 or 1602 (he himself did not know) in [[Geisa]], [[Buchonia]], near [[Fulda]] ([[Thuringia]], [[Germany]]). From his birthplace, he took the epithets ''Bucho, Buchonius'' and ''Fuldensis'' which he sometimes added to his name. He attended the Jesuit College in Fulda from 1614 to 1618, when he entered the [[novitiate]] of the Society.

The youngest of nine children, Kircher studied volcanoes owing to his passion for rocks and eruptions. He was taught [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] by a [[rabbi]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Wo-w2sl6zEC&q=Athanasius+Kircher+hebrew&pg=PA76|title=A Study of the Life and Works of Athanasius Kircher, 'Germanus Incredibilis': With a Selection of His Unpublished Correspondence and an Annotated Translation of His Autobiography.|last=Fletcher|first=John Edward|date=2011-08-25|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-9004207127|language=en}}</ref> in addition to his studies at school. He studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at [[Paderborn]],<ref name="Britannica"/> but fled to [[Cologne]] in 1622 to escape advancing [[Protestant]] forces. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} On the journey, he narrowly escaped death after falling through the ice crossing the frozen [[Rhine]] — one of several occasions on which his life was endangered. Later, traveling to [[Heilbad Heiligenstadt|Heiligenstadt]], he was caught and nearly [[hanging|hanged]] by a party of Protestant soldiers. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

From 1622 to 1624 Kircher was sent to begin his [[regency (Jesuit)|regency]] period in [[Koblenz]] as a teacher. This was followed by assignment to [[Heilbad Heiligenstadt|Heiligenstadt]], where he taught [[mathematics]], Hebrew and [[Aramaic language|Syriac]], and produced a show of [[firework]]s and moving scenery for the visiting [[Prince-Elector|Elector]] [[Archbishop of Mainz]], showing early evidence of his interest in [[mechanics|mechanical devices]]. He was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Catholic priest|priesthood]] in 1628<ref name="Britannica"/> and became professor of [[ethics]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Würzburg]], where he also taught Hebrew and Syriac. Beginning in 1628, he began to show an interest in Egyptian hieroglyphs.

In 1631, while still at [[Würzburg]], Kircher allegedly had a prophetic vision of bright light and armed men with horses in the city. Würzburg was attacked shortly afterwards and captured, leading to Kircher being accorded respect for predicting the disaster via astrology, though Kircher privately insisted that he had not relied on it.<ref>Newman & Grafton, 1-2</ref> This was the year that Kircher published his first book (the ''[[Ars Magnesia]]'', reporting his research on [[magnetism]]), but having been caught up in the [[Thirty Years' War]] he was driven to the papal [[University of Avignon]] in [[France]]. In 1633 he was called to [[Vienna]] by the [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] to succeed [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] as Mathematician to the [[Habsburg]] court. On the intervention of [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]], the order was rescinded, and he was sent instead to [[Rome]] to continue with his scholarly work, but he had already embarked for Vienna.

On the way, his ship was blown off course and he arrived in Rome before he knew of the changed destination. He based himself in the city for the rest of his life, and from 1634<ref>Fletcher 2011, p. 31.</ref> he taught mathematics, [[physics]] and [[Oriental language]]s at the Collegio Romano (now the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]) for several years before being released to devote himself to research. He studied [[malaria]] and the [[Black Death|plague]], amassing a collection of [[Archaeology|antiquities]], which he exhibited along with devices of his own creation in the [[Kircherian Museum|Museum Kircherianum]].

In 1661, Kircher discovered the ruins of a [[Church (building)|church]] said to have been constructed by [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] on the site of [[Saint Eustace]]'s vision of a crucifix in a stag's horns. He raised money to pay for the church's reconstruction as the ''{{ill|Santuario della Mentorella|it|Santuario della Mentorella}},'' and his heart was buried in the church upon his death. {{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

==Works==
[[File:Latium (cropped).tif|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to Kircher's ''Latium''.]]
Kircher published many substantial books on a wide variety of subjects such as [[Egyptology]], [[geology]], and [[music theory]]. His [[Syncretism|syncretic]] approach disregarded conventional boundaries between disciplines: his ''[[Magnes sive de Arte Magnetica|Magnes]]'', for example, ostensibly discussed [[magnetism]], but also explored other modes of attraction such as [[gravity]] and [[love]]. Perhaps Kircher's best-known work is ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' (1652–54), a vast study of Egyptology and [[comparative religion]].<ref name="Kircher, Athanasius 2008">"Kircher, Athanasius." Encyclopædia Britannica from ''Encyclopædia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite''. (2008).</ref>

His books, written in [[Latin]], were widely circulated in the 17th century, and contributed to the wide dissemination of scientific information. Kircher is not considered to have made any significant original contributions, although some discoveries and inventions (e.g., the [[magic lantern]]) have sometimes been mistakenly attributed to him.<ref name="Kircher, Athanasius 2008"/>

====Egyptology====

[[File:Athanasius Kircher Koptisches Alphabet.jpg|thumb|The [[Coptic language|Coptic]] alphabet, from ''[[Prodromus Coptus]] sive aegyptiacus''.]]
The [[Graffito of Esmet-Akhom|last known example]] of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyphics]] dates from AD 394, after which all knowledge of hieroglyphics was lost.<ref name="Frimmer37">Frimmer, p 37</ref> Until [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Jean-François Champollion]] found the key to hieroglyphics in the 19th century, the main authority was the 4th-century Greek grammarian [[Horapollon]], whose chief contribution was the misconception that hieroglyphics were "picture writing" and that future translators should look for symbolic meaning in the pictures.<ref>Frimmer, pp 37–39</ref>

The first modern study of hieroglyphics came with [[Piero Valeriano Bolzani]]'s ''Hieroglyphica'' (1556).<ref name="Frimmer37"/> Kircher was the most famous of the "decipherers" between ancient and modern times and the most famous Egyptologist of his day.<ref name="Frimmer38">Frimmer, p 38</ref> In his ''[[Lingua Aegyptiaca Restituta]]'' (1643), Kircher called hieroglyphics "this language hitherto unknown in Europe, in which there are as many pictures as letters, as many riddles as sounds, in short as many mazes to be escaped from as mountains to be climbed".<ref name="Frimmer38"/> While some of his notions are long discredited, portions of his work have been valuable to later scholars, and Kircher helped pioneer Egyptology as a field of serious study.
[[File:AthKircherProdromusCoptus.jpg|thumb|Athanasius Kircher, Prodromus Coptus Sive Aegyptiacus, Rome 1636]]
Kircher's interest in Egyptology began in 1628 when he became intrigued by a collection of hieroglyphs in the library at [[Speyer]]. He learned [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in 1633 and published its first grammar in 1636, the ''[[Prodromus Coptus|Prodromus coptus sive aegyptiacus]]''. Kircher then broke with Horapollon's interpretation of hieroglyphs with his ''Lingua aegyptiaca restituta''. Kircher argued that Coptic preserved the last development of [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]].<ref name="Frimmer38"/><ref name="Woods109">Woods, p 109</ref> For this Kircher has been considered the true "founder of Egyptology", because his work was conducted "before the discovery of the [[Rosetta Stone]] rendered Egyptian hieroglyphics comprehensible to scholars".<ref name="Woods109"/> He also recognized the relationship between [[hieratic]] and hieroglyphic scripts.

[[File:Oedipus lost het raadsel op Titelpagina voor A. Kircher, Oedipus Aegyptiacus, Rome 1652-1654, RP-P-BI-1459.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece to Kircher's ''Oedipus Ægyptiacus''; the [[Sphinx]], confronted by Kircher's learning, admits he has solved her [[riddle]].]]

Between 1650 and 1654, Kircher published four volumes of "translations" of hieroglyphs in the context of his Coptic studies.<ref name="Frimmer38"/> However, according to Steven Frimmer, "none of them even remotely fitted the original texts".<ref name="Frimmer38"/> In ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'', Kircher argued under the impression of the ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'' that [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]] was the language spoken by [[Adam and Eve]], that [[Hermes Trismegistus]] was [[Moses]], and that hieroglyphs were [[occult]] [[symbol]]s which "cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures." This led him to translate the simple hieroglyphic text ''ḏd Wsr'' ("Osiris says") as "The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis; the moisture of nature is guarded by the vigilance of Anubis"<ref>for such translations, see e.g. his ''Sphinx mystagoga'', p. 49.</ref>

Egyptologist [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] mentioned Kircher as the foremost of writers who "pretended to have found the key to the hieroglyphics" and called his translations in ''Oedipus Aegyptiacus'' "utter nonsense, but as they were put forth in a learned tongue many people at the time believed they were correct."<ref name="Budge">{{cite book |title=Egyptian Language: Easy Lessons in Egyptian Hieroglyphics |last= Budge |first= E. A. Wallis |author-link=E. A.

The data which he collected were later consulted by [[Champollion]] in his successful efforts to decode the script. According to Joseph MacDonnell, it was "because of Kircher's work that scientists knew what to look for when interpreting the Rosetta stone".<ref>MacDonnell, p 12 <!--quoted by Woods, p 109--></ref> Another scholar of ancient Egypt, Erik Iversen, concluded:
{{Blockquote|It is, therefore, Kircher's incontestable merit that he was the first to have discovered the phonetic value of an Egyptian hieroglyph. From a humanistic as well as an intellectual point of view Egyptology may very well be proud of having Kircher as its founder.<ref>Iversen, pp 97–98 <!--quoted by Woods, p 109; via MacDonnell, p 12--></ref>}}

Kircher was also actively involved in the erection of the [[Obeliscus Pamphilius|Pamphilj obelisk]], and added "hieroglyphs" of his design in the blank areas.<ref name="Fletcher2011">{{cite book|author=John Edward Fletcher|title=A Study of the Life and Works of Athanasius Kircher, 'Germanus Incredibilis': With a Selection of His Unpublished Correspondence and an Annotated Translation of His Autobiography.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Wo-w2sl6zEC&pg=PA549|date=25 August 2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-20712-7|pages=549–}}</ref> Rowland 2002 concluded that Kircher made use of Pythagorean principles to read hieroglyphs of the [[Obeliscus Pamphilius|Pamphili Obelisk]], and used the same form of interpretation when reading scripture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/1/777777122590|author=Ingrid D.

====Sinology====
[[File:Kircherchinamap.jpg|thumb|350px|Map of China, ''China Illustrata''.]]
{{see also|Jesuit China missions}}

Kircher had an early interest in [[China]], telling his superior in 1629 that he wished to become a [[missionary]] to that country. In 1667 he published a treatise whose full title was  ''China monumentis, qua sacris qua profanis, nec non variis naturae & artis spectaculis, aliarumque rerum memorabilium argumentis illustrata'', and which is commonly known simply as ''[[China Illustrata]]'', i.e. "China Illustrated". It was a work of encyclopedic breadth, combining material of unequal quality, from  accurate [[cartography]] to mythical elements, such as a study of [[dragon]]s. The work drew heavily on the reports of Jesuits working in China, in particular [[Michael Boym]]<ref>{{citation|first=Hartmut |last=Walravens |url=http://www.haraldfischerverlag.de/hfv/Digital/walravens.pdf |title=Michael Boym und die Flora Sinensis |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927152210/http://www.haraldfischerverlag.de/hfv/Digital/walravens.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-27 }}</ref> and [[Martino Martini]].

''China Illustrata'' emphasized the Christian elements of Chinese history, both real and imagined: the book noted the early presence of [[Nestorian Christian]]s (with a Latin translation of the [[Nestorian Stele]] of [[Xi'an]] provided by Boym and his Chinese collaborator, Andrew Zheng),<ref name=tuyl>[http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/library/kircher.pdf ''China Illustrata''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818014556/http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/library/kircher.pdf |date=August 18, 2011 }}; Modern English translation and preface by Dr Charles D. Van Tuyl</ref> but also claimed that the Chinese were descended from the sons of [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]], that [[Confucius]] was Hermes Trismegistus/Moses and that the [[Chinese character]]s were abstracted hieroglyphs.

In Kircher's system, [[ideogram]]s were inferior to hieroglyphs because they referred to specific ideas rather than to mysterious complexes of ideas, while the signs of the [[Maya civilization#Writing system|Maya]] and [[Aztec]]s were yet lower [[pictogram]]s which referred only to objects. [[Umberto Eco]] comments that this idea reflected and supported the ethnocentric European attitude toward Chinese and native American civilizations:

"China was presented not as an unknown barbarian to be defeated but as a prodigal son who should return to the home of the common father". (p.&nbsp;69)

====Biblical studies and exegesis====
In 1675, he published ''[[Arca Noë]]'', the results of his research on the biblical [[Noah's Ark|Ark of Noah]] —  following the [[Counter-Reformation]], [[Allegorical interpretation of the Bible|allegorical interpretation]] was giving way to the study of the Old Testament as literal truth among Scriptural scholars. Kircher analyzed the dimensions of the Ark; based on the number of species known to him (excluding insects and other forms thought to [[spontaneous generation|arise spontaneously]]), he calculated that overcrowding would not have been a problem. He also discussed the logistics of the Ark voyage, speculating on whether extra livestock was brought to feed carnivores and what the daily schedule of feeding and caring for animals must have been.

====Other cultural work====
Kircher was sent the [[Voynich Manuscript]] in 1666 by [[Johannes Marcus Marci]] in the hope of Kircher being able to decipher it.<ref name=nsa>{{cite book|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf |author=Tiltman, John H. |date=Summer 1967 |title=The Voynich Manuscript: "The Most Mysterious Manuscript in the World" |volume=XII |number=3 |access-date=October 30, 2011 |publisher=NSA Technical Journal |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018025101/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf |archive-date=October 18, 2011 }}</ref> The manuscript remained in the Collegio Romano until [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] annexed the [[Papal States]] in 1870, though scepticism as to the authenticity of the story and of the origin of the manuscript itself exists.  In his ''[[Polygraphia Nova]]'' (1663), Kircher proposed an artificial [[universal language]].

===Physical sciences===
====Geology====
[[File:Kircherearthfires.jpg|thumb|250px|Kircher's model of the [[Earth]]'s internal fires, from ''Mundus Subterraneus''.]]

On a visit to [[southern Italy]] in 1638, the ever-curious Kircher was lowered into the [[Volcano|crater]] of [[Vesuvius]], then on the brink of eruption, to examine its interior. He was also intrigued by the [[subterranean rumbling]] which he heard at the [[Strait of Messina]]. His geological and geographical investigations culminated in his ''[[Mundus Subterraneus (book)|Mundus Subterraneus]]'' of 1664, in which he suggested that the [[tide]]s were caused by water moving to and from a subterranean [[ocean]].

Kircher was also puzzled by [[fossil]]s. He understood that fossils were the remains of animals. He ascribed large bones to giant races of humans.<ref>Palmer, Douglas (2005) Earth Time: Exploring the Deep Past from Victorian England to the Grand Canyon. Wiley, Chichester. {{ISBN|978-0-470-02221-4}}</ref> Not all the objects which he was attempting to explain were in fact fossils, hence the diversity of explanations. He interpreted mountain ranges as the Earth's skeletal structures exposed by weathering.<ref>''The Earth'' – Richard Fortey, Harper Perennial 2004</ref>

[[File:Atlantis_Kircher_Mundus_subterraneus_1678.jpg|thumb|250px| Kircher's map of [[Atlantis]], oriented with south at the top, from ''Mundus Subterraneus''.]]

''Mundus Subterraneus'' includes several pages about the legendary island of [[Atlantis]] including a map with the Latin caption "Situs Insulae Atlantidis, a Mari olim absorpte ex mente Egyptiorum et Platonis Description," translating as "Site of the island of Atlantis, in the sea, from Egyptian sources and Plato's description."<ref>{{cite web|title=Map of the lost island of Atlantis|url=https://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/20754|work=raremaps.com|access-date=16 February 2013}}</ref>

====Biology====
In his book ''[[Arca Noë]]'', Kircher argued that after the Flood new species were transformed as they moved into different environments, for example, when a [[deer]] moved into a colder climate, it became a [[reindeer]]. He wrote that many species were hybrids of other species, for example, [[armadillo]]s from a combination of [[turtle]]s and [[porcupine]]s. He also advocated the theory of [[spontaneous generation]].<ref>O Breidbach, MT Ghiselin (2006). ''Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680) on Noah's Ark: Baroque "Intelligent Design" Theory'', Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences, Volume 57, No. 36, pp. 991–1002 <{{cite web|url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/scipubs/pdfs/v57/proccas_v57_n36.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009153435/http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/scipubs/pdfs/v57/proccas_v57_n36.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-09 }}></ref> Because of such hypotheses, some historians have held that Kircher was a proto-evolutionist.<ref>Fairfield Osborn, Henry (1902) From the Greeks to Darwin: An Outline of the Development of the Evolution Idea. MacMillan: London, page 106</ref>

====Medicine====
[[File:Kircherears.jpg|thumb|right|The [[ear]]s of a human, cow, horse, dog, leopard, cat, rat, pig, sheep and goose illustrated in ''Musurgia Universalis''.]]

Kircher took a modern approach to the study of [[disease]]s as early as 1646 by using a [[microscope]] to investigate the [[blood]] of [[Black Death|plague]] victims. In his ''[[Scrutinium Physico-Medicum|Scrutinium Pestis]]'' of 1658, he observed the presence of "little worms" or "[[animalcules]]" in the blood and concluded that the disease was caused by [[microorganism]]s. That was correct, although it is likely that what he saw were [[red blood cell|red]] or [[white blood cell|white]] [[blood cell]]s and not the plague agent, ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. He also proposed [[hygiene|hygienic]] measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as isolation, [[quarantine]], burning clothes worn by the infected and wearing facemasks to prevent the inhalation of [[Microorganism|germ]]s.

===Technology===
[[File:Kirchermagneticclock.jpg|thumb|250px|Kircher's magnetic clock.]]

In 1646, Kircher published ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'', concerning the display of images on a screen using an apparatus similar to the [[magic lantern]] developed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] and others. Kircher described the construction of a "catoptric lamp" that used reflection to project images on the wall of a darkened room. Although Kircher did not invent the device, he improved it, and suggested methods by which exhibitors could use his device. Much of the significance of his work arises from Kircher's rational approach towards the demystification of projected images.<ref>Musser, p 613</ref>

Previously,  such images had been used in Europe to mimic supernatural appearances (Kircher himself cites the use of displayed images by the rabbis in the court of [[King Solomon]]). Kircher stressed that exhibitors should take great care to inform spectators that such images were purely naturalistic, and not magical.

Kircher constructed a [[magnetism|magnetic]] clock, which he explained in his ''Magnes'' (1641). The clock had been invented by another Jesuit, Fr. [[Linus of Liege]], and was described by an acquaintance of Line's in 1634. Kircher's patron Peiresc had claimed that the clock's motion supported the [[Copernican principle|Copernican]] cosmological model, arguing that the magnetic sphere in the clock rotated by the magnetic force of the [[sun]].<ref name="Athanasius Kircher's Magnetic Clock">[http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/kircher/intro.html Athanasius Kircher's Magnetic Clock] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816044854/http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/kircher/intro.html |date=August 16, 2010 }}, accessed 23 Apr 2011</ref>

Kircher's model disproved that hypothesis, showing that the motion could be produced by a [[water clock]] in the base of the device. Although Kircher disputed the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican]] model in his ''Magnes'', supporting instead that of [[Tycho Brahe]], his later ''[[Itinerarium exstaticum]]'' (1656, revised 1671), presented several systems&nbsp;— including the Copernican&nbsp;— as distinct possibilities. The clock has been reconstructed by Caroline Bouguereau in collaboration with Michael John Gorman and is on display at the Green Library at Stanford University.<ref name="Athanasius Kircher's Magnetic Clock"/>

The ''[[Musurgia Universalis]]'' (1650) sets out Kircher's views on [[music]]: he believed that the [[harmony]] of music reflected the proportions of the [[universe]]. The book includes plans for constructing water-powered [[automatic organ]]s, [[Musical notation|notations]] of [[bird vocalization|birdsong]] and diagrams of [[musical instrument]]s. One illustration shows the differences between the [[ear]]s of humans and other animals. In ''[[Phonurgia Nova]]'' (1673) Kircher considered the possibilities of transmitting music to remote places.

Other machines designed by Kircher include an [[aeolian harp]], [[automaton]]s such as a statue which spoke and listened via a [[speaking tube]], a [[perpetual motion machine]], and a [[Katzenklavier]] ("cat piano"). The Katzenklavier would have driven spikes into the tails of cats, which would yowl to specified [[Pitch (music)|pitches]], but was never constructed.

In ''Phonurgia Nova'', literally "new methods of sound production", Kircher examined acoustic phenomena. He explored the use of horns and cones in amplifying sound for architectural applications. He also examined echoes in rooms using domes of different shapes, including the muffling effect of an [[elliptical dome]] from Heidelberg. In one section he explored the therapeutic effects of music in [[tarantism]], a theme from southern Italy.<ref>{{cite conference|doi=10.1121/1.2992053|title=The 'Phonurgia Nova' of Athanasius Kircher: The Marvellous sound world of 17th century|pages=015002|series=Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics|year=2008|last1=Tronchin|first1=Lamberto|first2=I.|last2= Durvilli |first3= V.|last3= Tarabusi}}</ref>

===Combinatorics===
Although Kircher's work was not mathematically based, he did develop systems for generating and counting all combinations of a finite collection of objects (i.e., a finite [[Set theory|set]]), based on the previous work of [[Ramon Llull]]. His methods and diagrams are discussed in ''Ars Magna Sciendi, sive Combinatoria'', 1669. They include what may be the first recorded [[graph drawing|drawings]] of [[complete bipartite graph]]s, extending a similar technique used by Llull to visualize [[complete graph]]s.<ref>{{citation|contribution=Two thousand years of combinatorics|first=Donald E.|last=Knuth|author-link=Donald Knuth|pages=7–37|title=Combinatorics: Ancient and Modern|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|editor1-first=Robin|editor1-last=Wilson|editor2-first=John J.|editor2-last=Watkins}}.
</ref>  Kircher also employed combinatorics in his [[Arca Musarithmica]], an [[aleatoric music]] device capable of composing millions of church hymns by combining randomly selected musical phrases.

==Legacy==

===Scholarly influence===
For most of his professional life, Kircher was one of the scientific stars of his world: according to historian Paula Findlen, he was "the first scholar with a global reputation". His importance was twofold: to the results of his own [[experiment]]s and research he added information gleaned from his correspondence with over 760 scientists, physicians and above all his fellow Jesuits in all parts of the globe. The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' calls him a "one-man intellectual clearing house". His works, illustrated to his orders, were extremely popular, and he was the first scientist to be able to support himself through the sale of his books. His near-exact contemporary, the English philosopher-physician, [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605–82) collected his books avidly while his eldest son Edward Browne in 1665 visited the Jesuit priest resident at Rome. Towards the end of Kircher's life, however, his stock fell, as the [[rationalism|rationalist]] [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] approach began to dominate (Descartes himself described Kircher as "more quacksalver than savant").

===Cultural legacy===
Kircher was largely neglected until the late 20th century. One writer attributes his rediscovery to the similarities between his eclectic approach and [[postmodernism]].

As few of Kircher's works have been translated, the contemporary emphasis has been on their [[aesthetic]] qualities rather than their actual content, and a succession of exhibitions have highlighted the beauty of their illustrations. Historian [[Anthony Grafton]] has said that "the staggeringly strange dark continent of Kircher's work [is] the setting for a [[Borges]] story that was never written", while [[Umberto Eco]] has written about Kircher in his novel ''[[The Island of the Day Before]]'', as well as in his non-fiction works ''[[The Search for the Perfect Language]]'' and ''[[Serendipities]]''. In the historical novel [[Imprimatur (novel)|Imprimatur]] by [[Monaldi & Sorti]] (2002), Kircher plays a major role. Shortly after his death, some travelers are locked up in a hotel in Baroque Rome by the papal health authorities because of an epidemic of plague. Kircher's theory about the healing power of music is remembered by the protagonists in various flashbacks and finally provides the key to the puzzle. In ''Where Tigers Are At Home'', by [[Jean-Marie Blas de Roblès]], the protagonist works on a  translation of a bogus 17th-century biography of  Kircher. The contemporary artist [[Cybèle Varela]] has paid tribute to Kircher in her exhibition ''Ad Sidera per Athanasius Kircher'', held in the {{Lang|it|[[Collegio Romano]]|italic=no}}, in the same place where the [[Museum Kircherianum]] was.

The [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] in [[Los Angeles]] has a hall dedicated to the life of Kircher. His ethnographic collection is in the [[Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography]] in Rome.

John Glassie's book, ''[[A Man of Misconceptions]],'' traces connections between Kircher and figures such as [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. It also suggests influences on [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Franz Anton Mesmer]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]].

In the end, Glassie writes, Kircher should be acknowledged “for his effort to know everything and to share everything he knew, for asking a thousand questions about the world around him, and for getting so many others to ask questions about his answers; for stimulating, as well as confounding and inadvertently amusing, so many minds; for having been a source of so many ideas—right, wrong, half-right, half-baked, ridiculous, beautiful, and all-encompassing.”<ref>Glassie, p 272.</ref>

==In popular culture==
Kircher's life and research are central to the plot of [[James Rollins|James Rollin's]] 2015 novel ''The Bone Labyrinth''.

He is also mentioned in ''[[The Book of Life (Harkness novel)|The Book of Life]]'', the third book in the All Souls Trilogy by [[Deborah Harkness]].

He further appears in two separate episodes in [[Daniel Kehlmann|Daniel Kehlmann's]] novel ''[[Tyll (novel)|Tyll]]'' (2017).

The permanent exhibition ''The World Is Bound with Secret Knots'' at the [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] is based on the life and work of Kircher and uses elaborate 3D technology to highlight the magical quality of many of his ideas and images.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mjt.org/exhibits/kircher/Knots.html|title=The World is Bound With Secret Knots|website=Museum of Jurassic Technology|access-date=May 13, 2020}}</ref>

He is also a character (though largely off-stage, he is often mentioned by other characters) in the "[[Ring of Fire (series)|Ring of Fire]]" alternate history series (published by Baen). In it, he was sent back to Germany in the early 1630s, where he became the unofficial pastor of the Catholic church in the temporally-transplanted town of Grantville, Thuringia-Franconia.

Kircher features as a favourite author of [[Benedykt Chmielowski|Father Chmielowski]] in [[Olga Tokarczuk]]'s ''[[The Books of Jacob]]''.
