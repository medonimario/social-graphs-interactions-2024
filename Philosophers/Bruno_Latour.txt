'''Bruno Latour''' ({{IPA|fr|latuʁ|lang}}; 22 June 1947 – 9 October 2022) was a French philosopher, anthropologist and sociologist.<ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 189">Wheeler, Will.

He retired from several university activities in 2017.<ref>See Latour's "Biography" [http://www.bruno-latour.fr/biography Bruno Latour's official website]</ref> He was also a Centennial Professor at the [[London School of Economics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/instructor/brunolatour|title=Bruno Latour, Instructor – Coursera|website=Coursera|access-date=17 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://english.nd.edu/events/2016/11/03/bruno-latour/|title=Bruno Latour // Events // Department of English // University of Notre Dame|first=ENR/PAZ // Marketing Communications: Web // University of Notre|last=Dame|website=english.nd.edu|access-date=17 May 2018|archive-date=1 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101143859/http://english.nd.edu/events/2016/11/03/bruno-latour/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Latour is best known for his books ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]'' (1991; English translation, 1993), ''[[Laboratory Life]]'' (with [[Steve Woolgar]], 1979) and ''[[Science in Action (book)|Science in Action]]'' (1987).<ref name = "Anthropolists-Bio">Heather Vidmar-McEwen,[http://www.indiana.edu/~wanthro/theory_pages/Latour.htm "Anthropologists biographies: Bruno Latour"], "Anthropologists biographies: Bruno Latour", Indiana University Anthropology Department</ref> Although his studies of scientific practice were at one time associated with [[social constructionist]]<ref name="Anthropolists-Bio"/> approaches to the philosophy of science, Latour diverged significantly from such approaches. He was best known for withdrawing from the subjective/objective division and re-developing the approach to work in practice.<ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 189"/> Latour said in 2017 that he is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |author-link=Kendrick Frazier|title='Science Wars' Veteran Latour Now Wants to Help Rebuild Trust in Science |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |page=7}}</ref>
Along with [[Michel Callon]], [[Madeleine Akrich]], and [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], Latour is one of the primary developers of [[actor–network theory]] (ANT), a constructionist approach influenced by the [[ethnomethodology]] of [[Harold Garfinkel]], the generative [[semiotics]] of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], and (more recently) the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]]'s rival [[Gabriel Tarde]].

==Biography==
Latour was related to a well-known family of winemakers from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] known as [[Maison Louis Latour]], but was not associated with the similarly named [[Château Latour]] estate in [[Bordeaux]].<ref>Blok, A. & Elgaard Jensen, T. ''Bruno Latour: hybrid thoughts in a hybrid world''. London: Routledge, 2011.</ref>

As a student, Latour originally focused on philosophy. In 1971–1972, he ranked second and then first (''reçu second, premier'') in the French national competitive exam {{Lang|fr|[[agrégation]]}}/''[[CAPES de philosophies]]''. Latour went on to earn his PhD degree in [[philosophical theology]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Skirbekk|first1=Gunnar|title=Bruno Latour's anthropology of the moderns|url=http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/commentary/bruno-latours-anthropology-of-the-moderns|website=Radicalphilosophy.com|access-date=5 January 2015}}</ref> at the [[François Rabelais University|University of Tours]] in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~wanthro/theory_pages/Latour.htm|title="Bruno Latour" by Heather Vidmar-McEwen|access-date=17 May 2018}}</ref> His thesis title was ''Exégèse et ontologie: une analyse des textes de resurrection'' (''Exegesis and Ontology: An Analysis of the Texts of Resurrection''). 

Latour developed an interest in [[anthropology]], and undertook fieldwork in [[Ivory Coast]], on behalf of [[Institut de recherche pour le développement|ORSTOM]], which resulted in a brief monograph on decolonization, race, and industrial relations.<ref name = "Anthropolists-Bio"/>  In the 1990s, he engaged in a series of dialogues with [[Michel Serres]] that were published as ''Eclaircissements (Conversations on Science, Culture and Time)''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Serres|first1= Michel  |last2=Latour|first2=Bruno |date=1995|title=Conversations on Science, Culture, and Time: Michel Serres with Bruno Latour |series=Studies In Literature And Science|translator-last1=  Lapidus|translator-first1=Roxanne |publisher= [[University of Michigan]] Press|isbn=978-0472065486}}</ref>

After spending more than twenty years (1982–2006) at the [[Centre de sociologie de l'innovation]] at the [[École des Mines]] in Paris, Latour moved in 2006 to [[Sciences Po]], where he was the first occupant of a chair named for [[Gabriel Tarde]]. In recent years he also served as one of the curators of successful art exhibitions at the [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie]] in [[Karlsruhe]], Germany, including "Iconoclash" (2002) and "Making Things Public" (2005). In 2005, he also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Amsterdam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/philosophy/home/components-centrecolumn/the-spinoza-chair.html|title=The Spinoza Chair – Philosophy – University of Amsterdam|first=Universiteit van|last=Amsterdam|website=www.uva.nl|access-date=17 May 2018}}</ref>

== Main works ==

===''Laboratory Life''===
[[File:REAL- Making Things Public (2352262494).jpg|thumb|''Making Things Public'' : [[Installation art|installation]] [[mock-up]] with Latour's image at Buell Hall, [[Columbia University]], [[New York City|New York]], 2004.|left]]
After his early career efforts, Latour shifted his research interests to focus on laboratory scientists. Latour rose in importance{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} following the 1979 publication of ''Laboratory Life: the Social Construction of Scientific Facts'' with co-author [[Steve Woolgar]]. In the book, the authors undertake an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] study of a [[neuroendocrinology]] research laboratory at the [[Salk Institute]].<ref name = "Anthropolists-Bio"/> This early work argued that naïve descriptions of the [[scientific method]], in which theories stand or fall on the outcome of a single experiment, are inconsistent with actual laboratory practice.

In the laboratory, Latour and Woolgar observed that a typical experiment produces only inconclusive data that is attributed to failure of the apparatus or experimental method, and that a large part of scientific training involves learning how to make the subjective decision of what data to keep and what data to throw out. Latour and Woolgar argued that, for untrained observers, the entire process resembles not an unbiased search for truth and accuracy but a mechanism for ignoring data that contradicts scientific orthodoxy.

Latour and Woolgar produced a highly heterodox and controversial picture of the sciences. Drawing on the work of [[Gaston Bachelard]], they advance the notion that the objects of scientific study are ''socially constructed'' within the laboratory—that they cannot be attributed with an existence outside of the instruments that measure them and the minds that interpret them. They view scientific activity as a system of beliefs, oral traditions and culturally specific practices—in short, science is reconstructed not as a procedure or as a set of principles but as a culture. Latour's 1987 book ''[[Science in Action (book)|Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society]]'' is one of the key texts of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] in which he famously wrote his Second Principle as follows: "Scientist and engineers speak in the name of new allies that they have shaped and enrolled; representatives among other representatives, they add these unexpected resources to tip the balance of force in their favor."

Some of Latour's position and findings in this era provoked vehement rebuttals. Gross and Leavitt argue that Latour's position becomes absurd when applied to non-scientific contexts: e.g., if a group of coworkers in a windowless room were debating whether or not it were raining outside and went outdoors to discover raindrops in the air and puddles on the soil, Latour's hypothesis would assert that the rain was socially constructed.<ref>Gross, Paul R. and Levitt, Norman (1997). ''[[Higher Superstition]]: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science.'' Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 58</ref> Similarly, philosopher [[John Searle]]<ref>Searle, John R. (2009) "Why Should You Believe It?" ''The New York Review of Books'', 24 September 2009.</ref> argues that Latour's "extreme social constructivist" position is seriously flawed on several points, and furthermore has inadvertently "comical results".

===''The Pasteurization of France''===
After a research project examining the sociology of [[primatology|primatologists]], Latour followed up the themes in ''Laboratory Life'' with ''[[Les Microbes: guerre et paix]]'' (published in English as ''The Pasteurization of France'' in 1988). In it, he reviews the life and career of one of France's most famous scientists [[Louis Pasteur]] and his discovery of microbes, in the fashion of a political biography. Latour highlights the social forces at work in and around Pasteur's career and the uneven manner in which his theories were accepted. By providing more explicitly ideological explanations for the acceptance of Pasteur's work more easily in some quarters than in others, he seeks to undermine the notion that the acceptance and rejection of scientific theories is primarily, or even usually, a matter of experiment, evidence or reason.

===''Aramis, or The Love of Technology''===
[[Aramis, or the Love of Technology|''Aramis, or The Love of Technology'']] focuses on the history of an unsuccessful mass-transit project. [[Aramis (personal rapid transit)|Aramis]] PRT (personal rapid transit), a high tech automated subway, had been developed in France during the 70s and 80s and was supposed to be implemented as a personal rapid transit system in Paris. It combined the flexibility of an automobile with the efficiency of a subway. Aramis was to be an ideal urban transportation system based on private cars in constant motion and the elimination of unnecessary transfers. This new form of transportation was intended to be as secure and inexpensive as collective transportation. The proposed system had custom-designed motors, sensors, controls, digital electronics, software and a major installation in southern Paris. But in the end the project died in 1987. Latour argues that the technology failed not because any particular actor killed it, but because the actors failed to sustain it through negotiation and adaptation to a changing social situation. While investigating Aramis's demise, Latour delineates the tenets of [[Actor–network theory|actor-network theory]]. According to Latour's own description of the book,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bruno-latour.fr/fr/node/106.html|title=Aramis or the Love of Technology &#124; bruno-latour.fr|website=www.bruno-latour.fr}}</ref> the work aims "at training readers in the booming field of technology studies and at experimenting in the many new literary forms that are necessary to handle mechanisms and automatisms without using the belief that they are mechanical or automatic."

===''We Have Never Been Modern''===
Latour's work ''Nous n'avons jamais été modernes : Essai d'anthropologie symétrique'' was first published in French in 1991, and then in English in 1993 as ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]''.

Latour encouraged the reader of this anthropology of science to re-think and re-evaluate our mental landscape. He evaluated the work of scientists and contemplated the contribution of the [[scientific method]] to knowledge and work, blurring the distinction across various fields and disciplines.<ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 190">Wheeler, Will. ''Bruno Latour: Documenting Human and Nonhuman Associations'' Critical Theory for Library and Information Science. Libraries Unlimited, 2010, p. 190.</ref>

Latour argued that society has never really been modern and promoted nonmodernism (or amodernism) over [[postmodernism]], [[modernism]], or antimodernism.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=47, 134}} His stance was that we have never been modern and minor divisions alone separate Westerners now from other collectives.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=47, 114}} Latour viewed modernism as an era that believed it had annulled the entire past in its wake.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=69}} He presented the antimodern reaction as defending such entities as spirit, rationality, liberty, society, God, or even the past.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=47}} Postmoderns, according to Latour, also accepted the modernistic abstractions as if they were real.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=48}} In contrast, the nonmodern approach reestablished symmetry between science and technology on the one hand and society on the other.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=138}} Latour also referred to the impossibility of returning to premodernism because it precluded the large scale experimentation which was a benefit of modernism.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=140}}

Latour attempted to prove through case studies the fallacy in the old object/subject and Nature/Society compacts of modernity, which can be traced back to Plato.<ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 190"/>{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=79}} He refused the concept of "out there" versus "in here".<ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 192">Wheeler, Will. ''Bruno Latour: Documenting Human and Nonhuman Associations'' Critical Theory for Library and Information Science. Libraries Unlimited, 2010, p. 192.</ref> He rendered the object/subject distinction as simply unusable and charted a new approach towards knowledge, work, and circulating reference.<ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 192"/> Latour considered nonmoderns to be playing on a different field, one vastly different to that of post-moderns.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=48}} He referred to it as much broader and much less polemical, a creation of an unknown territory, which he playfully referred to as the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=48}}

In 1998, historian of science Margaret C. Jacob argued that Latour's politicized account of the development of modernism in the 17th century is "a fanciful escape from modern Western history".<ref>Jacob, Margaret C (1998). "Latour's Version of the Seventeenth Century," pp. 240–254 in ''A House Built on Sand: Exposing Postmodernist Myths About Science'', [[Noretta Koertge]] (editor), NY: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-511725-5}}</ref>

===''Pandora's Hope''===
''Pandora's Hope'' (1999) marks a return to the themes Latour explored in ''Science in Action'' and ''We Have Never Been Modern''. It uses independent but thematically linked essays and case studies to question the authority and reliability of scientific knowledge. Latour uses a narrative, anecdotal approach in a number of the essays, describing his work with [[pedology (soil study)|pedologists]] in the Amazon rainforest, the development of the pasteurization process, and the research of French atomic scientists at the outbreak of the Second World War. Latour states that this specific, anecdotal approach to science studies is essential to gaining a full understanding of the discipline: "The only way to understand the reality of science studies is to follow what science studies do best, that is, paying close attention to the details of scientific practice" (p.&nbsp;24). Some authors have criticized Latour's methodology, including Katherine Pandora, a history of science professor at the University of Oklahoma. In her review of ''Pandora's Hope'', Katherine Pandora states:
<blockquote>
"[Latour's] writing can be stimulating, fresh and at times genuinely moving, but it can also display a distractingly mannered style in which a rococo zeal for compounding metaphors, examples, definitions and abstractions can frustrate even readers who approach his work with the best of intentions (notwithstanding the inclusion of a nine-page glossary of terms and liberal use of diagrams in an attempt to achieve the utmost clarity)".<ref name="Pandora">{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/science-studies-study |title=Science Studies Study ยป American Scientist |access-date=25 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515142825/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/science-studies-study |archive-date=15 May 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
</blockquote>
In addition to his epistemological concerns, Latour also explores the political dimension of science studies in ''Pandora's Hope''. Two of the chapters draw on [[Gorgias (dialogue)|Plato's ''Gorgias'']] as a means of investigating and highlighting the distinction between content and context. As Katherine Pandora states in her review:
<blockquote>
"It is hard not to be caught up in the author's obvious delight in deploying a classic work from antiquity to bring current concerns into sharper focus, following along as he manages to leave the reader with the impression that the protagonists Socrates and Callicles are not only in dialogue with each other but with Latour as well."<ref name="Pandora" />
</blockquote>
Although Latour frames his discussion with a classical model, his examples of fraught political issues are all current and of continuing relevance: global warming, the spread of mad cow disease, and the carcinogenic effects of smoking are all mentioned at various points in ''Pandora's Hope''. In Felix Stalder's article "Beyond constructivism: towards a realistic realism", he summarizes Latour's position on the political dimension of science studies as follows: "These scientific debates have been artificially kept open in order to render impossible any political action against these problems and those who profit from them".<ref name="Stalder">{{cite web|url=http://felix.openflows.com/html/pandora.html|title=Felix Stalder: Latour's Pandora's Hope (Review)|website=felix.openflows.com|access-date=17 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323213234/http://felix.openflows.com/html/pandora.html|archive-date=23 March 2019}}</ref>

==="Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam?"===
In a 2004 article,<ref>Latour, Bruno. (2004) [http://winteranthology.com/?vol=5&author=latour&title=critique "Why Has Critique Run out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern"]. ''Critical Inquiry'', Vol. 30, No. 2, Winter 2004, pp. 225–248</ref> Latour questioned the fundamental premises on which he had based most of his career, asking, "Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies?" He undertakes a trenchant critique of his own field of study and, more generally, of social criticism in contemporary academia. He suggests that critique, as currently practiced, is bordering on irrelevancy. To maintain any vitality, Latour argues that social critiques require a drastic reappraisal: "our critical equipment deserves as much critical scrutiny as the Pentagon budget." (p.&nbsp;231) To regain focus and credibility, Latour argues that social critiques must embrace [[empiricism]], to insist on the "cultivation of a stubbornly realist attitude – to speak like [[William James]]". (p.&nbsp;233)

Latour suggests that about 90 per cent of contemporary social criticism displays one of two approaches which he terms "the fact position and the fairy position." (p.&nbsp;237) The fairy position is [[fetishism|anti-fetishist]], arguing that "objects of belief" (e.g., religion, arts) are merely concepts created by the projected wishes and desires of the "naive believer"; the "fact position" argues that individuals are dominated, often covertly and without their awareness, by external forces (e.g., economics, gender). (p.&nbsp;238) "Do you see now why it feels so good to be a critical mind?" asks Latour: no matter which position you take, "You're always right!" (p.&nbsp;238–239) Social critics tend to use anti-fetishism against ideas they personally reject; to use "an unrepentant positivist" approach for fields of study they consider valuable; all the while thinking as "a perfectly healthy sturdy realist for what you really cherish." (p.&nbsp;241) These inconsistencies and [[double standards]] go largely unrecognized in social critique because "there is never any crossover between the two lists of objects in the fact position and the fairy position." (p.&nbsp;241)

The practical result of these approaches being taught to millions of students in elite universities for several decades is a widespread and influential "critical barbarity" that has—like a malign virus created by a "[[mad scientist]]"—thus far proven impossible to control. Most troubling, Latour notes that critical ideas have been appropriated by those he describes as [[conspiracy theorists]], including [[global warming denial|global warming deniers]] and the [[9/11 Truth movement]]: "Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief, punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique." (p.&nbsp;230)

The conclusion of the article is to argue for a positive framing of critique, to help understand how matters of concern can be supported rather than undermined: "The critic is not the one who lifts the rugs from under the feet of the naïve believers, but the one who offers the participants arenas in which to gather. The critic is not the one who alternates haphazardly between antifetishism and positivism like the drunk iconoclast drawn by [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], but the one for whom, if something is constructed, then it means it is fragile and thus in great need of care and caution."

Latour's article has been highly influential within the field of [[postcritique]], an intellectual movement within [[literary criticism]] and [[cultural studies]] that seeks to find new forms of reading and interpretation that go beyond the methods of [[critique]], [[critical theory]], and [[ideological criticism]]. The literary critic [[Rita Felski]] has named Latour as an important precursor to the project of postcritique.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Limits of Critique|last=Felski|first=Rita|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-226-29403-2|location=Chicago|pages=150}}</ref>

===''Reassembling the Social''<!--linked from 'Actor–network theory'-->===
In ''Reassembling the Social'' (2005),<ref name = "Primary">Latour, Bruno. ''Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor–Network Theory''. Oxford, UK: Oxford UP, 2005.</ref> Latour continues a reappraisal of his work, developing what he calls a "practical [[metaphysics]]", which calls "real" anything that an actor (one whom we are studying) claims as a source of motivation for action. So if someone says, "I was inspired by God to be charitable to my neighbors" we are obliged to recognize the "[[ontological]] weight" of their claim, rather than attempting to replace their belief in God's presence with "social stuff", like class, gender, [[imperialism]], etc. Latour's nuanced metaphysics demands the existence of a plurality of worlds, and the willingness of the researcher to chart ever more. He argues that researchers must give up the hope of fitting their actors into a structure or framework, but Latour believes the benefits of this sacrifice far outweigh the downsides: "Their complex metaphysics would at least be respected, their recalcitrance recognized, their objections deployed, their multiplicity accepted."<ref name="Primary" />

For Latour, to talk about [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]]—what really is—means paying close empirical attention to the various, contradictory institutions and ideas that bring people together and inspire them to act. Here is Latour's description of metaphysics:
<blockquote>
If we call metaphysics the discipline inspired by the philosophical tradition that purports to define the basic structure of the world, then empirical metaphysics is what the controversies over agencies lead to since they ceaselessly populate the world with new drives and, as ceaselessly, contest the existence of others. The question then becomes how to explore the actors' own metaphysics.<ref name="Primary" />
</blockquote>
A more traditional metaphysicist might object, arguing that this means there are multiple, contradictory realities, since there are "controversies over agencies" – since there is a plurality of contradictory ideas that people claim as a basis for action (God, nature, the state, sexual drives, personal ambition, and so on). This objection manifests the most important difference between traditional philosophical metaphysics and Latour's nuance: for Latour, there is no "basic structure of reality" or a single, self-consistent world. An unknowably large multiplicity of realities, or "worlds" in his terms, exists–one for each actor's sources of [[agency (sociology)|agency]], inspirations for action.  In this Latour is remarkably close to [[B.F. Skinner]]'s position in [[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]] and the philosophy of [[Radical Behaviorism]].  Actors bring "the real" (metaphysics) into being. The task of the researcher is not to find one "basic structure" that explains agency, but to recognize "the metaphysical innovations proposed by ordinary actors".<ref name="Primary" /> Mapping those metaphysical innovations involves a strong dedication to [[relativism]], Latour argues. The relativist researcher "learns the actors' language," records what they say about what they do, and does not appeal to a higher "structure" to "explain" the actor's motivations. The relativist "takes seriously what [actors] are obstinately saying" and "follows the direction indicated by their fingers when they designate what 'makes them act'". The relativist recognizes the plurality of metaphysics that actors bring into being, and attempts to map them rather than reducing them to a single structure or explanation.

[[Alan Sokal]], in his ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'', criticized Latour's relativism by referring to an article written by Latour in ''[[La Recherche]]'' in 1998. In his reaction to research showing that the pharaoh [[Ramses II]] probably died of [[tuberculosis]], Latour thought "How could he pass away due to a bacillus discovered by [[Robert Koch|Koch]] in 1882? ... Before Koch, the bacillus has no real existence." He says that it is as much of an anachronism as it would be to claim that the pharaoh died of machine-gun fire.<ref name="sa">{{cite book |last1=Sokal |first1=Alan |last2=Bricmont |first2=Jean |title=Fashionable Nonsense |date=1999 |publisher=Picador |location=USA |pages=96–97}}</ref><ref name="Boghossian">{{cite book |last1=Boghossian |first1=Paul A. |author-link=Paul Boghossian |title=Fear of Knowledge: Against Relativism and Constructivism |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=019928718X |page=26}}</ref>
