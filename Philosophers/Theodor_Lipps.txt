'''Theodor Lipps''' ({{IPA|de|lɪps|lang}}; 28 July 1851 – 17 October 1914) was a German philosopher, known for his theory regarding [[aesthetics]], creating the framework for the concept of ''Einfühlung'' ([[empathy]])'',''  defined as, "projecting oneself onto the object of [[perception]]."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodor-Lipps|title=Theodor Lipps {{!}} German psychologist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref> This has then led onto opening up a new branch of [[interdisciplinary]] research in the overlap between psychology and philosophy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Robin|last2=Elliott|first2=Richard George|date=December 2014|title=An Introduction to Einfühlung|journal=Art in Translation|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=353–376|doi=10.1080/17561310.2014.11425535|s2cid=161752306|issn=1756-1310}}</ref>

==Biography==
Lipps was one of the most influential German university professors of his time, attracting many students from other countries. Lipps was very concerned with conceptions of art and the aesthetic, focusing much of his philosophy around such issues. Among his fervent admirers was [[Sigmund Freud]]. There were at least two theories that made an impact on Freud's works. The first was Lipps' theory of the unconscious mental events.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=D. L.|title=Freud's Philosophy of the Unconscious|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7923-5882-4|location=Dordrecht|pages=16|language=en}}</ref> Lipps was then a main supporter of the idea of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].<ref>Pigman, G. W.

=== ''Einfühlung'' ===
He adopted [[Robert Vischer]]'s notions of [[empathy]] or esthetic sympathy (''Einfühlung'', literally translated to "feeling-into"). He was responsible for popularizing the term by modifying Vischer's conceptualization.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last1=Buse|first1=Peter|title=Benjamin's Arcades: An Unguided Tour|last2=Hirschkop|first2=Ken|last3=Taithe|first3=Bertrand|last4=McCracken|first4=Scott|date=2006-09-19|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0-7190-6988-2|location=Manchester, UK|pages=74|language=en}}</ref> Particularly, Lipps concealed some of the thinker's mysticism, hiding it within the sphere of scientific psychology in his work, ''Aesthetics of Space and Geometrical Illusions''.<ref name=":4" /> The term was used to describe the process of contemplating art objects as representation of our feelings.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Dean|first=Carolyn J.|title=The Fragility of Empathy after the Holocaust|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8014-4162-5|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=6}}</ref> Lipps developed it into an aesthetic theory, which was refined further by other thinkers such as Roger Fry and Vernon Lee.<ref name=":1" /> This concept of aesthetic resonance finds parallels throughout aesthetic philosophy. In this concept, empathy is said to begin with both the object and the pleasure drawn together in a single act instead of a separate object with which we have aesthetic enjoyment or with pleasure taken in an object.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Berleant|first=Arnold|title=Art And Engagement|publisher=Temple University Press|year=1993|isbn=0-87722-797-7|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=16}}</ref> According to Lipps, empathy incorporates movement or activity, which is bound up with observed object by: 1) being derived from it; and, 2) by being inseparable from it.<ref name=":2" /> For his works, he is considered one of the most important representatives of the psychology of aesthetics alongside [[Stephan Witasek]] and [[Johannes Volkelt]].<ref>Allesch, Christian G.. (2013). "STEPHAN WITASEK UND DIE PSYCHOLOGISCHE ÄSTHETIK". ''The Aesthetics of the Graz School'', edited by Venanzio Raspa, Berlin, Boston: De Gruyter, pp. 113-128.</ref>

=== Psychologism ===
Lipps was an important adherent of psychologism early in his career. This philosophy was based on the Neo-Kantianism that became influential in German philosophy during the second half of the nineteenth century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Simissen|first=Herman|title=Theodor Lessing's Philosophy of History in Its Time|publisher=BRILL|year=2021|isbn=978-90-04-46476-6|location=Leiden|pages=59|language=en}}</ref> He became a spokesman of this school as evidenced in his early publications.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Simissen|first=Herman|title=Theodor Lessing's Philosophy of History in Its Time|publisher=BRILL|year=2020|isbn=9780190251765|location=New York|pages=59|language=en}}</ref> In his work, ''Logik'' (1893), he declared his "unlimited foundational logical psychologism", which is based on a partial identity of psychology of thinking and the logic of thinking.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last=Jacquette |first=Dale |title=Philosophy, Psychology, and Psychologism: Critical and Historical Readings on the Psychological Turn in Philosophy |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |year=2006 |isbn=1-4020-1337-X |location=Dordrecht |pages=88–89}}</ref> Here, logic is considered the "physics of thinking" rather than an "ethics of thinking".<ref name=":3" /> According to Lipps, "logic is a psychological discipline, as certain as the cognition occurs only in the psyche, and the thinking, which completes itself in the cognition, is a psychical event."<ref name=":3" />

Late in life, Lipps adopted some ideas from [[Edmund Husserl]] as he developed in another direction. Disliking his [[psychologism]], some of his students joined with some of Husserl's to form a new branch of philosophy called [[phenomenology of essences]]. Among them there was [[Moritz Geiger]] who wrote one of the first phenomenological essays on the [[essence]] and meaning of empathy in which the influence of Lipps is relevant.<ref>Gödel, Florian (2015), "An Introduction to Moritz Geiger’s Psychological Contribution on Empathy." ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''8'''(1):161–8.</ref> There was also [[:de:Paul F. Linke|Paul Ferdinand Linke]] who studied under Lipps at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat]] and dealt with Husserlian phenomenology in his first publication, ''Die phaenomenale Sphaere''.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Staiti|first1=Andrea|title=The Sources of Husserl's 'Ideas I'|last2=Clarke|first2=Evan|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG|year=2018|isbn=978-3-11-055159-4|location=Berlin/Boston|pages=383|language=en}}</ref>

In the so-called aesthetics of "oughtness", Lipps attempted to reconcile "ought" with "is".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fizer|first=John|title=Psychologism and Psychoaesthetics|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=1981|isbn=9027215065|location=Amsterdam|pages=223|language=en}}</ref>
