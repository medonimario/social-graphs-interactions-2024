His old teacher Aggrey had died in 1929 in the US, and in 1942, Nkrumah led traditional prayers for Aggrey at the graveside.

==Return to the Gold Coast==

=== United Gold Coast Convention ===

The 1946 Gold Coast constitution gave Africans a majority on the [[Legislative council|Legislative Council]] for the first time. Seen as a major step towards self-government,{{sfn|Rooney|pp=26–27}} the new arrangement prompted the colony's first true political party, founded in August 1947, the [[United Gold Coast Convention]] (UGCC).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ghana pays tribute to founders' – Graphic Online|url=https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/politics/ghana-pays-tribute-to-founders.html|access-date=5 August 2020|website=www.graphic.com.gh|date=4 August 2020 |language=en-gb|archive-date=14 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210214131116/https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/politics/ghana-pays-tribute-to-founders.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The UGCC sought self-government as quickly as possible. Since the leading members were all successful professionals, they needed to pay someone to run the party, and their choice fell on Nkrumah at the suggestion of [[Ebenezer Ako Adjei|Ako Adjei]]. Nkrumah hesitated but realized that the UGCC was controlled by conservative interests and noted that the new post could open huge political opportunities for him and accepted. After being questioned by British officials about his communist affiliations, Nkrumah boarded the MV ''Accra'' at Liverpool in November 1947 for the voyage home.{{sfn|Owusu-Ansah|p=316}}{{sfn|Rooney|pp=27–28}}

After brief stops in [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], and the [[Ivory Coast]], he arrived in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] where he briefly stayed and reunited with his mother in [[Tarkwa, Ghana|Tarkwa]]. He began work at the party's headquarters in [[Saltpond, Ghana|Saltpond]] on 29 December 1947 where he worked as a general secretary.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>{{sfn|Rooney|pp=30–31}} Nkrumah quickly submitted plans for branches of the UGCC to be established colony-wide, and for strikes if necessary to gain political ends. This activist stance divided the party's governing committee, which was led by [[J. B. Danquah]]. Nkrumah embarked on a tour to gain donations for the UGCC and establish new branches.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=36–37}}

Although the Gold Coast was more developed politically than Britain's other [[West Africa]]n colonies, there was considerable discontent. Postwar inflation had caused public anger at high prices, leading to a boycott of small businesses run by Arabs which began in January 1948. Local [[cocoa bean]] farmers were upset because trees exhibiting [[cacao swollen-shoot virus]], but still capable of yielding a crop, were being destroyed by the colonial authorities.<ref>{{Citation|title=VIII.

Nkrumah and Danquah addressed a meeting of the Ex-Service men's Union in Accra on 20 February 1948, which was made in advance of a planned march to present a petition to the governor. When the march took place on 28 February, three veterans were killed by police gunfire, prompting the [[1948 Accra riots]], which spread throughout the country.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=38–39}} According to Nkrumah's biographer, David Birmingham, "West Africa's erstwhile "model colony" witnessed a riot and business premises were looted. The African Revolution had begun."{{sfn|Birmingham|pp=18–19}}

The colonial government assumed that the UGCC was responsible for the unrest, and arrested six leaders, including Nkrumah and Danquah. [[The Big Six (Ghana)|The Big Six]] were incarcerated together in [[Kumasi]],{{sfn|Addo|p=85}} increasing the rift between Nkrumah and the others, who blamed him for the riots and their detention. After the colonial government learned that there were plots to storm the prison, the six were separated, with Nkrumah sent to [[Lawra]]; all six were freed in April 1948.

Beginning in April 1949, there was considerable pressure on Nkrumah from his supporters to leave the UGCC and form his own party.<ref name="mkgandhi.org">{{Cite web|title=Kwame Nkrumah: Non-Violence of Mahatma Gandhi in Ghana {{!}} Articles : On and By Gandhi|url=https://www.mkgandhi.org/articles/nonviolence-of-Mahatma-Gandhi-in-Ghana.html|website=www.mkgandhi.org|access-date=27 May 2020|archive-date=3 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803020635/https://www.mkgandhi.org/articles/nonviolence-of-Mahatma-Gandhi-in-Ghana.html|url-status=live}}</ref> On 12 June 1949, he announced the formation of the [[Convention People's Party]] (CPP), with the word "convention" chosen, according to Nkrumah, "to carry the masses with us".{{sfn|Addo|p=88}} There were attempts to heal the breach with the UGCC; at one July meeting, it was agreed to reinstate Nkrumah as secretary and disband the CPP. But Nkrumah's supporters would not have it, and persuaded him to refuse the offer and remain at their head.{{sfn|Addo|pp=88–89}}

The CPP adopted the red [[cockerel]] as its symbol – a familiar icon for local ethnic groups, and a symbol of leadership, alertness, and masculinity.<ref name=Hagan2 />{{sfn|Fuller|pp=24–26}} Party symbols and colours (red, white, and green) appeared on clothing, flags, vehicles and houses.<ref name=Hagan2 /> CPP operatives drove red-white-and-green vans across the country, playing music and rallying public support for the party and especially for Nkrumah. These efforts were wildly successful, especially because previous political efforts in the Gold Coast had focused exclusively on the urban intelligentsia.<ref name=Hagan2 />

The British convened a selected commission of middle-class Africans, including all of the Big Six except Nkrumah, to draft a new constitution that would give the Gold Coast more self-government. Nkrumah saw, even before the commission reported, that its recommendations would fall short of full [[dominion]] status, and began to organize a [[Positive Action]] campaign.<ref name="Running away from our own shadows"/> Nkrumah demanded a [[constituent assembly]] to write a constitution. When the governor, [[Charles Arden-Clarke]], would not commit to this, Nkrumah called for positive action, with the unions beginning a [[general strike]] to begin on 8 January 1950. The strike quickly led to violence, and Nkrumah and other CPP leaders were arrested on 22 January, and the ''Evening News'' was banned.<ref name="BIRTH OF THE CPP">{{Citation|date=15 November 2007|work=Kwame Nkrumah.

Nkrumah's assistant, [[Komla Agbeli Gbedemah]], ran the CPP in his absence; the imprisoned leader was able to influence events through smuggled notes written on toilet paper.

Nkrumah stood, from prison, for a directly elected Accra seat. Gbedemah worked to set up a nationwide campaign organization, using vans with loudspeakers to blare the party's message. The UGCC failed to set up a nationwide structure, and proved unable to take advantage of the fact that many of its opponents were in prison.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=56–57}}

In the [[1951 Gold Coast legislative election|February 1951 legislative election]], the first general election to be held under universal franchise in colonial Africa, the CPP was elected in a landslide.{{sfn|Birmingham|pp=34–35}} The CPP secured 34 of the 38 seats contested on a party basis, with Nkrumah elected for his Accra constituency. The UGCC won three seats, and one was taken by an independent. Arden-Clarke saw that the only alternative to Nkrumah's freedom was the end of the constitutional experiment. Nkrumah was released from prison on 12 February, receiving a rapturous reception from his followers.{{sfn|Bourret|pp=175–177}} The following day, Arden-Clarke sent for him and asked him to form a government.{{sfn|Rooney|p=61}}

Nkrumah had stolen Arden-Clarke's secretary [[Erica Powell]] after she was dismissed and sent home for getting too close to Nkrumah.

=== Leader of Government Business and Prime Minister ===

Nkrumah faced several challenges as he assumed office. He had never served in government, and needed to learn that art. The Gold Coast was composed of four regions, several former colonies amalgamated into one. Nkrumah sought to unite them under one nationality, and bring the country to independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=International Migration Outlook: SOPEMI - 2008 Edition - OECD 2008 – ISBN 9789264045651|title=Table B.1.6. Acquisition of nationality by country of former nationality, Denmark|doi=10.1787/432756801382}}</ref> Key to meeting the challenges was convincing the British that the CPP's programmes were not only practical, but inevitable, and Nkrumah and Arden-Clarke worked closely together.<ref name="mkgandhi.org"/> The governor instructed the civil service to give the fledgling government full support, and the three British members of the cabinet took care not to vote against the elected majority.{{sfn|Birmingham|pp=37–38}}

Prior to the CPP taking office, British officials had prepared a ten-year plan for development. With demands for infrastructure improvements coming in from all over the colony, Nkrumah approved it in general, but halved the time to five years.<ref>{{Cite report |last=Cipriani|first=Ralph J.|date=1 December 2014|title=SNL Five-Year Facilities & Infrastructure Plan FY2015-2019|doi=10.2172/1173199|osti=1173199}}</ref> The colony was in good financial shape, with reserves from years of cocoa profit held in London, and Nkrumah was able to spend freely. Modern trunk roads were built along the coast and within the interior. The rail system was modernized and expanded. Modern water and sewer systems were installed in most towns, where housing schemes were begun.<ref>{{Cite web|title=External Engagement Experiences from Ghana and Mozambique|url=https://media.africaportal.org/documents/REPORT_6_2005_-_EXTERNAL_ENGAGEMENT_-_EXPERIENCES_FROM_GHANA_AND_MOZAMBIQUE.pdf|last=Sidiropoulos|first=Elizabeth|date=2005|website=Media Africa|access-date=27 May 2020|archive-date=2 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802234800/https://media.africaportal.org/documents/REPORT_6_2005_-_EXTERNAL_ENGAGEMENT_-_EXPERIENCES_FROM_GHANA_AND_MOZAMBIQUE.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> Construction began on a new harbour at [[Tema]], near Accra, and the existing port, at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]], was expanded. An urgent programme to build and expand schools, from primary to teacher and trade training, was begun.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} From 1951 to 1956, the number of pupils being educated at the colony's schools rose from 200,000 to 500,000.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=82–83}} Nevertheless, the number of graduates being produced was insufficient to the burgeoning civil service's needs, and in 1953, Nkrumah announced that though Africans would be given preference, the country would be relying on expatriate European civil servants for several years.{{sfn|Bourret|p=178}}

Nkrumah's title was Leader of Government Business in a cabinet chaired by Arden-Clarke. Quick progress was made, and in 1952, the governor withdrew from the cabinet, leaving Nkrumah as his prime minister, with the portfolios that had been reserved for expatriates going to Africans.<ref name=":1">Grimm, Kevin E., Symbol of Modernity: Ghana, African Americans, and the Eisenhower Administration.

This was uncontroversial until it became clear that it would be implemented by the CPP. That party's majority in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Gold Coast|Legislative Assembly]] passed legislation in late 1951 that shifted power from the chiefs to the chairs of the councils, though there was some local rioting as [[rates (tax)|rates]] were imposed.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=181–182}}

Nkrumah's re-titling as prime minister had not given him additional power, and he sought constitutional reform that would lead to independence. In 1952, he consulted with the visiting [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], [[Oliver Lyttelton]], who indicated that Britain would look favorably on further advancement, so long as the chiefs and other stakeholders had the opportunity to express their views.<ref name=":0" /> Initially skeptical of Nkrumah's socialist policies, Britain's [[MI5]] had compiled large amounts of intelligence on Nkrumah through several sources, including tapping phones and mail interception under the code name of SWIFT.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walton |first1=Calder |title=British Intelligence, the Cold War, and the Twilight of Empire |publisher=[[The Overlook Press]] |isbn=978-1468307153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f2cjCQAAQBAJ&q=mi5%20swift%20gold%20coast&pg=PT156 |access-date=18 January 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127091745/https://books.google.com/books?id=f2cjCQAAQBAJ&lpg=PT157&ots=rBl1byBn3w&dq=mi5%20swift%20gold%20coast&pg=PT156 |archive-date=27 January 2017 |date=29 October 2014 }}</ref> Beginning in October 1952, Nkrumah sought opinions from councils and from political parties on reform, and consulted widely across the country, including with opposition groups.

A number of opposition groups formed the [[National Liberation Movement (Ghana)|National Liberation Movement]].

The opposition was not satisfied with the plan for independence, and demanded that power be devolved to the regions. Discussions took place through late 1956 and into 1957. Although Nkrumah did not compromise on his insistence on a unitary state, the nation was divided into five regions, with power devolved from Accra, and the chiefs having a role in their governments.<ref>{{Citation|last=Mills|first=James H.|title='The British Compromise': Devolved Power and the Domestic Consumer, 1971–1997|date=29 November 2012|work=Cannabis Nation|pages=155–185|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199283422.003.0007|isbn=978-0-19-928342-2}}</ref> On 21 February 1957, the [[British prime minister]], [[Harold Macmillan]], announced that Ghana would be a full member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] with effect from 6 March.{{sfn|Bourret|pp=200–201}}

Nkrumah also sought to eliminate "[[tribalism]]", a source of loyalties held more deeply than those to the nation-state. Thus, as he wrote in ''Africa Must Unite'': "We were engaged in a kind of war, a war against poverty and disease, against ignorance, against tribalism and disunity.

In 1962, three younger members of the CPP were brought up on charges of taking part in a plot to blow up Nkrumah's car in a motorcade. The sole evidence against the alleged plotters was that they rode in cars well behind Nkrumah's car.<ref name="BIRTH OF THE CPP"/> When the defendants were acquitted, Nkrumah sacked the chief judge of the state security court, then got the CPP-dominated parliament to pass a law allowing a [[Double jeopardy|new trial]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kayaoglu|first=Barin|date=12 April 2017|title=Turkey's last Ergenekon trial ends as all defendants acquitted |work=Al-Monitor |doi=10.26598/auis_ug_is_2017_04_12 |doi-access=free}}</ref> At this second trial, all three men were convicted and sentenced to death, though these sentences were subsequently commuted to life imprisonment.

===Education===

In 1951, the CPP created the Accelerated Development Plan for Education. This plan set up a six-year primary course, to be attended as close to universally as possible, with a range of possibilities to follow.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Franker|first1=Karen|last2=James|first2=Dennis|date=2016|title=The Course Development Plan: Macro-Level Decisions and Micro-Level Processes|journal=New Directions for Higher Education|volume=2016|issue=173|pages=43–53|doi=10.1002/he.20178|issn=0271-0560}}</ref> All children were to learn arithmetic, as well as gain "a sound foundation for citizenship with permanent literacy in both English and the vernacular." Primary education became [[compulsory education|compulsory]] in 1962. The plan also stated that religious schools would no longer receive funding, and that some existing missionary schools would be taken over by government.<ref name=Haizel />

In 1961, Nkrumah laid the first stones in the foundation of the [[Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute]] created to train Ghanaian civil servants as well as promote Pan-Africanism.

In 1964, Nkrumah brought forth the Seven Year Development Plan for National Reconstruction and Development, which identified education as a key source of development and called for the expansion of secondary technical schools.<ref>{{Cite report |date=1976 |title=First seven year economic and social development plan, 1355–1361 (Mar. 76-Mar. 83). |doi=10.2458/azu_acku_hc417_a57_1976_v2 |doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Secondary education would also include "in-service training programmes". As Nkrumah told Parliament: "Employers, both public and private, will be expected to make a far greater contribution to labour training through individual factory and farm schools, industry-wide training schemes, day release, payment for attendance at short courses and evening classes."

Nkrumah was an ardent promoter of [[pan-Africanism]], seeing the movement as the "quest for regional integration of the whole of the African continent". The period of Nkrumah's active political involvement has been described as the "golden age of high pan-African ambitions"; the continent had experienced [[African nationalism|rising nationalist movements]] and [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonization by most European colonial powers]], and historians have noted that "the narrative of rebirth and solidarity had gained momentum within the pan-Africanist movement". Reflecting his African heritage, Nkrumah frequently eschewed [[Western dress codes|Western fashion]], donning a [[Ghanaian smock|fugu]] (a Northern attire) made with Southern-produced [[Kente cloth]], a symbol of his identity as a representative of the entire country.<ref name="books.google.fr">Mkandawire, P.

A campaign against nudity in the northern part of the country received special attention from Nkrumah, who reportedly deployed Propaganda Secretary [[Hannah Kudjoe|Hannah Cudjoe]] to respond.

In 1957, Nkrumah created a well-funded [[Ghana News Agency]] to generate domestic news and disseminate it abroad.

==== Energy projects ====

[[Kaiser Aluminum]] agreed to build the dam for Nkrumah, but restricted what could be produced using the power generated. Nkrumah borrowed money to build the dam, and placed Ghana in debt. To finance the debt, he raised taxes on the cocoa farmers in the south. This accentuated regional differences and jealousy. The dam was completed and opened by Nkrumah amidst global publicity on 22 January 1966.

Nkrumah initiated the Ghana [[Nuclear reactor|Nuclear Reactor]] Project in 1961, created the [[Ghana Atomic Energy Commission]] in 1963, and in 1964 laid the first stone in the building of an atomic energy facility.<ref>{{cite book |author=GAEC Documentation Committee |date=July 1998 |title=Ghana Atomic Energy Commission: At a Glance |url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/29/061/29061226.pdf |location=Kwabenya |publisher=RPB, GAEC |edition=Third |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820202553/http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/29/061/29061226.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=FoundationStone>"[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=122255 Nkrumah lays foundation for atomic reactor .. in 1964] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403015024/http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=122255 |date=3 April 2015 }}", ''Ghana Review International'' 120, March 2007 (on ''GhanaWeb'', 11 April 2007).

==== Cocoa ====

In 1954 the world price of cocoa rose from £150 to £450 per ton. Rather than allowing cocoa farmers to keep the windfall, Nkrumah appropriated the increased revenue via central government levies, then invested the capital into various national development projects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pakaya|first1=Abdurrahman|last2=Halid|first2=Amir|last3=Payuyu|first3=Hermanto|date=18 November 2018|title=Development and supply strategy of cocoa commodity effect to cocoa farmers revenue in Boalemo District|journal=Jurnal Perspektif Pembiayaan Dan Pembangunan Daerah|volume=6|issue=2|pages=223–234|doi=10.22437/ppd.v6i2.5212|s2cid=169596736|issn=2355-8520|doi-access=free}}</ref> This policy alienated one of the major constituencies that helped him come to power.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03E3D7173CE03ABC4850DFB467838F649EDE |title=Cocoa Price Issue Splits Gold Coast |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 December 1954 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305125816/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03E3D7173CE03ABC4850DFB467838F649EDE |archive-date=5 March 2016 }}</ref>

Prices continued to fluctuate. In 1960 one ton of cocoa sold for £250 in London. By August 1965 this price had dropped to £91, one fifth of its value ten years before.<ref name=Gebe /> The quick price decline caused the government's reliance on the reserves and forced farmers to take a portion of their earning in bonds.<ref>Kolavalli, Shashi, and Marcella Vigneri.

In the [[Year of Africa]], 1960, Nkrumah negotiated the creation of a [[Union of African States]], a political alliance between Ghana, Guinea, and Mali.

Nkrumah was a leading figure in the short-lived [[Casablanca Group]] of African leaders, which sought to achieve pan-African unity and harmony through deep political, economic, and military integration of the continent in the early 1960s prior to the establishment of the [[Organisation of African Unity|Organization of African Unity]] (OAU).<ref>{{Citation|title=Pan-Africanism and African Unity|work=African Political Thought|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|doi=10.1057/9781137062055.0008|doi-broken-date=13 November 2024 |isbn=978-1-137-06205-5}}</ref><ref>[[Pierre Englebert]] & Kevin C.

Nkrumah opposed the entry of African states into the Common Market of the [[European Economic Community]], a status given to many former French colonies and considered by Nigeria.

==== Armed forces ====

In 1956, the Gold Coast took control of the [[Royal West African Frontier Force]] (RWAFF), [[Gold Coast Regiment]], from the British War Office. This force had formerly been deployed to quell internal dissent, and occasionally to fight in wars: most recently, in World War II, against the Japanese in India and Burma.<ref>{{Citation|title=Butler, Captain John Fitshardinge Paul, ((20 Dec. 1888 – 4 Sept. 1916), KRRC; attached Pioneer Company, Gold Coast Regiment, West African Frontier Force|date=1 December 2007|work=Who Was Who|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u194250}}</ref> The most senior officers in this force were British, and, although training of African officers began in 1947, only 28 of 212 officers in December 1956 were indigenous Africans. The British officers still received British salaries, which vastly exceeded those allotted to their Ghanaian counterparts. Concerned about a possible military coup, Nkrumah delayed the placement of African officers in top leadership roles.<ref name=Hutchful>Eboe Hutchful, "The Development of the Army Officer Corps in Ghana, 1956–1955", ''Journal of African Studies'' 12.3, Fall 1985.</ref><ref>Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', pp. 22–32.</ref>

Nkrumah quickly established the [[Ghanaian Air Force]], acquiring 14 ''[[de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver|Beaver]]'' airplanes from Canada and setting up a flight school with British instructors. ''[[de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter|Otters]]'', ''[[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|Caribou]],'' and ''[[de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|Chipmunks]]'' were to follow.<ref name=Hutchful /> Ghana also obtained four [[Ilyushin Il-18|Ilyushin-18]] aircraft from the Soviet Union. Preparation began in April 1959 with assistance from India and Israel.<ref>Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', p. 75.</ref> Nkrumah also established a gliding school led by [[Hanna Reitsch]] and [[J.E.S. de Graft-Hayford]].

The [[Ghanaian Navy]] received two inshore minesweepers with 40mm and 20mm guns, the ''Afadzato'' and the ''Yogaga'', from Britain in December 1959. It subsequently received the ''Elmina'' and the ''Komenda'', seaward defence boats with 40-millimetre guns.<ref name=Hutchful /> The Navy's flagship, and training ship, was the ''Achimota'', a British yacht constructed during World War II. In 1961, the Navy ordered two 600-ton corvettes, the ''Keta'' and ''Kromantse,'' from [[Vospers|Vosper & Company]] and received them in 1967. It also procured four Soviet patrol boats. Naval officers were trained at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] in Dartmouth.<ref>Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', p. 74.</ref> The Ghanaian military budget rose each year, from $9.35 million (US dollars) in 1958 to $47 million in 1965.<ref>Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', pp. 67–68.</ref>

The first international deployment of the Ghanaian armed forces was to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo (Léopoldville/Kinshasa)]], where Ghanaian troops were airlifted in 1960 at the beginning of the [[Congo Crisis]].<ref name=Hutchful /> One week after Belgian troops occupied the lucrative mining province of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], Ghana dispatched more than a thousand of its own troops to join a United Nations force.<ref name=Beynahm93>Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', p. 93. "Within a week, 1,193 Ghanaian soldiers were in Léopoldvile and 192 more were waiting for transport in Accra with 156 trucks and 160 tons of stores. In terms of its resources, Ghana made one of the heaviest manpower contributions to the Congo. By the end of August 1960, she had 2,394 army officers and men in the country. The Ghana contingent remained for three of the four years of the UN operations, contributing a total of more than 39,000-man-months."</ref> The use of British officers in this context was politically unacceptable, and this event occasioned a hasty transfer of officer positions to Ghanaians.<ref name=Hutchful /><ref>Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', p. 94.</ref> The Congo war was long and difficult.<ref name=Beynahm93 /> On 19 January 1961 the Third Infantry Battalion mutinied.

In assessing Nkrumah's legacy, [[Edward Luttwak]] argued that he was undone by the growth of [[political consciousness]] and his inability to repress potential opponents:

{{Blockquote
|text=Nkrumah, in spite of his eccentricities, was largely defeated by his own success: the by-product of the considerable economic development achieved by Ghana was to stimulate and educate the masses and the new elite; their attitude to Nkrumah's regime became more and more critical in the light of the education the regime itself provided. When this happens, more and more repression and propaganda are needed to maintain political stability. In spite of considerable efforts, Nkrumah was unable to build a sufficiently ruthless police system. The cause of his downfall was not, therefore, the mismanagement of the economy—which was considerable—but rather the success of much of the development effort.

Nkrumah generally took a [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] Marxist perspective on economics, and believed [[capitalism]] had malignant effects that were going to stay with Africa for a long time.<ref>{{Citation|last=Catephores|first=George|title=Capitalism and crisis|date=1989|work=An Introduction to Marxist Economics|pages=127–146|place=London|publisher=Macmillan Education UK|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-19707-1_6|isbn=978-0-333-46102-0}}</ref> Although he was clear on distancing himself from the [[African socialism]] of many of his contemporaries, Nkrumah argued that [[socialism]] was the system that would best accommodate the changes that capitalism had brought, while still respecting African values.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=Frank|date=2000|title=If we had a theory of political ecology, what would it look like?|journal=Capitalism Nature Socialism|volume=11|issue=2|pages=77–82|doi=10.1080/10455750009358916|s2cid=143879004|issn=1045-5752}}</ref> He specifically addresses these issues and his politics in a 1967 essay entitled "African Socialism Revisited":
<blockquote>We know that the traditional African society was founded on principles of egalitarianism. In its actual workings, however, it had various shortcomings. Its humanist impulse, nevertheless, is something that continues to urge us towards our all-African socialist reconstruction. We postulate each man to be an end in himself, not merely a means; and we accept the necessity of guaranteeing each man [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] for his development. The implications of this for sociopolitical practice have to be worked out scientifically, and the necessary social and economic policies pursued with resolution. Any meaningful humanism must begin from egalitarianism and must lead to objectively chosen policies for safeguarding and sustaining [[egalitarianism]]. Hence, socialism. Hence, also, [[scientific socialism]].<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/nkrumah/1967/african-socialism-revisited.htm Kwame Nkrumah, "African Socialism Revisited", 1967.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427045237/http://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/nkrumah/1967/african-socialism-revisited.htm |date=27 April 2014 }}</ref></blockquote><!--
  THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN GATHERED FROM THE GERMAN WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE -- it does not make sense as it stands:

[[Paulin J. Hountondji|Paulin Hountondji]] has emphasised the breaks in the thinking of Nkrumah. During the early Nkrumah on the continuity of socialism in relation to, communalism 'of the' traditional Africa's insistence, an idealised image of pre-colonial Africa (draws no exploitation of man by man) and himself a disciple [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|of Gandhi]] understands, sees the late Nkrumah necessity of a violent break with the [[Neocolonialism|neo-colonial]] relations, the struggle against [[imperialism]] and its African allies. In ''African Socialism Revisited'' Nkrumah therefore rejects the idea of an "African socialism" in the sense [[Julius Nyerere|Nyerere]], one of the "''ideology of continuity''" ([[Paulin J. Hountondji|Hountondji]] left) was arrested from.{{cn}}

During the early works of Nkrumah, he emphasised that in pre-colonial Africa there is no [[class struggle]] have been made, rejects the late Nkrumah, the fetishisation of pre-colonial Africa. "Nkrumah will never have imagined back Africa as a special world, but he accepted that our societies to the same laws are subject like any other country in the world, and that the African revolution, if properly understood, is inextricably linked to the world revolution."{{cn}}

In ''Africa Must Unite'' (1963) Nkrumah called for the immediate formation of a pan-African government. Later he demanded a unification movement that emanates from the base, arguing that between anti-imperialist governments and Western-backed "puppet regimes" there could be no common ground.{{cn}}
-->

Nkrumah was also best-known politically for his strong commitment to and promotion of [[pan-Africanism]]. He was inspired by the writings of black intellectuals such as [[Marcus Garvey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], and [[George Padmore]], and his relationships with them. Much of his understanding and relationship to these men was created during his years in America as a student.<ref>{{Citation|title=In The Shadow Of His Father|date=31 December 2003|work=S/He Created Them|pages=43–52|place=Piscataway, NJ, USA|publisher=Gorgias Press|doi=10.31826/9781463209193-011|isbn=978-1-4632-0919-3}}</ref> Some would argue that his greatest inspiration was Marcus Garvey,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Getachew|first=Adom|title=Worldmaking after Empire: The Rise and Fall of Self-Determination|date=2019|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-17915-5|pages=8|doi=10.2307/j.ctv3znwvg|jstor=j.ctv3znwvg|s2cid=242525007}}</ref> although he also had a meaningful relationship with [[C. L. R. James]]. Nkrumah looked to these men to craft a general solution to the ills of Africa. To follow in these intellectual footsteps Nkrumah had intended to continue his education in London, but found himself involved in direct activism.<ref>{{Citation|title=How, when he had besieged Chambly, another castle of the same Matthew, a sudden storm forced his host to flee, so that if Louis himself had not bravely fought back, the host would have nearly been destroyed; and how Matthew himself gave satisfaction to him with humility|work=The Deeds of Louis the Fat|year=2012|pages=32–34|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|doi=10.2307/j.ctt3fgq60.12|isbn=978-0-8132-2094-9}}</ref> Then, motivated by advice from Du Bois, Nkrumah decided to focus on creating peace in Africa. He became a passionate advocate of the "African Personality", embodied in the slogan "Africa for the Africans", earlier popularised by Edward Wilmont Blyden, and he viewed political independence as a prerequisite for economic independence.<ref name="Martin"/> Nkrumah's dedications to pan-Africanism in action attracted these intellectuals to his Ghanaian projects. Many Americans, such as Du Bois and [[Kwame Ture]], moved to Ghana to join him in his efforts. Du Bois and Ture are buried there today.<ref>Afari-Gyan, Kwadwo. "Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore and W. E. B. Du Bois", ''Research Review (NS)'' vol. 7 (1991): 1–5. Print.</ref> His press officer for six years was the Grenadian anticolonialist [[Sam Morris (activist)|Sam Morris]]. Nkrumah's biggest success in this area was his significant influence in the founding of the [[Organisation of African Unity]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sheehan|first=Michael|date=1990|title=Organisation of African Unity 25 years on: essays in honour of Kwame Nkrumah|journal=International Affairs|volume=66|issue=2|pages=426|doi=10.2307/2621454|jstor=2621454|issn=1468-2346}}</ref>

Nkrumah also became a symbol for black liberation in the United States. When in 1958 the [[Metropolitan Black Bar Association|Harlem Lawyers Association]] had an event in Nkrumah's honour, diplomat [[Ralph Bunche]] told him:

<blockquote>We salute you, Kwame Nkrumah, not only because you are Prime Minister of Ghana, although this is cause enough. We salute you because you are a true and living representation of our hopes and ideals, of the determination we have to be accepted fully as equal beings, of the pride we have held and nurtured in our African origin, of the freedom of which we know we are capable, of the freedom in which we believe, of the dignity imperative to our stature as men.<ref>{{Citation|title=The More We Typed, the Better We Felt|date=2012-09-15|work=Because You Have To|pages=103–106|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|doi=10.2307/j.ctvpj74n2.16|isbn=978-0-268-07984-0}}</ref><ref name=Asamoah /></blockquote>

In 1961, Nkrumah delivered a speech called "I Speak Of Freedom". During this speech he talked about how "Africa could become one of the greatest forces for good in the world".<ref name=1961nkrumah>[https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1961nkrumah.html "Modern History Sourcebook: Kwame Nkrumah: I Speak of Freedom, 1961"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331012334/http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1961nkrumah.html |date=31 March 2017 }}. Fordham University.</ref> He mentions how Africa is a land of "vast riches" with mineral resources from that "range from gold and diamonds to uranium and petroleum".<ref name=1961nkrumah/> Nkrumah says that the reason Africa is not thriving right now is because the European powers have been taking all the wealth for themselves. If Africa could be independent of European rule, he said, then it could truly flourish and contribute positively to the world. In the ending words of this speech Nkrumah calls his people to action by saying "This is our chance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nkrumah|first=Bright|date=2018-12-01|title=Words that Wound: Rethinking Online Hate Speech in South Africa|journal=Alternation: Interdisciplinary Journal for the Study of the Arts and Humanities in Southern Africa|volume=SP23|pages=108–133|doi=10.29086/2519-5476/2018/sp23a6|s2cid=187741200|issn=1023-1757|doi-access=free}}</ref> We must act now.

==Cultural depictions==

In the 2010 book ''[[The Other Wes Moore]],'' Nkrumah, during his time in the United States, is noted to have served as a mentor to the author's grandfather for several months upon the [[immigration]] of the author's family into the country.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Moore, Wes |title=The other Wes Moore: one name, two fates|year=2010|isbn=978-0-385-52819-1|edition=First|location=New York, New York|oclc=430839083 |publisher=Spiegel & Grau}}</ref>

Nkrumah is played by [[Danny Sapani]] in the [[Netflix]] television series ''[[The Crown (TV series)|The Crown]]'' (season 2, episode 8 "Dear Mrs Kennedy"). The show's portrayal of the historical significance of the Queen's visit to Ghana and dance with Nkrumah has been described as exaggerated in one source interviewing Nat Nuno-Amarteifio, later mayor of Accra, who was a teenage student at the time.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/01/21/578674702/netflixs-the-crown-says-one-dance-changed-history-the-truth-isn-t-so-simple |title='The Crown' Says One Dance Changed History.

''African's Black Star: The Legacy of Kwame Nkrumah'' is a 2011 film about the rise and fall of this colonial rebellion leader.
