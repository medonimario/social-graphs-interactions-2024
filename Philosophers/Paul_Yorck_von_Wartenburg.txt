{{Short description|German lawyer, writer, and philosopher (1835–1897)}}
'''Hans Ludwig David Paul, ''Graf'' Yorck von Wartenburg''' (1 April 1835 – 12 September 1897) was a German lawyer, writer, and philosopher.

==Life==
[[Graf| Graf (Count)]] Yorck was descended from the Prussian general [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg]]. His father Hans David Ludwig (1805-1865) and his mother Bertha von Brause (1809-1845) were both related to Prussian military families. They lived in Klein Öls Castle, now part of the Oława district in Poland. His nephew was the jurist [[Peter Yorck von Wartenburg]], who opposed Hitler.<ref>Hünermann, Peter, ''Der Durchbruch geschichtlichen Denkens im 19. Jahrhundert''. Herder, Freiburg/Basel/Wien 1967, p. 294.</ref>

After graduating from high school in 1854 in Breslau, Yorck enrolled at the University of Bonn, where he studied law and philosophy. In 1855 he moved to Breslau to continue his studies. In 1857 he traveled with his father Louis to Italy, starting an Italian diary of his own, which he continued on subsequent trips.

In Berlin he married, on 3 October 1860, Luise von Wildenbruch (1838-1918), niece of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia and the older sister of the writer Ernst von Wildenbruch (1845-1909).

He moved to Potsdam in 1861, where he took the exam to become an assessor. In 1865, after his father's death, he managed the family properties that included an olive grove and the family castle.

In the late 1870s, he met [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], with whom he became friends and correspondent for over twenty years (1877-1897) on philosophical subjects.

Yorck developed a [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] philosophy of history in exchange with his friend Dilthey that was significant for the hermeneutics of [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]. Their correspondence influenced the early Heidegger's philosophy of history, especially central concepts of his early thought and ''Being and Time'' such as historicity, generation, and the difference between history as lived (''Geschichte'') and as an object of inquiry (''Historie'').<ref>Farin, Ingo, "Count Paul Yorck von Wartenburg", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2016 Edition), Edward N.
