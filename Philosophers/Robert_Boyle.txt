==Biography==
===Early years===
[[File:IRL Dublin St Patrick 03.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of a young boy, thought to be Boyle, on his parents' monument in [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]].]]
Boyle was born at [[Lismore Castle]], in [[County Waterford]], Ireland, the seventh son and fourteenth child of [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork|The 1st Earl of Cork]] ('the Great Earl of Cork') and [[Catherine Fenton Boyle|Catherine Fenton]].<ref name="EB1911" /> Lord Cork, then known simply as Richard Boyle, had arrived in [[Dublin]] from [[England]] in 1588 during the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] [[plantations of Ireland]] and obtained an appointment as a deputy [[escheator]]. He had amassed enormous wealth and landholdings by the time Robert was born and had been created [[Earl of Cork]] in October 1620. Catherine Fenton, [[Countess]] of [[County Cork|Cork]], was the daughter of [[Sir Geoffrey Fenton]], the former [[Secretary of State (Ireland)|Secretary of State for Ireland]], who was born in Dublin in 1539, and Alice Weston, the daughter of [[Robert Weston]], who was born in [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]] in 1541.<ref>{{Citation|title=Catherine Fenton|work=Family Ghosts|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I4234&ged=auden-bicknell.ged|access-date=9 June 2011|archive-date=21 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055240/http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I4234&ged=auden-bicknell.ged|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As a child, Boyle was raised by a [[wet nurse]],<ref name="McCartneyWhitaker">{{citation|title=Physicists of Ireland: Passion and Precision|first1=Mark|last1=McCartney|first2=Andrew|last2=Whitaker|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|year=2003|location=London}}</ref> as were his elder brothers. Boyle received private tutoring in Latin, Greek, and French and when he was eight years old, following the death of his mother, he, and his brother Francis, were sent to [[Eton College]] in England. His father's friend, [[Sir Henry Wotton]], was then the [[Provost (education)|provost]] of the college.<ref name="EB1911" />

During this time, his father hired a private tutor, Robert Carew, who had knowledge of [[Irish language|Irish]], to act as private tutor to his sons in Eton. However, "only Mr. Robert sometimes desires it [Irish] and is a little entered in it", but despite the "many reasons" given by Carew to turn their attentions to it, "they practice the French and Latin but they affect not the Irish".<ref name="canny">{{citation|first=Nicholas|last=Canny|title=The Upstart Earl: a study of the social and mental world of Richard Boyle|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge|year=1982|page=127}}</ref> After spending over three years at Eton, Robert travelled abroad with a French tutor. They visited Italy in 1641 and remained in [[Florence]] during the winter of that year studying the "paradoxes of the great star-gazer", the elderly [[Galileo Galilei]].<ref name="EB1911" />

Robert returned to England from [[continental Europe]] in mid-1644 with a keen interest in scientific research.<ref>See biographies of Robert Boyle at [http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=522], {{cite web |title=Robert Boyle |url=http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/ci/1992/Boyle.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516022301/http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/ci/1992/Boyle.html |archive-date=16 May 2008 |access-date=6 May 2008}}, {{cite web |title=Boyle summary |url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Boyle.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413025044/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Boyle.html |archive-date=13 April 2008 |access-date=6 May 2008}} and [https://books.google.com/books?id=fjDXtalPeesC&pg=PT24].</ref> His father, [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork|Lord Cork]], had died the previous year and had left him the manor of [[Stalbridge]] in Dorset as well as substantial estates in [[County Limerick]] in Ireland that he had acquired. Robert then made his residence at [[Stalbridge#Stalbridge House|Stalbridge House]], between 1644 and 1652, and settled a laboratory where he conducted many experiments.<ref>{{Cite web|year=2014|title=BBC - History - Robert Boyle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/boyle_robert.shtml|access-date=26 September 2021|website=[[BBC Online]]}}</ref> From that time, Robert devoted his life to [[science|scientific]] research and soon took a prominent place in the band of enquirers, known as the "[[Invisible College]]", who devoted themselves to the cultivation of the "new philosophy". They met frequently in London, often at [[Gresham College]], and some of the members also had meetings at [[Oxford]].<ref name="EB1911" />
Having made several visits to his Irish estates beginning in 1647, Robert moved to Ireland in 1652 but became frustrated at his inability to make progress in his chemical work. In one letter, he described Ireland as "a barbarous country where chemical spirits were so misunderstood and chemical instruments so unprocurable that it was hard to have any Hermetic thoughts in it."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Silver|first1=Brian L.|title=The ascent of science|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-513427-8|page=114}}</ref>

In 1654, Boyle left Ireland for Oxford to pursue his work more successfully. An inscription can be found on the wall of [[University College, Oxford]], the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] at [[Oxford]] (now the location of the [[Shelley Memorial]]), marking the spot where Cross Hall stood until the early 19th century. It was here that Boyle rented rooms from the wealthy apothecary who owned the Hall.

Reading in 1657 of [[Otto von Guericke]]'s air pump, he set himself, with the assistance of [[Robert Hooke]], to devise improvements in its construction. Guericke's air pump was large and required "the continual labour of two strong men for divers hours", and Boyle constructed one that could be operated conveniently on a desktop.<ref>{{Citation |last=B. West |first=John |title=Robert Boyle's Landmark Book of 1660 with the First Experiments on Rarified Air |date=2015 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-2362-5_4 |work=Essays on the History of Respiratory Physiology |pages=37–54 |access-date=2023-03-28 |place=New York, NY |publisher=Springer New York |doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-2362-5_4 |isbn=978-1-4939-2361-8}}</ref> With the result, the "machina Boyleana" or "Pneumatical Engine", finished in 1659, he began a series of experiments on the properties of air and coined the term [[factitious airs]].<ref name=acottLaw/><ref name=EB1911/> An account of Boyle's work with the air pump was published in 1660 under the title ''New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects''.<ref name=EB1911/>

Among the critics of the views put forward in this book was a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], [[Francis Line]] (1595–1675), and it was while answering his objections that Boyle made his first mention of [[Boyle's law|the law]] that the volume of a gas varies inversely to the pressure of the gas, which among English-speaking people is usually called Boyle's Law after his name.<ref name=EB1911/> The person who originally formulated the hypothesis was [[Henry Power]] in 1661. Boyle in 1662 included a reference to a paper written by Power, but mistakenly attributed it to [[Richard Towneley]]. In continental Europe, the hypothesis is sometimes attributed to [[Edme Mariotte]], although he did not publish it until 1676 and was probably aware of Boyle's work at the time.<ref>{{cite book

In 1663 the Invisible College became [[The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge]], and the charter of incorporation granted by [[Charles II of England]] named Boyle a member of the council. In 1680 he was elected president of the society, but declined the honour from a scruple about oaths.<ref name=EB1911/>

He made a "wish list" of 24 possible [[invention]]s which included "the [[life extension|prolongation of life]]", the "[[mechanical flight|art of flying]]", "[[artificial light|perpetual light]]", "making armour light and extremely hard", "a ship to sail with all winds, and a ship [[compartment (ship)|not to be sunk]]", "practicable and certain way of finding [[longitude#Determination|longitude]]s", "potent drugs to alter or exalt imagination, waking, memory and other functions and [[analgesic|appease pain]], procure [[hypnotic|innocent sleep]], harmless dreams, etc.".

In 1668 he left Oxford for [[London]] where he resided at the house of his elder sister [[Katherine Jones, Viscountess Ranelagh|Katherine Jones, Lady Ranelagh]], in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]].<ref name=EB1911/> He experimented in the laboratory she had in her home and attended her salon of intellectuals interested in the sciences. The siblings maintained "a lifelong intellectual partnership, where brother and sister shared medical remedies, promoted each other's scientific ideas, and edited each other's manuscripts."<ref name=chf>{{cite web |url= http://www.pachs.net/events/archive/such_a_sister_became_such_a_brother_lady_ranelaghs_influence_on_robert_boyl/ |title= 'Such a Sister Became Such a Brother': Lady Ranelagh's Influence on Robert Boyle |first= Michelle |last= DiMeo |date= 4 February 2014 |access-date= 5 February 2014 |publisher= Philadelphia Area Center for History of Science |archive-date= 2 December 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161202040430/http://www.pachs.net/events/archive/such_a_sister_became_such_a_brother_lady_ranelaghs_influence_on_robert_boyl/ |url-status= dead }}</ref> His contemporaries widely acknowledged Katherine's influence on his work, but later historiographers dropped discussion of her accomplishments and relationship to her brother from their histories.

===Later years===
[[File:boyle-hooke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shelley Memorial#Boyle-Hooke plaque|Plaque]] at the site of Boyle and Hooke's experiments in Oxford]]
In 1669 his health, never very strong, began to fail seriously and he gradually withdrew from his public engagements, ceasing his communications to the Royal Society, and advertising his desire to be excused from receiving guests, "unless upon occasions very extraordinary", on Tuesday and Friday forenoon, and Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. In the leisure thus gained he wished to "recruit his spirits, range his papers", and prepare some important chemical investigations which he proposed to leave "as a kind of Hermetic legacy to the studious disciples of that art", but of which he did not make known the nature. His health became still worse in 1691,<ref name=EB1911/> and he died on 31 December that year,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Michael|title=Robert Boyle Reconsidered|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521892674|page=xvii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTq1Kr7fr6QC&pg=PR17|edition=Reprint}}</ref> just a week after the death of his sister, Katherine, in whose home he had lived and with whom he had shared scientific pursuits for more than twenty years. Boyle died from paralysis. He was buried in the churchyard of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], his funeral sermon being preached by his friend, Bishop [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref name=EB1911/> In his will, Boyle endowed a series of lectures that came to be known as the [[Boyle Lectures]].

==Scientific investigator==
[[File:Boyle air pump.jpg|thumb|right|Boyle's air pump. It illustrates: a 28.4-litre glass "receiver" (A) connected by a stopcock (S, N) to a 36-cm-long brass pumping cylinder, through which a padded piston (4) could be cranked by a toothed shaft with handle (5, 6, 7). To operate the air pump, first, the stopcock was closed, and the piston was cranked down. Then, with the stopcock opened, part of the air in the receiver moves into the cylinder. Then the stopcock was closed, the brass plug (R) removed, and the piston raised, expelling air from the cylinder. As the procedure was repeated, the air pressure in the receiver decreased.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Boas Hall |first=Marie |date=August 1967 |title=Robert Boyle |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/scientificamerican0867-96 |journal=Scientific American |volume=217 |issue=2 |pages=96–102 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0867-96 |bibcode=1967SciAm.217b..96B |issn=0036-8733}}</ref>]]
Boyle's great merit as a scientific investigator is that he carried out the principles which [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]] espoused in the ''[[Novum Organum]]''. Yet he would not avow himself a follower of Bacon, or indeed of any other teacher.<ref name=EB1911/>

On several occasions, he mentions that to keep his judgment as unprepossessed as might be with any of the modern theories of philosophy, until he was "provided of experiments" to help him judge of them. He refrained from any study of the [[atomism|atomical]] and the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] systems, and even of the Novum Organum itself, though he admits to "transiently consulting" them about a few particulars. Nothing was more alien to his mental temperament than the spinning of hypotheses. He regarded the acquisition of knowledge as an end in itself, and in consequence, he gained a wider outlook on the aims of scientific inquiry than had been enjoyed by his predecessors for many centuries. This, however, did not mean that he paid no attention to the practical application of science nor that he despised knowledge which tended to use.<ref name=EB1911/>

Robert Boyle was an [[alchemy|alchemist]];<ref name="More1941">{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2707281 |last=More |first=Louis Trenchard |title=Boyle as Alchemist |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=61–76 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |date=January 1941 |jstor=2707281}}</ref> and believing the [[wikt:Transmutation|transmutation]] of metals to be a possibility, he carried out experiments in the hope of achieving it; and he was instrumental in obtaining the repeal, by the [[Royal Mines Act 1688]] ([[1 Will. & Mar.]] c. 30), of the statute of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] against multiplying gold and silver, the [[Gold and Silver Act 1403]] ([[5 Hen. 4]]. c. 4).<ref name="sep-boyle">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=MacIntosh |first1=J. J. |last2=Anstey |first2=Peter |chapter=Robert Boyle |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boyle/notes.html#4 |year=2010 |edition=Fall |at=note 4}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/> With all the important work he accomplished in [[physics]] – the enunciation of [[Boyle's law]], the discovery of the part taken by air in the propagation of sound, and investigations on the expansive force of freezing water, on [[specific gravity|specific gravities]] and [[refraction|refractive]] powers, on [[crystal]]s, on electricity, on colour, on [[hydrostatics]], etc. – [[chemistry]] was his peculiar and favourite study. His first book on the subject was ''The Sceptical Chymist'', published in 1661, in which he criticised the "experiments whereby vulgar [[Spagyric|Spagyrists]] are wont to endeavour to evince their Salt, [[Sulphur]] and [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] to be the true Principles of Things." For him chemistry was the science of the composition of substances, not merely an adjunct to the arts of the alchemist or the physician.<ref name=EB1911/>

He endorsed the view of elements as the undecomposable constituents of material bodies; and made the distinction between [[mixture]]s and [[compound (chemistry)|compound]]s. He made considerable progress in the technique of detecting their ingredients, a process which he designated by the term "analysis". He further supposed that the elements were ultimately composed of [[Subatomic particle|particle]]s of various sorts and sizes, into which, however, they were not to be resolved in any known way. He studied the chemistry of [[combustion]] and of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], and conducted experiments in [[physiology]], where, however, he was hampered by the "tenderness of his nature" which kept him from anatomical [[dissection]]s, especially [[vivisection]]s, though he knew them to be "most instructing".<ref name=EB1911/>

==Theological interests==
In addition to philosophy, Boyle devoted much time to theology, showing a very decided leaning to the practical side and an indifference to controversial [[polemic]]s. At the [[Stuart Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England]] in 1660, he was favourably received at court and in 1665 would have received the provostship of Eton College had he agreed to take holy orders, but this he refused to do on the ground that his writings on religious subjects would have greater weight coming from a layman than a paid minister of the Church.<ref name=EB1911/>

Moreover, Boyle incorporated his scientific interests into his theology, believing that natural philosophy could provide powerful evidence for the existence of God. In works such as ''Disquisition about the Final Causes of Natural Things'' (1688),{{sfn | ''U-M Library Digital Collections''}} for instance, he criticised contemporary philosophers – such as [[René Descartes]] – who denied that the study of nature could reveal much about God. Instead, Boyle argued that natural philosophers could use the design apparently on display in some parts of nature to demonstrate God's involvement with the world. He also attempted to tackle complex theological questions using methods derived from his scientific practices. In ''Some Physico-Theological Considerations about the Possibility of the Resurrection'' (1675), he used a chemical experiment known as the reduction to the pristine state as part of an attempt to demonstrate the physical possibility of the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection of the body]]. Throughout his career, Boyle tried to show that science could lend support to Christianity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wragge-Morley|first=Alexander|title=Robert Boyle and the representation of imperceptible entities|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|volume=51|pages=1–24|doi=10.1017/S0007087417000899|pmid=29103389|issn=0007-0874|year=2018|issue=1|s2cid=4334846|url=https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10030920/}}</ref>

As a director of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]]<ref>{{A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature|wstitle=Boyle, The Hon. Robert|inline=1}}</ref> he spent large sums in promoting the spread of Christianity in the East, contributing liberally to [[missionary]] societies and to the expenses of translating the Bible or portions of it into various languages.<ref name=EB1911/> Boyle supported the policy that the Bible should be available in the vernacular language of the people. An [[Irish language]] version of the [[New Testament]] was published in 1602 but was rare in Boyle's adult life. In 1680–85 Boyle personally financed the printing of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, in Irish.<ref>{{citation|first= Talbot|last= Baines Reed |title= A History of the Old English Letter Foundries|year=1887|url= https://archive.org/details/ahistoryoldengl00reedgoog/ | pages = 189–90|publisher= Elliot Stock }}.

Boyle also had a [[monogenism|monogenist]] perspective about [[race (classification of humans)|race]] origin. He was a pioneer in studying races, and he believed that all human beings, no matter how diverse their physical differences, came from the same source: [[Adam and Eve]]. He studied reported stories of parents giving birth to different coloured [[albinos]], so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white and that Caucasians could give birth to different coloured races. Boyle also extended the theories of [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Isaac Newton]] about colour and light via optical projection (in [[physics]]) into discourses of [[polygenism|polygenesis]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boyle|first1=Jen E.|title=Anamorphosis in early modern literature : mediation and affect|date=2010|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham, Surrey, [England]|isbn=978-1409400691|page=74}}</ref> speculating that maybe these differences were due to "[[:wikt:seminal#Adjective|seminal]] impressions". Taking this into account, it might be considered that he envisioned a good explanation for [[complexion]] at his time, due to the fact that now we know that skin colour is disposed by [[genetic code|genes]], which are actually contained in the [[semen]]. Boyle's writings mention that at his time, for "European Eyes", beauty was not measured so much in [[colour of skin]], but in "stature, comely symmetry of the parts of the body, and good features in the face".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://gutenberg.org/1/4/5/0/14504 | title=Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours (1664) (ebook) | publisher=Gutenberg Project | access-date=11 October 2016 | website=www.gutenberg.net | pages=160–61}}</ref> Various members of the scientific community rejected his views and described them as "disturbing" or "amusing".<ref>{{cite book |author=Palmeri, Frank |title= Humans And Other Animals in Eighteenth-Century British Culture: Representation, Hybridity, Ethics |year=2006 |pages=49–67}}</ref>

In his will, Boyle provided money for a series of lectures to defend the [[Christianity|Christian religion]] against those he considered "notorious [[infidel]]s, namely [[Atheism|atheists]], [[Deism|deists]], [[Paganism|pagans]], Jews and Muslims", with the provision that controversies between Christians were not to be mentioned (see [[Boyle Lectures]]).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stmarylebow.co.uk/#/the-boyle-lecture/4535974239 | title = The Boyle Lecture | work = St. Marylebow Church}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/>
