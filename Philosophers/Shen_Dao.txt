{{Chinese Legalism}}
'''Shen Dao''' ({{circa|350}}{{snd}}{{circa|275&nbsp;BC}}) was a Chinese philosopher and writer. He was a [[Chinese Legalist]] theoretician most remembered for his influence on [[Han Fei]] with regards to the concept of ''shi'' ({{zhi|c=勢|l=power, potential}}, circumstantial advantage or authority), but most of his book concerns the concept of ''[[Fa (philosophy)|fa]]'' (administrative methods and standards) more commonly shared by his school. Compared with western schools, Shen Dao considered laws that are not good "still preferable to having no laws at all."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Graham |first=A. C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBzyCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA268 |title=Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China |date=2015-12-15 |publisher=Open Court |isbn=978-0-8126-9942-5 |language=en}}

Usually referred to as "Shenzi" ({{lang|zh|慎子}} 'Master Shen') for his writings, very little is known of Shen Dao's life.  An itinerant philosopher from the [[state of Zhao]], he was probably born about 350&nbsp;BC, travelling to the city of Linzi (modern [[Zibo]] in [[Shandong]]) in 300&nbsp;BC to become a member of the [[Jixia Academy]]. He probably left Linzi after its capture by the [[state of Yan]] in 285&nbsp;BC. Speculatively, he might have moved to the [[State of Han|Han kingdom]] and absorbed the Legalist traditions there. He died roughly 10 years later.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=871}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ching |first=Julia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynfrlFZcUG8C&pg=PA76 |title=Sages and Filial Sons: Mythology and Archaeology in Ancient China |last2=Guisso |first2=R.

Thompson states that the ''Shenzi'' was available until the fall of the Tang dynasty, though not in its original edition.<ref>Dao Companion to the Philosophy of Han Fei. Shen Dao's Theory of fa and His Influence on Han Fei. p. 48. Soon-ja Yang</ref> Shen Dao's own original 42 essays have been lost. With only 7 fragments still extant, he is known largely through short references and the writings of others, notably the ''[[Han Feizi]]'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''. A critical reconstruction of the lost ''Shenzi'' was made by [[Paul Thompson (sinologist)|Paul Thompson]], and published in 1979 as ''The Shen Tzu Fragments''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In 2007, the [[Shanghai Museum]] published a collection of texts written on bamboo slips from the [[Chu (state)|state of Chu]] dating to the [[Warring States period]], including six bamboo slips with sayings of Shenzi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewen.cc/books/bkview.asp?bkid=136537&cid=408155|title=《上海博物馆藏战国楚竹书（六）》将出版|date=February 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215105445/http://www.ewen.cc/books/bkview.asp?bkid=136537&cid=408155|archive-date=2012-02-15}}</ref> These are the only known examples of the text of Shenzi that are contemporaneous with its composition.

[[Xun Kuang]] considered Shen's style grandiose.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lu |first=Xing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72QURrAppzkC&pg=187 |title=Rhetoric in Ancient China, Fifth to Third Century, B.C.E.: A Comparison with Classical Greek Rhetoric |date=1998 |publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press |isbn=978-1-57003-216-5 |language=en}}</ref>

==Proto-Daoism==
Making use of the term "[[Dao]]" without cosmological or metaphysical reference,<ref>Dao Companion to the Philosophy of Han Fei. Shen Dao's Theory of fa and His Influence on Han Fei. Soon-ja Yang</ref> the Shenzi serves as noteworthy precursor to both [[Taoism|Daoism]] and [[Han Fei]]. Posthumously, he is also sometimes classified as Taoist,<ref>John Emerson 2012. p. 1. A STUDY OF SHEN DAO</ref> and [[Wang Fuzhi]] speculated that the chapter "Essay on Seeing Things as Equal" of the Zhuangzhi was actually written by Shen Dao.<ref>Hansen, Chad, "Zhuangzi", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/zhuangzi/</ref> As opposed to the egoist [[Yang Zhu]], Shen Dao is characterized by the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)]]'' as impartial and lacking selfishness, his great way embracing all things.<ref name="Antonio S p.362">Antonio S. Cua 2003 p. 362, Encyclopedia of Chinese Philosophy</ref>

[[Benjamin I. Schwarz]] characterized Shen Dao's convictions as Daoisticly indifferent, likening him to the 'inert passive clod' described in the last chapters of the ''Zhuangzi''. Schwarz takes Shen Dao as seeing the impersonal structure of political authority and human society to be expressions of the spontaneous Dao in human civilization. Shen Dao rejects individual judgment, moral agents, sages, and, like other figures of the ''[[fajia]]'', the 'subjective intentionality of noble men.' Schwarz speculates that Shen Dao's philosophy similarly involves a ruler free from the turbulence of emotion or moral responsibility. By contrast, Han Fei does not completely disregard the role of great men.<ref>Schwarz 1985 p243,319,342-343,446</ref>

==Statecraft==

Graham characterizes Shen as a theoretician of centralized power.<ref>Graham, A. C. 1989/2015. p301. Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China. Open Court. ISBN 9780812699425 – via Google Books.</ref> He espouses an impersonal administration in much the same sense as [[Shen Buhai]], and in contrast with [[Shang Yang]] emphasizes the use of talent<ref>{{Cite book |last=Major |first=John S. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh8xDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT207 |title=Ancient China: A History |last2=Cook |first2=Constance A. |date=2016-09-22 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-50365-1 |language=en}}</ref> and the promotion of ministers, saying that order and chaos are "not the product of one man's efforts." He also argued for [[Wu wei]], or the non action of the ruler, along the same lines as Shen Buhai, saying
{{blockquote| text=The Dao of ruler and ministers is that the ministers labour themselves with tasks while the prince has no task; the prince is relaxed and happy while the ministers bear responsibility for tasks. The ministers use all their intelligence and strength to perform his job satisfactorily, in which the ruler takes no part, but merely waits for the job to be finished. As a result, every task is taken care of. The correct way of government is thus.<ref>L.K. Chen and H.C.W Sung 2015 p.251 Dao Companion to Daoist Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=L24aBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA251</ref><ref>Emerson. Shen Dao: Text and Translation</ref>}}

However he challenges the Confucian and Mohist esteem and appointment of worthies as a basis of order, pointing out that talented ministers existed in every age. Taking it upon himself to attempt a new, analytical solution, Shen advocated fairness as a new virtue.  Scholar Sugamoto Hirotsugu attributes the concept of Fen, or social resources, later used by the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' and ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'', to Shen, given a "dimensional" difference through Fa (measurement, standards, protocol, administrative method), social relationships ("yin") and division. Shen Dao eschews appointment by interview in favour of a mechanical distribution ("the basis of fairness") with the invariable Fa apportioning every person according to their achievement.<ref>John Knoblock 1990. p. 172. Xunzi: Books 7–16. https://books.google.com/books?id=DNqmAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA172

{{blockquote | If one rabbit runs through a town street, and a hundred chase it, it is because its distribution has not been determined... If the distribution has already been determined, even the basest people will not fight for it. The way to control All-under-Heaven and the country lies solely in determining distribution.}}

The greatest function of ''Fa'' ("the principle of objective judgement") is the prevention of selfish deeds and argument. However, doubting its long-term viability Shen did not exclude moral values and accepted (qualified) Confucian [[Li (Confucian)|Li]]'s supplementation of ''Fa'' and social relationships, though he frames Li in terms of (impersonal) rules.<ref>Masayuki Sato 2003. p. 134–135.

{{blockquote | "The state has the li of high and low rank, but not a li of men of worth and those without talent. There is a li of age an youth, but not of age and cowardice. There is a li of near and distant relatives, but no li of love and hate."}}

For this reason he is said to "laugh at men of worth" and "reject sages", his order relying not on them but on the ''Fa''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schwartz |first=Benjamin Isadore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kA0c1hl3CXUC&pg=PA247 |title=The World of Thought in Ancient China |date=2009-06-30 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-04331-2 |language=en}}</ref>

Linking ''Fa'' to the notion of impartial objectivity associated with universal interest, and reframing the language of the old ritual order to fit a universal, imperial and highly bureaucratized state,<ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8">Erica Brindley, The Polarization of the Concepts Si (Private Interest) and Gong (Public Interest) in Early Chinese Thought. pp. 6, 8, 12–13, 16, 19, 21–22, 24, 27</ref> Shen cautions the ruler against relying on his own personal judgment,<ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.202">Shen Dao's Own Voice, 2011. p.202. Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011</ref> contrasting personal opinions with the merit of the objective standard, or fa, as preventing personal judgements or opinions from being exercised. Personal opinions destroy ''Fa'', and Shen Dao's ruler therefore "does not show favoritism toward a single person."<ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"/>

{{Blockquote | When an enlightened ruler establishes [gong] ("duke" or "public interest"), [private] desires do not oppose the correct timing [of things], favoritism does not violate the law, nobility does not trump the rules, salary does not exceed [that which is due] one's position, a [single] officer does not occupy multiple offices, and a [single] craftsman does not take up multiple lines of work&nbsp;... [Such a ruler] neither overworked his heart-mind with knowledge nor exhausted himself with self-interest (si), but, rather, depended on laws and methods for settling matters of order and disorder, rewards and punishments for deciding on matters of right and wrong, and weights and balances for resolving issues of heavy or light&nbsp;...<ref name="Erica Brindley p.6, 8"/>

<p>It is said: "When the great lord relies on fa and does not act personally, affairs are judged in accordance with (objective) method (fa)." The benefit of fa is that each person meets his reward or punishment according to his due, and there are no further expectations of the lord. Thus resentment does not arise and superiors and inferiors are in harmony. If the lord of men abandons method (Fa) and governs with his own person, then penalties and rewards, seizures and grants, will all emerge from the lord's mind. If this is the case, then those who receive rewards, even if these are commensurate, will ceaselessly expect more; those who receive punishment, even if these are commensurate, will endlessly expect more lenient treatment... people will be rewarded differently for the same merit and punished differently for the same fault. Resentment arises from this.<ref

==Doctrine of position (''shi'')==
[[File:Half Portraits of the Great Sage and Virtuous Men of Old - Meng Ke (孟軻).jpg|alt=|thumb|The people of Qi have a saying – "A man may have wisdom and discernment, but that is not like embracing the favourable opportunity. A man may have instruments of husbandry, but that is not like waiting for the farming seasons." [[Mencius]]
{{paragraph break}}
A floating seed of the p'eng plant, meeting a whirlwind, may be carried a thousand li, because it rides on the power (''shi'') of the wind. If, in measuring an abyss, you know that it is a thousand fathoms deep, it is owing to the figures which you find by dropping a string. By depending on the power (''shi'') of a thing, you will reach a point, however, distant it may be, and by keeping the proper figures, you will find out the depth, however deep it may be.  The [[Book of Lord Shang]]]]

Shen Dao, as the Han Feizi's figure for ''shi'', was a much later figure than Shang Yang and Shen Buhai. Used in many areas of Chinese thought however, ''shi'' probably originated in the military field.<ref>John Emerson 2012. p. 11. A Study of Shen Dao.</ref> Diplomats relied on concepts of situational advantage and opportunity, as well as secrecy (''shu'') long before the ascendency of such concepts as sovereignty or law, and were used by kings wishing to free themselves from the aristocrats.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gernet |first=Jacques |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&pg=PA92 |title=A History of Chinese Civilization |date=1996-05-31 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-49781-7 |language=en}}</ref> Sun Tzu would go on to incorporate Taoist philosophy of inaction and impartiality, as well as punishment and rewards as systematic measures of organization, recalling Han Fei's concepts of power (''shi'') and tactics (''shu'').<ref>Chen, Chao Chuan an Yueh-Ting Lee 2008 p.12. Leadership and Management in China</ref>

On the ''shi'' of ''[[The Art of War]]'', relatable to Shen Dao's, [[Henry Kissinger]] says: "Chinese statesmanship exhibits a tendency to view the entire strategic landscape as part of a single whole... Strategy and statecraft become means of 'combative coexistence' with opponents. The goal is to maneuver them into weakness while building up one's own ''shi'', or strategic position." Kissinger considers the "maneuvering" approach an ideal, but one that ran in contrast to the conflicts of the Qin dynasty.<ref>Henry Kissinger 2012 p.31. On China</ref>

The older works of [[Jacques Gernet]] and [[A.C. Graham]] in particular took the ''Legalists'' as understanding that the power of the state resides in social and political institutions, innovative in their aim to subject the state to them.<ref>Jacques Gernet 1982 p.90.

For Shen Dao, "Power" (Shih) refers to the ability to compel compliance requiring no support from its subjects, though it does not preclude this.<ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.203-205"/> (Shih's) merit is that it prevents people from fighting each other; political authority is justified and essential on this basis.<ref>Shen Dao's Own Voice, 2011. p.200,202. Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011</ref> Shen Dao says: "When All under Heaven lacks the single esteemed [person], then there is no way to carry out the principles [of orderly government, li 理]....

Talent cannot be displayed without power.<ref name="Chen p.113">Chen, Chao Chuan an Yueh-Ting Lee 2008 p.113.

But when the clouds disperse and the mists clear up, the dragon and the serpent become the same as the earthworm and the large winged black ant because they have lost what they ride."<ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.203-205"/> Leadership is not a function of ability or merit, but is given by some a process, such as giving a leader to a group.<ref>John Emerson 2012. p. 11.

Usually disregarded by the other figures, Shen Dao considers moral capability useful in terms of authority. If the ruler is inferior but his command is practised, it is because he is able to get support from people.<ref name="Shen Dao's Own Voice 2011. p.203-205"/> But his ideas otherwise constitute a "direct challenge" to Confucian Virtue.<ref>B.W.
