'''Joseph Petzoldt''' (4 November 1862 – 1 August 1929) was a German [[Positivism|positivist]] philosopher and teacher. He is known as the founder of several societies aimed at advancing positivist philosophy in the scientific world, and was an early proponent of the [[theory of relativity]] which he interpreted on the basis of his philosophy of "relativistic positivism".

==Life==

He studied natural sciences in the 1880s. In 1890 he obtained his [[doctorate]] in [[Göttingen]] on the [[Occam's razor|economy principle]] with the paper ''Maxima, Minima und Ökonomie''. In 1891 he became senior teacher in at the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Spandau (locality)|Spandau]]. In 1904 he obtained the [[habilitation]] in philosophy with the second volume of his work ''Einführung in die Philosophie der Reinen Erfahrung'', and taught as a [[Privatdozent]] at the TH Charlottenburg (today [[TU Berlin]]). In 1922 he became [[professor extraordinarius]] of philosophy at the TH Charlottenburg.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=[[Walter Dubislav]]|title=Joseph Petzoldt in memoriam: Vortrag, gehalten am 15.

He emphasized the relative nature of all phenomena from the perspective of observers in line with [[Protagoras]] and the rejection of the concept of substance in line with [[George Berkeley]], thereby eliminating the difference between "appearance" and "reality", and defined the "law of univocalness"<ref group=P name=ges /> according to which all observers must achieve a univocally determined description of processes. [[Vladimir Lenin]] in his work ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]]'' (1909) criticized the views of Petzoldt and other followers of Mach as [[solipsism]]. Petzoldt was founder and first chairman of the "society for positivist philosophy" (1912–1921) which was supported<ref>Proclamation signed by Petzoldt, Einstein and others: ''[https://archive.org/details/naturwissenschaf27deut/page/443/mode/1up Aufruf für die Bildung einer Gesellschaft für positivistische Philosophie]'', 1912, Naturwissenschaftliche Wochenschrift, Vol. 11, pp. 443–444</ref> by [[Albert Einstein]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Felix Klein]], among others; and he was co-founder of the "[[Berlin circle|local Berlin group]]" of the "international society for empirical philosophy" (1927).

He emphasized the equivalence of all observer viewpoints, the relativity of lengths and times, and the principle of [[light speed]] constancy as the direct outcome of the [[Fizeau experiment]] and the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], even though he had reservations about the conclusion that there can be no higher speeds in nature than that of light. Petzoldt's paper of 1914 was received very favorably by Einstein, who publicly recommended it in a newspaper article<ref>{{Citation|author=Einstein, A.|date=26 April 1914|title=Vom Relativitäts-Prinzip (CPAE Vol. 6)|journal=Vossische Zeitung|volume=209|pages=33–34|url=https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol6-doc/31}}; See also: [https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol6-trans/15 English translation in "CPAE Vol. 6"]</ref> and also privately shared his broad consent by letter (even though Einstein had to correct Petzoldt's erroneous description of the [[twin paradox]]).<ref>Letter Einstein's to Petzoldt from 14.

Petzoldt continued to defend his interpretation in the 1920s, believing that Einstein's new [[general theory of relativity]] was consistent with Machian philosophy, particularly in regard to the role that [[Mach's principle]] and all "coincidences of impressions" play in that theory.<ref group=P>''[https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:101:1-201705143831 Die Stellung der Relativitätstheorie in der geistigen Entwicklung der Menschheit]'', Leipzig, Barth, 1921; 2. enlarged edition 1923.</ref><ref group=P name=pema>[{{Google books|id=nQFLAQAAMAAJ|page=490|plainurl=yes}} ''Das Verhältnis der Machschen Gedankenwelt zur Relativitätstheorie''], 1921.

However, Petzoldt's radical relativistic-positivistic interpretation of relativity theory, along with insufficient technical understanding, led him to commit fundamental errors: In 1918–1919 he criticized representations of relativity theory that he believed to be reliant on "absolute" views and concepts,<ref group=P>''Verbietet die Relativitätstheorie Raum und Zeit als etwas wirkliches zu denken?'', 1918.

March 1919 in: The collected papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 9: [https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol9-doc/88 Document 9 in German].</ref> Petzoldt also misunderstood the [[Ehrenfest paradox]], which even an exchange of letters with Einstein in 1919 failed to clarify.<ref>Letter exchange between Einsteins and Petzoldt (1919) in: The collected papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 9: [https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol9-doc/189 Document 77 in German] with [https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol9-trans/87 English translation], [https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol9-doc/209 Document 93 in German] with [https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol9-trans/96 English translation], [https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol9-doc/214 Document 95 in German] with [https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol9-trans/99 English translation].</ref> Petzoldt also continued to be unconvinced about the twin paradox (which he had already criticized in 1914<ref name=pe14 group=P /> as "a return to absolutist thinking") as shown in a correspondence with [[Hans Reichenbach]] in 1922.<ref>{{Cite book|editor=Hentschel, K.|title=Die Korrespondenz Petzoldt-Reichenbach: Zur Entwicklung der wissenschaftlichen Philosophie in Berlin|location=Berlin|publisher=Sigma|year=1990|series=Berliner Beiträge zur Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften und der Technik|volume=12|isbn=9783928068031}}.</ref> Petzoldt's philosophy, along with his interpretation of the theory of relativity, was increasingly criticized and rejected by other philosophers such as Reichenbach, [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]] in the early 1920s, at which time also Einstein moved away from Machian philosophy towards a philosophical realism and apparently ceased his relations to Petzoldt after 1920.<ref name=hent /><ref name=krauss /><ref name=krauss2 />

The philosophical relationship between Petzoldt, Mach and Einstein also played a role in the controversy over a posthumously published preface to Mach's book ''Optics'', allegedly written by Ernst Mach in July 1913, in which he rejected the theory of relativity.

For example, there is a letter from Ernst Mach to Petzoldt dated 1 May 1914, which begins: "The accompanied letter from Einstein proves the penetration of positivist philosophy into physics; you can rejoice about it ... A year ago, philosophy as such was a mere stupidity...". From that Wolters concludes that in Mach's opinion, positivist philosophy entered modern physics through relativity theory, and since relativity is perhaps the most advanced physical theory that sets the standards for philosophy, it follows that positivist philosophy is no longer stupid unlike other philosophies. Thus, there is an emphatic statement of Mach in favor of relativity, written ''after'' the alleged foreword of July 1913. Wolters also alludes to the rivalry between Petzoldt and Ludwig Mach:<ref name=wolt /> In 1921, Petzoldt published an appendix to the 8th edition of Ernst Mach's book ''Mechanics'', in which Petzoldt described relativity as a consequence of Ernst Mach's philosophy, while Ludwig soon afterwards published the aforementioned (forged, according to Wolters) anti-relativistic foreword in ''Optics''. After Petzoldt's death, Ludwig published the 9th edition of ''Mechanics'' in 1933, in which Petzoldt's pro-relativistic appendix was removed and a new preface appeared, in which Ludwig once again inserted (forged, according to Wolters) anti-relativistic statements of Ernst Mach.
