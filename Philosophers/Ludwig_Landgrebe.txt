'''Ludwig Landgrebe''' (9 March 1902, [[Vienna]] &ndash; 14 August 1991, [[Cologne]]) was an Austrian [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] and Professor of philosophy. He is the grandfather of award-winning German actor Max Landgrebe.

In 1923 Landgrebe became assistant to [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859-1938). After the approval of his doctoral dissertation, Landgrebe transferred to [[Prague]] for his postdoctoral qualification under [[Oskar Kraus]].
