'''Christopher St John Sprigg''' (20 October 1907 &ndash; 12 February 1937), best known by his pseudonym '''Christopher Caudwell''', was an English [[Marxism|Marxist]] writer, literary critic, intellectual and activist.<ref name=commsdcu/>

==Life==
Christopher St John Sprigg was born into a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] family,<ref name="commsdcu" /> in [[Putney]], London, on 20 October 1907.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stevenson |first=Graham |date=2009-09-19 |title=Caudwell Christopher |url=https://grahamstevenson.me.uk/2008/09/19/christopher-caudwell/ |access-date=2024-03-11 |website=Graham Stevenson |language=en-GB}}</ref> He was educated at the [[Benedictine]] [[St Benedict's School, Ealing|Ealing Priory School]], but left school at the age of 15 and worked first as a cub reporter at the ''Yorkshire Observer'', where his father was literary editor, and then as editor of ''British Malaya''.<ref name=commsdcu/>

Two years later his founded an aeronautical publishing company with his brother. He also published on automobiles and he designed a infinitely variable gear. He continued scientific studies and published ''The Crisis of Physics'' in 1936.<ref name="Poems">{{Cite book |author=Caudwell |first=Christopher |title=Poems |publisher=John Lane, The Bodley Head |year=1939 |location=London |language=en}}</ref>

Caudwell became interested in [[Marxism]] in 1934 and began to study it with "extraordinary intensity". In the summer of 1935, he wrote his first Marxist book entitled ''Illusion and Reality: A Study of the Sources of Poetry'', which was published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]].<ref name=commsdcu/> Following the completion of his book he joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].<ref name="commsdcu">{{Cite web |last=Sheehan |first=Helena |date=6 July 2008 |title=Christopher Caudwell |url=http://www.comms.dcu.ie/sheehanh/caudwell.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706020738/http://www.comms.dcu.ie/sheehanh/caudwell.htm |archive-date=6 July 2008 |access-date=30 October 2021}}</ref>

==Death and legacy==
According to the socialist magazine ''[[Monthly Review]]'', Caudwell on 12 February 1937 "was killed by [[fascists]] in the valley of [[Jarama]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He died at a machine gun post, guarding the retreat of his comrades in the British Battalion of the [[International Brigade]]".<ref name=mr>{{Cite web|url=https://monthlyreview.org/press/75-years-after-the-death-of-christopher-caudwell/|title = Monthly Review &#124; 75 Years after the Death of Christopher Caudwell|website=Monthlyreview.org|date = 12 February 2012}}</ref>

The Marxist historian [[E. P. Thompson]] wrote of Caudwell, "It is not difficult to see Caudwell as a phenomenon – as an extraordinary shooting-star crossing England’s empirical night – as a premonitory sign of a more sophisticated Marxism whose true annunciation was delayed until the Sixties". The Marxist academic [[John Bellamy Foster]] similarly credited Caudwell with "breathtaking intellectual achievements in a brief period of time".<ref name=mr/>

In his 1942 introduction to ''The Fury of the Living'', a collection of poems by John Singer, [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] called Caudwell (along with [[John Cornford]], another young writer killed fighting in Spain), one of the "few inspiring exceptions" from the "leftist poets of the comfortable classes".<ref>MacDiarmid, H. (1970). Selected Essays of Hugh MacDiarmid, ed. Duncan Glen, Cape, 1969, p.90</ref>
