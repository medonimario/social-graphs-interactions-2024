'''Ralph Barton Perry''' (July 3, 1876 – January 22, 1957) was an American [[philosopher]]. He was a strident [[moral idealist]] who stated in 1909 that, to him, idealism meant "to interpret life consistently with [[ethical]], scientific, and [[metaphysical]] truth." Perry's viewpoints on religion stressed the notion that religious thinking possessed legitimacy should it exist within a framework accepting of [[human reason]] and [[social progress]].<ref name=perry>{{cite book|pages=[https://archive.org/details/moraleconomy00perrrich/page/248 248]–256|authorlink=Ralph Barton Perry|first=Ralph B.|last=Perry|title=The Moral Economy|url=https://archive.org/details/moraleconomy00perrrich|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Charles Scribner]]|date=1909}}</ref>

A pupil of [[William James]], whose ''[[Essays in Radical Empiricism]]'' he edited (1912), Perry became one of the leaders of the [[New realism (philosophy)|New Realism]] movement. Perry argued for a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] [[Value theory|theory of value]] and a [[New realism (philosophy)|New Realist]] theory of [[perception]] and knowledge. He wrote a celebrated biography of [[William James]], which won the 1936 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]], and proceeded to a revision of his critical approach to natural knowledge. An active member among a group of American New Realist philosophers, he elaborated around 1910 the program of new realism. However, he soon dissented from moral and spiritual [[ontology]], and turned to a [[philosophical pessimism|philosophy of disillusionment]]. Perry was an advocate of a [[Defensive democracy|militant democracy]]: in his words "total but not [[totalitarian]]". ''Puritanism and Democracy'' (1944) is a famous wartime attempt to reconcile two fundamental concepts in the origins of modern America. Between 1946 and 1948, he delivered in [[Glasgow]] his [[Gifford Lectures]], titled ''Realms of Value''.

He married Rachel Berenson on August 15, 1905, and they lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].<ref name=Anniversary/> Their son was Edward Barton Perry born at their home 5 Avon Street in Cambridge, September 27, 1906. In 1932, Edward married Harriet Armington Seelye (born [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], May 28, 1909), daughter of physician and surgeon Dr. Walker Clarke Seelye of Worcester and Annie Ide Barrows Seelye, formerly of [[Providence, Rhode Island]].

In 1919, he gave the commencement address for the first graduating class of [[Connecticut College]], which had opened its doors in 1915.

Perry died at his home in Cambridge on January 22, 1957, and was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/123888019/dr-ralph-barton-perry-winner-of/ |title=Dr. Ralph Barton Perry, Winner of Pulitzer Prize |newspaper=[[The Washington Star|The Evening Star]] |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |agency=AP |page=26 |date=1957-01-23 |access-date=2023-05-01 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>
