'''Joseph Albo''' ({{langx|he|יוסף אלבו}}; c. 1380–1444) was a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[rabbi]] who lived in [[Spain]] during the fifteenth century, known chiefly as the author of ''[[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]]'' ("Book of Principles"), the classic work on the [[Jewish principles of faith|fundamentals of Judaism]].

==Biography==
Albo's birthplace is generally assumed to be [[Monreal del Campo]], a town in [[Aragon]].  This is based on [[Astruc ha-Levi]]'s report of the [[Disputation of Tortosa|religious debate held at Tortosa]] in 1413-14, which mentions Albo as one of the Jewish participants and notes he was the delegate of the congregation of Monreal. However, the [[Latin]] account of this debate makes no reference to this locality.

[[Heinrich Graetz]] believes that Albo could not have been less than thirty years of age when he was sent to take part in the disputation, and he accordingly places the date of Albo's birth not later than 1380. His date of death is given variously as 1444 (most likely) or 1430. He is mentioned, however, as preaching at [[Soria]] in 1433.

The use Albo makes of medical illustrations creates the presumption that he was adept in medical science, which suggests that he may have practiced [[medicine]]. He was versed to some degree in the writings of [[Arab]] [[Aristotle|Aristotelians]]. His teacher was [[Hasdai Crescas]], author of ''[[Or Adonai]].'' Opinions vary on whether Crescas was still alive when ''[[Sefer HaIkkarim]]'' was published.

==''Sefer ha-Ikkarim''==
