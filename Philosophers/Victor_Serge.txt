'''Victor Serge''' ({{IPA|fr|viktɔʁ sɛʁʒ|lang}}; December 30, 1890 – November 17, 1947), born '''Victor Lvovich Kibalchich''' ({{langx|ru|Ви́ктор Льво́вич Киба́льчич}}), was a Russian writer, poet, [[Marxist]] revolutionary and historian. Originally an [[anarchist]], he joined the [[Bolsheviks]] five months after arriving in [[Petrograd]] in January 1919 and later worked for the [[Comintern]] as a journalist, editor and translator. He was critical of the [[Stalinist]] regime and remained a revolutionary Marxist until his death. He was a close supporter of the [[Left Opposition]] and associate of [[Leon Trotsky]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Weissman |first1=Susan |title=Victor Serge: A Political Biography |date=15 April 2014 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn=978-1-78168-957-8 |pages=1–30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cm3nDwAAQBAJ&q=victor+serge+left+opposition |language=en}}</ref> According to [[William Giraldi]], Serge's novels may be "read like an alloy of" [[George Orwell]] and [[Franz Kafka]]: "the uncommon political acuity of Orwell and the absurdist comedy of Kafka, a comedy with the damning squint of satire, except the satire is real."<ref>{{cite web | author-first=William | author-last=Giraldi | website=[[The Baffler]] | url=https://thebaffler.com/latest/victor-serge-unconquered | title=Victor Serge, the Unconquered | date=May 25, 2015 }}</ref> In his studies of Serge, [[Richard Greeman]] described him as a [[Literary modernism|Modernist]] writer influenced by [[James Joyce]], [[Andrei Bely]] and Freud; Greeman also believed that Serge, although writing in French, continued the experiments of such Russian Soviet writers as [[Isaac Babel]], [[Osip Mandelstam]] and [[Boris Pilnyak]] and poets [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and [[Sergei Yesenin]].<ref>{{cite journal |id={{Project MUSE|427121}} |last1=Greeman |first1=Richard |title=Victor Serge's The Case of Comrade Tulayev |journal=Minnesota Review |date=1980 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=61–79 }}</ref> He is remembered as the author of novels and other prose works, memoirs (e.g. ''[[Memoirs of a Revolutionary]]'') and poetry. Among his novels chronicling the lives of Soviet people and revolutionaries and of the first half of the 20th century, the best-known is ''The Case of Comrade Tulayev'' ({{langx|fr|L'affaire Toulaev}}). [[Nicholas Lezard]] calls the novel " of the great 20th-century Russian novels" that follows the traditions of "[[Nikolai Gogol|Gogolian]] absurdity".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview25 | title=Run over by history | newspaper=The Guardian | date=September 18, 2004 | last1=Lezard | first1=Nicholas }}</ref>

==Early life==
Serge was born in Belgium to Russian revolutionaries in exile. He had little formal schooling and left home in his teens. He lived in a French mining village, worked as a typesetter, and went to Paris. While in Paris he became an anarchist and editor of one of the movement's newspapers.<ref name=Hochschild>{{cite book|first=Adam|last=Hochschild |title=Finding the Trapdoor: Essays, Portraits, Travels|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=1997|page=65-87|chapter="Two Russians,"}} Excerpted in NYRB edition of Memoirs of a Revolutionary</ref>

During that time he was caught up in the trial of the [[Bonnot Gang]] with his then-wife [[Rirette Maîtrejean]] and others. Some of the accused were executed, the women were acquitted and Serge was sentenced to five years imprisonment for refusing to testify. He was 22 years old at the time of his sentencing and was released in 1917.<ref name=Bonnot>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Parry|title=The Bonnot Gang|publisher=Rebel Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0-946061-04-4}}</ref><ref name=Hochschild />

In 1919 he arrived in revolutionary Russia during the civil war between the Red (revolutionary) and White (counter-revolutionary) armies. While concerned that the Bolsheviks were repressing opposition to their left, he later wrote, "Even if there was only one chance in a hundred for the regeneration of the revolution and its workers' democracy, that chance had to be taken".<ref name=Hochschild />
