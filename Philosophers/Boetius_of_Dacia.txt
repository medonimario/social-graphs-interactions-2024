'''Boetius de Dacia''', [[Dominican Order|OP]] (also spelled '''Boethius de Dacia''') was a 13th-century [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]].

==Name==
The rendering of his name ''Danske Bo'' ("[[Bo (given name)|Bo]] the Dane") into Medieval Latin as ''Boetius de Dacia'' stems from the fact that the toponym ''[[Denmark|Dania]]'', meaning Denmark, was occasionally confused with ''[[Dacia (disambiguation)|Dacia]]'' during the Middle Ages.

==Life and accomplishments==
Boetius was born in the first half of the 13th century.  Not much is known of his early life. The attempt to connect him to known persons from Denmark or [[Sweden]] has been unsuccessful.<ref>Boethius de Dacia, ''Verdens evighed'', Det lille forlag, 2001, p. 8 (in Danish)</ref>{{primary source inline|date=July 2017}} All that is known is that he went to France to teach philosophy at the [[University of Paris]]. At the university, he associated with [[Siger of Brabant]]. He continued to teach for some time as arts masters rather than quickly moving on to study in the theology faculty or finding non-academic employment. He shared this unusual career path with Siger and others like [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Jean Buridan]]. He was [[Condemnations (University of Paris)|condemned]] by [[Stephen Tempier]] in 1277 for being a leading member of the [[Averroism|Averroist movement]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maurer|first=Armand|date=1955-01-01|title=Boetius of Dacia and the Double Truth|url=http://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.MS.2.306768|journal=Mediaeval Studies|volume=17|pages=233–239|doi=10.1484/J.MS.2.306768|issn=0076-5872}}</ref> Boetius fled [[Paris]] with Siger and appealed to [[Pope Nicholas III]]. He was detained at the pontifical [[curia]] at [[Orvieto]]. He went on to join the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s in Denmark.

Boetius was a follower of [[Aristotle]] and [[Averroes]] and a leading figure in the modists dogma. He wrote on [[logic]], [[natural philosophy]], [[metaphysics]], and [[ethics]], though some of his works have not survived. Some of his writings include; ''[[Modi Significandi]], Super librum Perihermenias,'' and ''Quaestiones super librum De animalibus,'' where he comments on these topics at length''.''<ref>{{Citation |last=Ebbesen |first=Sten |title=Boethius of Dacia |date=2020 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2020/entries/boethius-dacia/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |access-date=2023-09-18 |edition=Fall 2020 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref> His central position was that philosophy had to follow where the arguments led, regardless of their conflict with religious faith. For him, philosophy was the supreme human activity, and in this world only philosophers attained wisdom. In his book ''On the Highest Good, or On the Life of the Philosopher'' he offers a fervently [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aristotelianism Aristotelian] description of man's [[highest good]] as the rational contemplation of truth and virtue. Among the controversial conclusions that he reached are the impossibility of [[creatio ex nihilo|creation ''ex nihilo'']], the [[eternity of the world]] and of the human race, and that there could be no [[resurrection of the dead]].

Despite his radical views, Boetius remained a [[Christianity|Christian]]; he attempted to reconcile his religious beliefs with his philosophical positions by assigning the investigation of the world and of [[human nature]] to philosophy, while to religion he assigned supernatural [[revelation]] and divine [[miracle]]s. He was condemned for holding the doctrine of "[[double truth]]", though he was careful to avoid calling philosophical conclusions that ran contrary to religion true ''simpliciter'': In each branch of knowledge, one must be careful to qualify one's conclusions.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lindberg |first=David Charles |title=The beginnings of western science: the European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious and institutional context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450 |date=1992 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-48231-6 |location=Chicago |pages=235}}</ref> The conclusions that the philosopher reaches are true "according to natural causes and principles" (''De Aeternitate Mundi'', p.&nbsp;351).{{primary source inline|date=July 2017}}

Much like his early life, researchers have not been able to find exactly when Boetius died or what he did after 1277. "The Stams Catalogue" (14th Century) is a collection of literature from Dominican writers that includes Boethius, so there is some evidence suggesting he became a friar after his career in liberal arts.<ref>{{Citation |last=Ebbesen |first=Sten |title=Boethius of Dacia |date=2020 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2020/entries/boethius-dacia/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |access-date=2023-09-18 |edition=Fall 2020 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref>
