'''Leon Chwistek''' ([[Kraków]], [[Austria-Hungary]], 13 June 1884 – [[Barvikha]] near [[Moscow]], [[Russian SFSR|Russia]], 20 August 1944) was a Polish [[logician]], [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]], [[avant-garde]] [[Painting|painter]], theoretician of modern art and [[literary critic]].

==Career and philosophy==
In 1919 he was one of the founders of the [[Polish Mathematical Society]]. From 1922, he lectured in mathematics for natural scientists at the [[Jagiellonian University]], where he obtained his habilitation in 1928 in [[mathematical logic]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://culture.pl/pl/tworca/leon-chwistek |language=pl |title=Leon Chwistek |website=culture.pl |access-date=11 April 2024}}</ref>

Starting in 1929, Chwistek was a Professor of Logic at the [[University of Lwów]] in a position for which [[Alfred Tarski]] had also applied. His interests in the 1930s were in a general system of [[philosophy of science]], which was published in a book translated in English 1948 as ''The Limits of Science''.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2401-5_15 | title=Leon Chwistek's Theory of Constructive Types | year=2009 | journal=The Golden Age of Polish Philosophy | pages=203–219 | last1 = Linsky | first1 = Bernard| isbn=978-90-481-2400-8 }}</ref>

In the 1920s–30s, many [[Europe]]an philosophers attempted to reform traditional philosophy by means of mathematical logic. Leon Chwistek did not believe that such reform could succeed. He thought that [[reality]] could not be described in one homogeneous system, based on the principles of [[formal logic]], because there was not one reality but many.

After the outbreak of [[World War II]] and the occupation of [[Lviv|Lwów]] (renamed to [[Lviv]]) by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], he remained at the university. He also started cooperation with ''[[Czerwony Sztandar (Lviv newspaper)|Czerwony Sztandar]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bohdan Urbankowski, The Red Mass, or the Smile of Stalin, vol. 1, Warsaw 1998, p. 123}}</ref> In September 1940, he joined the Union of [[Writers' Union of Ukraine|Soviet Writers of Ukraine]]. In June 1941, just before the entry of the German troops, he evacuated from [[Lviv]] together with the Soviet troops deep into Russia. From 1941 to 1943, he lived in [[Tbilisi]], where he taught mathematical analysis, and from 1943 in Moscow. He was active in the [[Union of Polish Patriots]] in the USSR.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://culture.pl/pl/tworca/leon-chwistek |language=pl |title=Leon Chwistek |website=culture.pl |access-date=11 April 2024}}</ref>

Chwistek argued against the [[axiomatic method]] by demonstrating that the extant axiomatic systems are inconsistent.<ref>First chapter of Chwistek, ''The Limits of Science''</ref>

==Artist==
Chwistek developed his theory of the multiplicity of realities first with regard to the [[art]]s. He distinguished four basic types of realities, then matched them with four basic types of painting.

The four types of realities were:
:1. popular reality (common-sense realism)
:2. physical reality (constructed by physics)
:3. phenomenal reality (sensory impressions)
:4. visionary/intuitive reality (dreams, hallucinations, subconscious states).

The types of painting corresponding to the above were:
:1. [[Primitivism]]
:2. [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]
:3. [[Impressionism]]
:4. [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]]
Chwistek never intended his views to constitute a new [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory. He was a defender of "common sense" against metaphysics and irrational feeling. His theory of plural reality was merely an attempt to specify the various ways in which the term, “real,” is used.
 
Chwistek's fellow artist and closest friend, [[Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz]], harshly criticized his  philosophical views.  Witkiewicz's own philosophy was based on a [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]ic character to the individual's existence, embracing a multiplicity of existences, with the world being made up of a multiplicity of Particular Existences. In his 1919 painting titled ''Fencing'' inspirations from avant-garde trends prior to [[World War I]] such as [[cubism]], Italian [[futurism]], and [[Robert Delaunay]]’s simultanism can be observed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://culture.pl/en/work/fencing-leon-chwistek |title=Fencing – Leon Chwistek |website=culture.pl |author=Przemysław Strożek |access-date=11 April 2024}}</ref>
