'''Harald Høffding''' (11 March 1843 – 2 July 1931) was a Danish [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]].

==Life==
Born Høffding was born in Copenhagen, the son of businessman Niels Frederik Høffding and Martha Høffding (née Jhellerup). The family lived at the [[Alexandrahus|corner of Gammeltorv]] and [[Nørregade]]. Høffding became a schoolmaster, and ultimately in 1883 a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He was strongly influenced by [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in his early development, but later became a [[positivism|positivist]], retaining and combining with it the spirit and method of practical [[psychology]] and the critical school.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Höffding, Harald|volume=13|page=561}}</ref>  The  physicist [[Niels Bohr]] studied philosophy from and became a friend of Høffding. The philosopher and author [[Ágúst H. Bjarnason]] was a student of Høffding.

Høffding's great-nephew was the statistician [[Wassily Hoeffding]].

Høffding died in Copenhagen.

==Work==

His best-known work is perhaps his ''Den nyere Filosofis Historie'' (1894), translated into English from the German edition (1895) by B.E. Meyer as ''History of Modern Philosophy'' (2 vols., 1900), a work intended by him to supplement and to correct that of Hans Brøchner to whom it is dedicated. His ''Psychology, the Problems of Philosophy'' (1905) and ''Philosophy of Religion'' (1906) also have appeared in English.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Among Høffding's other writings, most of which have been translated into German, are ''Den engelske Filosofi i vor Tid'' (1874); ''Etik'' (1876); ''Psychologi i Omrids paa Grundlag af Erfaring'' (ed. 1892); ''Psykologiske Undersøgelser'' (1889); ''[[Charles Darwin]]'' (1889); ''Kontinuiteten i Kants filosofiske Udviklingsgang'' (1893); ''[[Søren Kierkegaard as Philosopher|Sören Kierkegaard als Philosoph]]'' (1896); ''Det psykologiske Grundlag for logiske Domme'' (1899); ''Rousseau und seine Philosophie'' (1901); ''Mindre Arbejder'' (1899).<ref name="EB1911"/>
