==Biography==
Nasir al-Din Tusi was born in the city of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]] in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (northeastern [[Iran]]) in the year 1201 and began his studies at an early age. In [[Hamadan]] and Tus, he studied the [[Quran]], [[Hadith]], [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]], logic, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, and astronomy.<ref name="Dabashi">Dabashi, Hamid. "Khwajah Nasir al-Din Tusi: The philosopher/vizier and the intellectual climate of his times". Routledge History of World Philosophies. Vol I. History of Islamic Philosophy. Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Oliver Leaman (eds.) London: Routledge. 1996. p. 529</ref>

He was born into a [[Shia Islam|Shī‘ah]] family and lost his father at a young age. Fulfilling the wish of his father, the young Muhammad took learning and scholarship very seriously and traveled far and wide to attend the lectures of renowned scholars and acquired knowledge, an exercise highly encouraged in his Islamic faith. At a young age, he moved to [[Nishapur]] to study philosophy under Farid al-Din Damad and mathematics under [[Muhammad Hasib]].<ref name="HistMuslimPhil">Siddiqi, Bakhtyar Husain. "Nasir al-Din Tusi". A History of Islamic Philosophy. Vol 1. M. M. Sharif (ed.). Wiesbaden:: Otto Harrossowitz. 1963. p. 565</ref> He met also [[Attar of Nishapur]], the legendary [[Sufism|Sufi master]] who was later killed by  the [[Mongols]], and he attended the lectures of [[Qutb al-Din al-Misri]] - a student of [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi|Al-Razi]].

Nasir-al-Din Tusi writes in his work, ''Desideratum of the Faithful (Maṭlūb al-muʾminīn)'',“To become people of spiritual reality, it is incumbent to fulfill the symbolic elucidation (''[[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|ta'wīl]]'') of the seven pillars of the religious law (''[[Sharia|sharīʿat]]'')”. He also explains that fulfilling the religious law is much easier than fulfilling its spiritual interpretation.<ref name="Virani 193–227">{{Cite journal|last=Virani|first=Shafique N.|date=2018-04-16|title=Alamūt, Ismailism and Khwāja Qāsim Tushtarī's Recognizing God|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/24682470-12340021|journal=Shii Studies Review|volume=2|issue=1–2|pages=193–227|doi=10.1163/24682470-12340021|issn=2468-2462}}</ref>

He explains in his book ''Aghaz u anjam'' that the sacred accounts of history that we perceive within the bounds of space and time symbolize events that have no such restrictions. They are only expressed in this way so that humans are able to comprehend them.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Virani|first=Shafique|title=Hierohistory in Qāḍī l-Nuʿmān's Foundation of Symbolic Interpretation (Asās al-Taʾwīl): The Birth of Jesus|url=https://www.academia.edu/41992496|journal=Studies in Islamic Historiography|year=2019 |pages=147–169 |language=en|doi=10.1163/9789004415294_007|isbn=978-90-04-41529-4 |s2cid=214047322 }}</ref>

In [[Mosul]], al-Tusi studied mathematics and astronomy with [[Kamal al-Din Yunus]] (d. [[Hijri year|AH]] 639 / AD 1242), a pupil of [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]].<ref name=MacT>{{Cite web|url=https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Tusi_Sharaf/|title=Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi - Biography|website=Maths History}}</ref> Later on he corresponded with [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi]], the son-in-law of [[Ibn Arabi]], and it seems that mysticism, as propagated by Sufi masters of his time, was not appealing to him. Once the occasion was suitable, he composed his own manual of philosophical Sufism in the form of a small booklet entitled ''Awsaf al-Ashraf,'' or "The Attributes of the Illustrious".

As the armies of [[Genghis Khan]] swept his homeland, he was employed by the [[Nizari Ismaili state]] and, while moving from stronghold to stronghold, made his most important contributions in science,<ref>Peter Willey, ''The Eagle's Nest: Ismaili Castles in Iran and Syria'', (I.B. Tauris, 2005), 172.</ref> first in those of the [[Quhistan]] region under [[Muhtasham Nasir al-Din Abd al-Rahim ibn Abi Mansur]] (where he wrote the ''[[Nasirean Ethics]]''). He was later sent to the major castles of [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] and [[Maymun-Diz]] to continue his career under Nizari Imam [[Muhammad III of Alamut|Ala al-Din Muhammad]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Farhad Daftari |title=اسماعیلیان سده‌های میانه در سرزمین‌های ایران {{!}} The Institute of Ismaili Studies |url=http://akdn2stg.prod.acquia-sites.com/sites/default/files/The%20mediaeval%20Ismailis%20of%20the%20Iranian%20Lands%20-%20Farsi-103105894.pdf |website=www.iis.ac.uk |access-date=31 March 2020 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Lagerlund |first1=Henrik |title=Encyclopedia of Medieval Philosophy: Philosophy Between 500 and 1500 |date=2010 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-9728-7 |page=825 |language=en}}</ref> He was captured after the fall of Maymun-Diz to the Mongol forces under [[Hulagu Khan]].<ref>[[Michael Axworthy]], ''A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind'', (Basic Books, 2008), 104.</ref>

Nasir al-Din Tusi’s autobiography, ''The Voyage (Sayr wa-Suluk)'' explains that a literary devastation such as the devastation of the [[Nizari Ismaili state|Alamūt]] libraries in 1256 would not waver the spirit of the [[Nizari Isma'ilism|Nizari Ismaili]] community because they give more importance to the “living book” (the [[Imamate in Ismaili doctrine|Imam of the Time]]) rather than the “[[Quran|written word]]”. Their hearts are attached to the Commander of the Believers (''[[Amir al-Mu'minin|amir al-mu'minin]]''), not just the “command” itself. There is always a present living Imam in world, and following him, a believer will never go astray.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=Virani|first=Shafique N.|title=Salvation and Imamate|date=2007-04-01|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195311730.003.0009|work=The Ismailis in the Middle Ages|pages=165–182|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195311730.003.0009|isbn=978-0-19-531173-0|access-date=2020-11-17}}</ref>

=== Role during the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Mongol invasion of Baghdad]] ===
In 1256 al-Tusi was in the castle of Alamut when it was attacked by the forces of the Mongol leader [[Hulagu Khan|Hulegu]], a grandson of Genghis Khan. Some sources claim that al-Tusi betrayed the defences of Alamut to the invading Mongols. After his forces destroyed Alamut, Hulegu, who was himself interested in the natural sciences, treated al-Tusi with great respect, appointing him as scientific adviser and a permanent member of his inner council.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=VAKILY |first=ABDOLLAH |date=2001 |title=Khvājah Naṣīr al-Dīn Ṭūsī's "Āghāz va Anjām": An Introduction and Abridged Translation |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20837076 |journal=Islamic Studies |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=89–103 |jstor=20837076 |issn=0578-8072}}</ref> To great controversy, it is widely assumed Tusi was with the Mongol forces under Hulegu when they attacked and massacred the inhabitants of Baghdad in 1258<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |title=Nasir al-Din al-Tusi - Biography |url=https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Tusi_Nasir/ |access-date=2022-07-04 |website=Maths History |language=en}}</ref> and he played an essential role in ending of the [[Quraysh]] [[Caliphate|Empire]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Khandmir |first1=Ghiyasoddin ibn Homamoddin |title=The history of Habib al Sir |date=2001 |publisher=Khayyaam |location=Tehran |isbn=964-6101-53-4 |page=338 |url=https://noorlib.ir/book/view/11207}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Khansari |first1=Mohammad Bagher |title=Rozat al Jannaat |trans-title=Gardens of Paradise |date=1970–1971 |publisher=Esma'ilian |location=Ghom |page=315 |url=https://lib.eshia.ir/10983 |language=ar}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Modarresi |first1=Mohammad |title=The biography and philosophical ideas of Khawja Nasir al-Din Tus |date=2001 |publisher=Amir Kabir |location=Tehran |isbn=978-964-00-0677-1 |page=52}}</ref>

Tusi has about 150 works, of which 25 are in [[Persian language|Persian]] and the remaining are in [[Arabic language|Arabic]],<ref name="H. Daiber, F.J. Ragep 2007"/> and there is one treatise in Persian, Arabic and [[Oghuz languages|Turkish]].<ref>Seyyed Hossein Nasr. The Islamic Intellectual Tradition in Persia. Curson Press, 1996. See p. 208: "Nearly 150 treatises and letters by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi are known, of which twenty-five are in Persian and the rest in Arabic. There is even a treatise on geomancy that Tusi wrote in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, demonstrating his mastery of all three languages. It is said that he also knew Greek. His writings concern nearly every branch of the Islamic sciences, from astronomy to  philosophy and from the occult sciences to theology."</ref>

During his stay in Nishapur, Tusi established a reputation as an exceptional scholar. Tusi’s prose writing, which numbers over 150 works, represent one of the largest collections by a single Islamic author. Writing in both [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], Nasir al-Din Tusi dealt with both religious ("Islamic") topics and non-religious or secular subjects ("the ancient sciences").<ref name="H.

===Astronomy===
{{further|Zij-i Ilkhani|Tusi-couple}}
[[File:Nasir al-Din al-Tusi at observatory.jpg|thumb|The Astronomical Observatory of Nasir al-[[Dīn]] Tusi.]]
Tusi convinced [[Hulegu Khan]] to construct an observatory for establishing accurate astronomical tables for better astrological predictions. Beginning in 1259, the [[Maragheh observatory|Rasad Khaneh observatory]] was constructed in [[Azarbaijan]], south of the river [[Aras (river)|Aras]], and to the west of [[Maragheh]], the capital of the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanate Empire]].<ref name="Rossabi2014">{{cite book|author=Morris Rossabi|title=From Yuan to Modern China and Mongolia: The Writings of Morris Rossabi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXejBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA281|date=28 November 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-28529-3|pages=281–}}</ref>

Based on the observations in this for the time being most advanced observatory, Tusi made very accurate tables of [[Ephemeris|planetary movements]] as depicted in his book ''[[Zij-i ilkhani]]'' (''Ilkhanic Tables''). This book contains astronomical tables for calculating the positions of the planets and the names of the stars. His model for the planetary system is believed to be the most advanced of his time, and was used extensively until the development of the heliocentric model in the time of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. Between [[Ptolemy]] and [[Copernicus]], he is considered by many{{who|date=April 2014}} to be one of the most eminent astronomers of his time. His famous student [[Shams al-Din al-Bukhari]]<ref name="Shams"/> was the teacher of [[Byzantine]] scholar [[Gregory Chioniades]],<ref name="Chioniadis">{{MathGenealogy|id=201288}}</ref> who had in turn trained [[astronomer]] [[Manuel Bryennios]]<ref name="Bryennios">{{MathGenealogy|id=184632}}</ref> about 1300 in [[Constantinople]].

For his planetary models, he invented a geometrical technique called a [[Tusi-couple]], which generates linear motion from the sum of two circular motions. He used this technique to replace [[Ptolemy]]'s problematic [[equant]]<ref>Craig G. Fraser, '[https://books.google.com/books?id=3tJr_vl6rYsC&pg=PA39 The cosmos: a historical perspective]', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006 p.39</ref> for many planets, but was unable to find a solution to Mercury, which was used later by [[Ibn al-Shatir]] as well as [[Ali Qushji]].<ref>George Saliba, '[https://www.academia.edu/22220405/Al_Qushj%C4%ABs_Reform_of_the_Ptolemaic_Model_for_Mercury]', Arabic Sciences and Philosophy, v.3 1993, pp.161-203</ref>  The Tusi couple was later employed in [[Ibn al-Shatir]]'s [[geocentric model]] and [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]].<ref>George Saliba, 'Revisiting the Astronomical Contacts Between the World of Islam and Renaissance Europe: The Byzantine Connection', '[https://books.google.com/books?id=muGVUiKEYccC&pg=PA368 The occult sciences in Byzantium]', 2006, p.368</ref> He also calculated the value for the annual precession of the [[equinox]]es and contributed to the construction and usage of some astronomical instruments including the [[astrolabe]].

Ṭūsī criticized Ptolemy's use of observational evidence to show that the Earth was at rest, noting that such proofs were not decisive. Although it doesn't mean that he was a supporter of mobility of the earth, as he and his 16th-century commentator [[al-Birjandi|al-Bīrjandī]], maintained that the earth's immobility could be demonstrated, only by physical principles found in natural philosophy.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ragep | first = F.

About the real essence of the Milky Way, Ṭūsī in his ''Tadhkira'' writes:
"The Milky Way, i.e. the galaxy, is made up of a very large number of small, tightly-clustered stars, which, on account of their concentration and smallness, seem to be cloudy patches. because of this, it was likened to milk in color."

Three centuries later the proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when [[Galileo Galilei]] used a [[Optical telescope|telescope]] to study the Milky Way and discovered that it is really composed of a huge number of faint stars.<ref>{{cite web | author = O'Connor, J.

===Logic===
Nasir al-Din Tusi was a supporter of [[Avicennian logic]], and wrote the following commentary on [[Avicenna]]'s theory of absolute [[proposition]]s:

{{quote|"What spurred him to this was that in the [[assertoric]] [[syllogistic]] [[Aristotle]] and others sometimes used [[Contradiction|contradictories]] of absolute propositions on the assumption that they are absolute; and that was why so many decided that absolutes did contradict absolutes. When Avicenna had shown this to be wrong, he wanted to develop a method of construing those examples from Aristotle."<ref name=Stanford>{{cite web|author=Tony Street|title=Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 23, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-language|access-date=2008-12-05}}</ref>}}

===Mathematics===
[[File:Stamps of Azerbaijan, 2009-861.jpg|thumb|upright|A stamp issued in the republic of Azerbaijan in 2009 honoring Tusi]]
Al-Tusi was the first to write a work on trigonometry independently of astronomy.<ref name=britannica>{{cite encyclopedia|title=trigonometry|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/605281/trigonometry|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=2011-04-25}}</ref> Al-Tusi, in his ''Treatise on the Quadrilateral'', gave an extensive exposition of [[spherical trigonometry]], distinct from astronomy.<ref>* Katz, Victor J.

He was the first to list the six distinct cases of a right triangle in spherical trigonometry.<ref>http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Tusi_Nasir.html,"One{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} of al-Tusi's most important mathematical contributions was the creation of trigonometry as a mathematical discipline in its own right rather than as just a tool for astronomical applications.

This work is really the first in history on trigonometry as an independent branch of pure mathematics and the first in which all six cases for a right-angled spherical triangle are set forth"/</ref>

This followed earlier work by [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematicians]] such as [[Menelaus of Alexandria]], who wrote a book on spherical trigonometry called ''Sphaerica'', and the earlier Muslim mathematicians [[Abū al-Wafā' al-Būzjānī]] and [[Al-Jayyani]].

In his ''On the Sector Figure'', appears the famous [[law of sines|Sine Law]] for plane triangles.<ref name=Berggren-518>{{cite book | first=J. Lennart | last=Berggren | title=The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam: A Sourcebook | chapter=Mathematics in Medieval Islam | publisher=Princeton University Press | date=2007 |isbn=978-0-691-11485-9 | page=518}}</ref>

=== [[Color theory ]] ===
While Aristotle (d. 322 BCE) had suggested that all colors can be aligned on a single line from black to white, Ibn-Sina (d. 1037) described that there were three paths from black to white, one path via grey, a second path via red and the third path via green. Al-Tusi (ca. 1258) stated that there are no less than five of such paths, via lemon (yellow), blood (red), pistachio (green), indigo (blue) and grey. This text, which was copied in the Middle East numerous times until at least the nineteenth century as part of the textbook Revision of the Optics (Tanqih al-Manazir) by [[Kamāl_al-Dīn_al-Fārisī#Optics|Kamal al-Din al-Farisi]] (d. 1320), made [[color space]] effectively two-dimensional.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kirchner |first1=E. |title=Color theory and color order in medieval Islam: A review |journal=Color Research & Application |date=2013 |volume=40 |issue=1 |page=5-16 |doi=10.1002/col.21861}}</ref> 
Before Al-Tusi, Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253) had proposed an effectively three-dimensional model of color space.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Smithson |first1=H.E. |last2=Dinkova-Bruun |first2=G. |last3=Gasper |first3=G.E.M. |last4=Huxtable |first4=M. |last5=McLeish |first5=T.C.B. |last6=Panti |first6=C. |title=A three-dimensional color space from the 13th century |journal=J.

===Biology===
In his ''Akhlaq-i Nasiri'', Tusi wrote about several biological topics. He defended a version of Aristotle's ''[[scala naturae]]'', in which he placed man above animals, plants, minerals, and the elements. He described "grasses which grow without sowing or cultivation, by the mere mingling of elements,"<ref name="NEp44">Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;44.</ref> as closest to minerals. Among plants, he considered the [[date-palm]] as the most highly developed, since "it only lacks one thing further to reach (the stage of) an animal: to tear itself loose from the soil and to move away in the quest for nourishment."<ref name="NEp44" />

The lowest animals "are adjacent to the region of plants: such are those animals which propagate like grass, being incapable of mating [...], e.g. [[earthworm]]s, and certain [[insect]]s".<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> The animals "which reach the stage of perfection [...] are distinguished by fully developed weapons", such as antlers, horns, teeth, and claws. Tusi described these organs as adaptations to each species's lifestyle, in a way anticipating [[natural theology]]. He continued:

{{quote|"The noblest of the species is that one whose sagacity and perception is such that it accepts discipline and instruction: thus there accrues to it the perfection not originally created in it. Such are the schooled [[horse]] and the trained [[falcon]]. The greater this faculty grows in it, the more surpassing its rank, until a point is reached where the (mere) observation of action suffices as instruction: thus, when they see a thing, they perform the like of it by mimicry, without training [...]. This is the utmost of the animal degrees, and the first of the degrees of Man in contiguous therewith."<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45f.</ref>}}

Thus, in this paragraph, Tusi described different types of [[learning]], recognising [[observational learning]] as the most advanced form, and correctly attributing it to certain animals.

Tusi seems to have perceived man as belonging to the animals, since he stated that "the Animal Soul [comprising the faculties of perception and movement ...] is restricted to individuals of the animal species", and that, by possessing a "Human Soul, [...] mankind is distinguished and particularized among ''other'' animals."<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;42 (emphasis added).</ref>

Some scholars have interpreted Tusi's biological writings as suggesting that he adhered to some kind of [[evolution]]ary theory. However, Tusi did not state explicitly that he believed species to change over time.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

===Chemistry===
Tusi contributed to the field of chemistry, stating an early law of [[conservation of mass]]. Al-Tusi's theory of chemical transformation was based on the idea that substances could be transformed into other substances through chemical reactions, but that the total mass of the substances involved in the reaction would remain constant. This idea was a precursor to the law of conservation of mass, which states that the total mass of a closed system remains constant during a chemical reaction. Al-Tusi believed that chemical transformations were governed by natural laws and that they could be understood through observation, experimentation, and logical reasoning.<ref>Ahmad Y. al-Hassan, ''Conservation of Mass in Fourteenth Century Chemistry'', History of Science, vol. 17, pp. 65-80, 1979.</ref><ref>Abdelhamid I.

=== Philosophy ===
Tusi contributed many writings to the topic of philosophy. Amongst his philosophical work are his disagreements with fellow philosopher [[Avicenna]]. His most famous philosophical work is ''[[Nasirean Ethics|Akhlaq-i nasiri]]'' or ''[[Nasirean Ethics]]'' in English.<ref name="Freely 2011">{{Cite book|last=Freely|first=John|date=2011|title=Light from the East|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5040/9780755600007|doi=10.5040/9780755600007|isbn=978-0-7556-0000-7}}</ref> Within this work he discusses and compares Islamic teachings to the ethics of Aristotle and Plato.

=== Possible Influence on Nicolaus Copernicus ===
Some scholars believe that [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] may have been influenced by Middle Eastern astronomers due to uncanny similarities between his work and the uncited work of these Islamic scholars, including Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, [[Ibn al-Shatir]], [[Mu'ayyad al-Din al-Urdi|Muayyad al-Din al-Urdi]], and [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]].<ref name=":12"/><ref name=":22"/><ref name=":32"/><ref name=":62"/><ref name=":03"/><ref name=":72"/> al-Tusi specifically, the plagiarism in question comes from similarities in the [[Tusi couple]] and [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]]' geometric method of removing the [[Equant]] from mathematical astronomy.<ref name=":32" /><ref name=":03" /> Not only do both of the methods match geometrically, however, more importantly they both use the same exact lettering system for each [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]]; a detail that seems too preternatural to be happenstance.<ref name=":32" /><ref name=":03" /> Moreover, the fact that several other details of his model also mirror other Islamic scholars bolsters the notion that Copernicus' work may not have been only his own.<ref name=":03" />

There is no evidence that any of the direct work of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi ever made it to Copernicus, however there is evidence that the mathematics and theories did make the journey to Europe.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":22" /> There were Jewish scientists and pilgrims who would make the journey from the Middle East to Europe, bringing with them Middle Eastern scientific ideas to share with their Christian counterparts.<ref name=":22" /> While acknowledging that this is not direct evidence that Copernicus has access to al-Tusi's work, it does show that it was possible.<ref name=":22" />  There was just such a Jewish scholar by the name of  [[Abner of Burgos]] who wrote a book containing an incomplete version of the Tusi couple that he had learned second hand, which could have been found by Copernicus.<ref name=":12" /> It is important to note that his version had no proofs of the geometry either, so if Copernicus had obtained this book he would have had to complete both the proof and mechanism.<ref name=":12" /> Additionally, some scholars believe that, if not Jewish thinkers, it could have been transmission from the Islamic school in [[Maragheh]], home to Nasir al-Din al-Tusi's [[Maragheh observatory|observatory]] to Muslim Spain.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":22" /> From Spain, al-Tusi and other Islamic cosmological theories could spread through Europe.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":22" /> Spread of Islamic astronomy from Maragheh Observatory into Europe could have also been possible in the form of Greek translations from [[Gregory Choniades]].<ref name=":22" /> There is evidence as to the means of Copernicus acquiring the Tusi couple and suspicious similarities, not only in math but in visual details as well.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":22" /><ref name=":32" /><ref name=":62" /><ref name=":03" /><ref name=":72" />

Despite this circumstantial evidence, there is still no direct proof that Copernicus did plagiarize the work of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and if he did that he did so intentionally.<ref name=":32" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Veselovsky|first=I.
