==Biography==
Windelband was born the son of a Prussian official in [[Potsdam]]. He studied at [[University of Jena|Jena]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]].

==Philosophical work==
Windelband is now mainly remembered for the terms [[nomothetic and idiographic|''nomothetic'' and ''idiographic'']], which he introduced. These have currency in [[psychology]] and other areas, though not necessarily in line with his original meanings. Windelband was a [[Neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantian]] who argued against other contemporary neo-Kantians, maintaining that "to understand [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] rightly means to go beyond him". Against his [[positivist]] contemporaries, Windelband argued that philosophy should engage in humanistic dialogue with the natural sciences rather than uncritically appropriating its methodologies. His interests in [[psychology]] and cultural sciences represented an opposition to [[psychologism]] and [[historicism]] schools by a critical philosophic system.

Windelband relied in his effort to reach beyond Kant on such philosophers as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] and [[Hermann Lotze]]. Closely associated with Windelband was [[Heinrich Rickert]]. Windelband's disciples were not only noted philosophers, but [[sociologists]] like [[Max Weber]] and [[theologians]] like [[Ernst Troeltsch]] and [[Albert Schweitzer]].
