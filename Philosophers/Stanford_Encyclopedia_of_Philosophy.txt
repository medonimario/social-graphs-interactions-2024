The '''''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''''' ('''''SEP''''') is a freely available online [[philosophy]] resource published and maintained by [[Stanford University]], encompassing both an [[online encyclopedia]] of philosophy and [[scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]] original publication.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/480741/this-free-online-encyclopedia-has-achieved-what-wikipedia-can-only-dream-of/|title=This free online encyclopedia has achieved what Wikipedia can only dream of|last=Sonnad|first=Nikhil|website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=21 September 2015 |language=en|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Zalta|first=Edward|date=2006-09-01|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: A university/library partnership in support of scholarly communication and open access|journal=College & Research Libraries News|volume=67|issue=8|pages=502–504|doi=10.5860/crln.67.8.7670|issn=2150-6698|url=http://crln.acrl.org/index.php/crlnews/article/download/7670/7670|doi-access=free}}</ref> Each entry is written and maintained by an expert in the field, including [[professor]]s from many academic institutions worldwide.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Colin|last2=Jagodzinski|first2=Cecile|date=2013-11-04|title=From SEP to SEPIA: How and Why Indiana University is Helping the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|journal=Against the Grain|volume=18|issue=4|doi=10.7771/2380-176x.4919|issn=2380-176X|doi-access=free}}</ref> Authors contributing to the encyclopedia give Stanford University the permission to publish the articles, but retain the [[copyright]] to those articles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/info.html#c|title=''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Copyright Information|access-date=December 1, 2015}}</ref>

==Approach and history==
As of August 5, 2022, the ''SEP'' has 1,774 published entries. Apart from its online status, the encyclopedia uses the traditional academic approach of most encyclopedias and [[academic journal]]s to achieve quality by means of specialist authors selected by an editor or an editorial committee that is competent (although not necessarily considered specialists) in the field covered by the encyclopedia and [[peer review]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tananbaum|first=Greg|date=2006|title=I Hear the Train A Comin' -- Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|journal=Against the Grain|volume=18|issue=1|doi=10.7771/2380-176x.4863|issn=2380-176X|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The encyclopedia was created in 1995 by [[Edward N. Zalta]],<ref name=":2" /> with the explicit aim of providing a dynamic encyclopedia that is updated regularly, and so does not become dated in the manner of conventional print encyclopedias.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Colin|last2=Nodelman|first2=Uri|last3=Zalta|first3=Edward N.|date=2002|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: A Developed Dynamic Reference Work|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=33|issue=1&2|pages=210–228|doi=10.1111/1467-9973.00225|issn=0026-1068}}</ref> The charter for the encyclopedia allows for rival articles on a single topic to reflect reasoned disagreements among scholars. Initially, the ''SEP'' was developed with U.S. public funding from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[National Science Foundation]]. A long-term fundraising plan to preserve [[open access]] to the encyclopedia is supported by many university libraries and library consortia.  These institutions contribute under a plan devised by the ''SEP'' in collaboration with the [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]], the [[International Coalition of Library Consortia]], and the [[Southeastern Library Network]], with matching funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities.<ref name=":1" />
