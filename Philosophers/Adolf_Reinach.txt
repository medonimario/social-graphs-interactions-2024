'''Adolf Bernhard Philipp Reinach''' (23 December 1883 – 16 November 1917) was a German philosopher, phenomenologist from the [[Munich phenomenology]] school and law theorist.

==Life and work==
Adolf Reinach was born into a prominent Jewish family in [[Mainz]],<ref name=reinach>{{cite book|title=Speech Act and Sachverhalt: Reinach and the Foundations of Realist Phenomenology.

Adolf Reinach studied at the ''[[Rabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium|Ostergymnasium]]'' in Mainz (where he became at first interested in Plato) and later entered the [[University of Munich]] in 1901 where he studied mainly [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]] under [[Theodor Lipps]]. In the circle of Lipps' students he came in contact with [[Moritz Geiger]], [[Otto Selz]], [[Aloys Fischer]] and above all [[Johannes Daubert]]. From onward 1903/4 he was increasingly busy with the works of [[Edmund Husserl]], especially his ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'').

In 1904, Reinach obtained his doctorate in philosophy under Lipps with his work ''Über den Ursachenbegriff im geltenden Strafrecht'' (On the concept of cause in penal law). In 1905, he still intended to continue his studies in Munich (where in the meanwhile he had also befriended [[Alexander Pfänder]]), to obtain a degree in law, but then decided to go to study with Husserl at the [[University of Göttingen]]. In that period more students of Lipps (captained by Daubert) had decided to abandon Munich and to head for Göttingen, inspired by Husserl's works (which is referred to as the [[Munich invasion of Göttingen]]).

Later in 1905 Reinach returned to Munich to complete his studies in law and then continued in 1906–07 at the [[University of Tübingen]]. He attended several lectures and seminars on penal law by the legal theorist [[Ernst Beling]], by which he was quite impressed and to which he owes a great deal of inspiration of his later works. In the summer of 1907 he took the First State Examination in Law, but also went later to Göttingen to attend discussion circles with Husserl.

With the support of Husserl, Reinach was able to obtain habilitation for university teaching at Göttingen in 1909. From his lectures and research, we can see that at the time he was influenced also by [[Anton Marty]] and [[Johannes Daubert]], besides obviously and greatly by Husserl. On his turn Reinach appears to have inspired several young phenomenologists (like [[Wilhelm Schapp]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]], [[Alexandre Koyré]] and [[Edith Stein]]) with his lectures. Besides giving an introduction to phenomenology, he lectured i.a. on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].

In this period, Husserl embarked on a thorough revision of his main work, the ''Logical Investigations'', and asked Reinach’s assistance in this endeavour. Moreover, in 1912 Reinach, together with [[Moritz Geiger]] and [[Alexander Pfänder]] founded the famous ''Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische Forschung'', with [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] as main editor.

Besides his work in the area of phenomenology and philosophy in general, Reinach is credited for the development of a forerunner to the theory of [[speech act]]s by [[J. L. Austin|Austin]] and [[John Searle|Searle]]: ''Die apriorischen Grundlagen des bürgerlichen Rechtes'' ([[The A Priori Foundations of Civil Law]]) is a systematic treatment of social acts as [[performative utterances]] and ''a priori'' foundations of civil law. Reinach's work was based mostly on Husserl's analysis of meaning in the ''Logical Investigations'', but also on Daubert's criticism of it. [[Alexander Pfänder]] (1870–1941) had also been doing research on commands, promises and the like in the same period.

After Husserl's publication of the ''Ideen'' (Ideas) in 1913, many phenomenologists took a critical stance towards his new theories and the current of [[Munich phenomenology]] came effectively into being, as Reinach, Daubert and others chose to remain closer to Husserl's earlier work, the ''Logical investigations''. Instead of following Husserl into idealism and transcendental phenomenology, the Munich group remained a realist current.

Reinach was converted to [[Lutheranism]] along with his wife.<ref name=Waugh>{{Cite web |url=http://www.baltimorecarmel.org/saints/Stein/evelyn_waugh's%20book%20review.htm |title=A 1952 book review by Evelyn Waugh of a biography of Edith Stein by Sister Teresia de Spiritu Sancto, ODC |access-date=3 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905005413/http://www.baltimorecarmel.org/saints/Stein/evelyn_waugh's%20book%20review.htm |archive-date=5 September 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=vatican>[https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_19981011_edith_stein_en.html Teresa Benedict of the Cross Edith Stein (1891–1942)]</ref>

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] Reinach volunteered to join the army. After many battles and having received the [[Iron Cross]], Reinach fell outside Diksmuide in Flanders on 16 November 1917.

After his death, [[Edith Stein]] was given the task of arranging his manuscript writings. Reinach had said shortly before his death that he would only teach philosophy in the future as a means of leading men to God, and this may have been reflected in these writings. But Edith Stein was impressed by the resignation and faith of his widow.<ref name=Waugh/> She wrote, "This was my first encounter with the Cross and the divine power it imparts to those who bear it ... it was the moment when my unbelief collapsed and Christ began to shine his light on me – Christ in the mystery of the Cross."<ref name=vatican/> Several years later she became a Christian and a Carmelite nun.
