'''Étienne Henri Gilson''' ({{IPA|fr|ʒilsɔ̃|lang}}; 13 June 1884 – 19 September 1978) was a French [[philosopher]] and [[historian of philosophy]]. A [[scholar]] of [[medieval philosophy]], he originally specialised in the thought of [[Descartes]]; he also philosophized in the tradition of [[Thomas Aquinas]], although he did not consider himself a [[neo-Thomist]] philosopher. In 1946 he attained the distinction of being elected an "Immortal" (member) of the [[Académie française]]. He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=12464 |title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=19 April 2017}}</ref>

In 2009, the International Étienne Gilson Society was created “to promote the thought of Étienne Gilson and classical philosophy in the academy and culture.” It publishes a journal, ''Studia Gilsoniana''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gilsonsociety.com/?about,3#:~:text=The+International+%C3%89tienne+Gilson+Society,and+patronage+of+scholarly+enterprises|title=I.E.G.S. - I.É.G.S.|website=gilsonsociety.com}}</ref>

==Biography==
Born in [[Paris]] to a [[Roman Catholic]] family originally from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Gilson attended the [[minor seminary]] at Notre-Dame-des-Champs, then finished his secondary education at the [[Lycée Henri IV]]. After finishing his military service, during which he began to read [[René Descartes]], he studied for his ''[[Licentiate (degree)|licence]]'' (bachelor's degree), focusing on the influence of [[scholasticism]] on Cartesian thought. After studying at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] under [[Victor Delbos]] (1862–1916), and [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] and at the [[Collège de France]] under [[Henri Bergson]], he finished his degree in philosophy in 1906. 

In 1908, he married Thérèse Ravisé of Melun, and he taught in the high schools of [[Bourg-en-Bresse]], [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], [[Tours]], [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]] and [[Angers]]. In 1913, while employed in teaching at the [[Université Lille Nord de France|University of Lille]], he defended his doctoral dissertation at the [[University of Paris]] on "Liberty in Descartes and Theology" ("La Liberté chez Descartes et la Théologie"). 

His career was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War I]], as he was drafted into the [[French Army in World War I|French Army]] as a sergeant. He served on the front and took part in the [[Battle of Verdun]] as second lieutenant. He was captured in February 1916 and spent two years in captivity. During this time he devoted himself to new areas of study, including the [[Russian language]] and [[St. Bonaventure]]. He was later awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] for bravery in action.<ref>Michel, Florian (translated by James G. Colbert) ''Etienne Gilson: An Intellectual and Political Biography.'' Washington, DC. [[Catholic University of America Press]], 2023.</ref>

In 1919, he became professor of the [[history of philosophy]] at the [[University of Strasbourg]]. From 1921 to 1932, he taught the history of [[medieval philosophy]] at the [[University of Paris]]. At the invitation of the [[Congregation of St. Basil]], in 1929, he set up the [[Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies]] in [[Toronto]] in conjunction with [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]] at [[the University of Toronto]], which now hosts an annual Étienne Gilson Lecture. He was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1929.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Etienne-Henry Gilson |url=https://www.amacad.org/person/etienne-henry-gilson |access-date=2023-03-08 |website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences |date=9 February 2023 |language=en}}</ref> As an internationally renowned thinker, Gilson was first, along with [[Jacques Maritain]], to receive an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in philosophy from the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]] (''Angelicum'') in 1930.<ref name="Viotto 2008 p. 38">{{cite book | last=Viotto | first=P. | title=Grandi amicizie: i Maritain e i loro contemporanei | publisher=Città nuova | series=I Prismi.

He taught as a Visiting Professor of Philosophy at Indiana University for 1939-1940.
He also taught for three years at [[Harvard University|Harvard]].  He was elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1946. In 1948, he was elected an International Member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=APS Member History |url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=%C3%89tienne+Gilson&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced |access-date=2023-03-08 |website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>

With the death of his wife, Thérèse Ravisé, on 12 November 1949, Gilson endured a considerable emotional shock.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uowc.org/about/biography-of-etienne-gilson%E2%80%99s-intellectual-life/ |title=Biography of Étienne Gilson's Intellectual Life |access-date=27 December 2013 |archive-date=7 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007160006/http://www.uowc.org/about/biography-of-etienne-gilson%E2%80%99s-intellectual-life |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1951, he relinquished his chair to [[Martial Gueroult]] at the [[Collège de France]] to devote himself completely to the [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]] until 1968. He knew the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] theologian and cardinal [[Henri de Lubac]]. Their correspondence has been published. Although Gilson was primarily a historian of philosophy, he was also at the forefront of the 20th century revival of [[Thomism]], along with [[Jacques Maritain]]. His work has received critical praise from [[Richard McKeon]].

==Work==
{{Christian democracy sidebar|people}}
Gilson undertook an in-depth analysis of [[Thomism]] from a historical perspective. To Gilson, Thomism is certainly not identical with [[scholasticism]] in the pejorative sense, but rather a revolt against it.<ref>The Christian Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, University of Notre Dame Press, Indiana, 1956, pp. 366–367</ref> Gilson considered the philosophy of his own era to be deteriorating into a disipline which would signal humanity's abdication of the right to judge and rule nature, relegating humanity into a mere part of nature, which in turn would give the green light for the most reckless of social adventures to play havoc with human lives and institutions. Against "systems" of philosophy, Gilson was convinced that a revival of the philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]] would lead to the way out of that danger zone.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

In his time, Gilson was the leading scholar of the history of medieval philosophy as well as a highly regarded philosopher in his own right.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} His works continue to be reprinted and studied today – perhaps alone among "Thomist" philosophers, his work and reputation have not suffered from the general decline of interest in and regard for medieval philosophy since the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}
