'''Ernst Friedrich Ferdinand Zermelo''' ({{IPAc-en|z|ɜr|ˈ|m|ɛ|l|oʊ}}, {{IPA|de|tsɛɐ̯ˈmeːlo|lang}}; 27 July 1871{{spaced ndash}}21 May 1953) was a German [[logic]]ian and [[mathematician]], whose work has major implications for the [[foundations of mathematics]]. He is known for his role in developing [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel axiomatic set theory]] and his proof of the [[well-ordering theorem]]. Furthermore, his 1929<ref>{{cite journal |last=Zermelo |first=Ernst |title=Die Berechnung der Turnier-Ergebnisse als ein Maximumproblem der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung |language=de |journal=[[Mathematische Zeitschrift]] |volume=29 |number=1 |year=1929 |pages=436–460|doi=10.1007/BF01180541|s2cid=122877703 }}</ref> work on ranking chess players is the first description of a model for [[Pairwise comparison (psychology)|pairwise comparison]] that continues to have a profound impact on various applied fields utilizing this method.

==Life==
[[File:Ernst Zermelo.jpeg|thumb|Ernst Zermelo in Freiburg (1953)]]
Ernst Zermelo graduated from Berlin's Luisenstädtisches Gymnasium (now {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinrich-Schliemann-Oberschule|de|3=Heinrich-Schliemann-Oberschule (Gymnasium)|lt=Heinrich-Schliemann-Oberschule}}) in 1889. He then studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Berlin]], the [[University of Halle]], and the [[University of Freiburg]]. He finished his doctorate in 1894 at the University of Berlin, awarded for a dissertation on the [[calculus of variations]] (''Untersuchungen zur Variationsrechnung''). Zermelo remained at the University of Berlin, where he was appointed assistant to [[Max Planck|Planck]], under whose guidance he began to study [[hydrodynamics]]. In 1897, Zermelo went to the [[University of Göttingen]], at that time the leading centre for mathematical research in the world, where he completed his [[habilitation thesis]] in 1899.

In 1910, Zermelo left Göttingen upon being appointed to the chair of mathematics at [[University of Zurich|Zurich University]], which he resigned in 1916.
He was appointed to an honorary chair at the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1926, which he resigned in 1935 because he disapproved of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s regime.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kaplansky |first1=Irving |title=Set Theory and Metric Spaces |date=2020 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |location=Providence |isbn=978-1-4704-6384-7|pages=36–37}}</ref> At the end of [[World War II]] and at his request, Zermelo was reinstated to his honorary position in Freiburg.

==Research in set theory==

In 1900, in the Paris conference of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], [[David Hilbert]] challenged the mathematical community with his famous [[Hilbert's problems]], a list of 23 unsolved fundamental questions which mathematicians should attack during the coming century. The first of these, a problem of [[set theory]], was the [[continuum hypothesis]] introduced by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] in 1878, and in the course of its statement Hilbert mentioned also the need to prove the [[well-ordering theorem]].

Zermelo began to work on the problems of set theory under Hilbert's influence and in 1902 published his first work concerning the addition of [[Cardinal numbers|transfinite cardinals]]. By that time he had also discovered the so-called [[Russell paradox]]. In 1904, he succeeded in taking the first step suggested by Hilbert towards the continuum hypothesis when he proved the [[well-ordering theorem]] (''every set can be well ordered''). This result brought fame to Zermelo, who was appointed Professor in Göttingen, in 1905. His proof of the [[well-ordering theorem]], based on the powerset axiom and the [[axiom of choice]], was not accepted by all mathematicians, mostly because the axiom of choice was a paradigm of non-constructive mathematics. In 1908, Zermelo succeeded in producing an improved proof making use of Dedekind's notion of the "chain" of a set, which became more widely accepted; this was mainly because that same year he also offered an [[axiomatization]] of set theory.

Zermelo began to axiomatize set theory in 1905; in 1908, he published his results despite his failure to prove the consistency of his axiomatic system. See the article on [[Zermelo set theory]] for an outline of this paper, together with the original axioms, with the original numbering.

In 1922, [[Abraham Fraenkel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]] independently improved Zermelo's axiom system. The resulting system, now called [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]] (ZF), is now the most commonly used system for [[axiomatic set theory]].

==Zermelo's navigation problem==
Proposed in 1931, the [[Zermelo's navigation problem]] is a classic [[optimal control]] problem. The problem deals with a boat navigating on a body of water, originating from a point O to a destination point D. The boat is capable of a certain maximum speed, and we want to derive the best possible control to reach D in the least possible time.

Without considering external forces such as current and wind, the optimal control is for the boat to always head towards D. Its path then is a line segment from O to D, which is trivially optimal. With consideration of current and wind, if the combined force applied to the boat is non-zero, the control for no current and wind does not yield the optimal path.
