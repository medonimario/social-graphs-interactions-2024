'''Gershom Carmichael''' (1672&ndash;1729) was a Scottish philosopher.

Gershom Carmichael was a Scottish subject born in [[London]], the son of Alexander Charmichael, a [[Church of Scotland minister]] who had been [[Exile|banished]] by the [[Scottish privy council]] for his religious opinions. As a child, he suffered from crooked limbs (probably [[rickets]]) and was treated by "body menders" who made him wear limb braces. Through his friendship with the [[Duke of Hamilton]],{{who|date=October 2023}} Carmichael visited [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to take the waters and he was eventually able to dispense with the braces.<ref>Peirce, R.  "Memoirs of the Bath". Bath.  1713</ref>

Carmichael graduated at [[university of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]] in 1691, and became a [[Governance of the University of St Andrews|regent]] at [[St Andrews]]. In 1694 he was elected a master in the [[university of Glasgow]] – an office that was converted into the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow|professorship of moral philosophy]] in 1727, when the system of masters was abolished at Glasgow.  He died in [[Glasgow]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]] regarded him as "the real founder of the [[Scottish school of philosophy]]".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He wrote ''Breviuscula Introductio ad Logicam'', a treatise on [[logic]] and the [[psychology]] of the intellectual powers, combining [[Antoine Arnauld|Arnauld]] and [[Pierre Nicole|Nicole]] with [[John Locke|Locke]];<ref name=CHECP>
