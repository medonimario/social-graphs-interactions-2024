'''Martin Anton Maurus Marty''' ({{IPA|de|ˈmarti|lang}}; 18 October 1847{{spaced ndash}}1 October 1914) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-born [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[philosopher]] and [[Catholic priest]]. He specialized in [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of psychology]], and [[ontology]].

==Biography==
Marty was a student and follower of [[Franz Brentano]], his teacher at the [[University of Würzburg]] in 1868–70. He was [[ordained]] in 1870, but resigned from the [[priesthood]] in 1872. 

His academic career began at [[University of Göttingen|Gottingen]] where, under [[Hermann Lotze]], he took his degree by submitting an 1875 thesis on the origin of language entitled ''Kritik der Theorien uber den Sprachursprung.''<ref name=":0">{{Citation |last=Albertazzi |first=Liliana |title=Anton Marty (1847–1914) |date=1996 |work=The School of Franz Brentano |series=Nijhoff International Philosophy Series |volume=52 |pages=83–108 |editor-last=Albertazzi |editor-first=Liliana |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-94-015-8676-4_3 |access-date=2024-02-18 |place=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer Netherlands |doi=10.1007/978-94-015-8676-4_3 |isbn=978-90-481-4628-4 |editor2-last=Libardi |editor2-first=Massimo |editor3-last=Poli |editor3-first=Roberto |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title='Kritik der Theorien über den Sprachursprung : Inauguraldissertation' - Details {{!}} MDZ |url=https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/en/details/bsb11317878 |access-date=2024-02-18 |website=www.digitale-sammlungen.de}}</ref> An expanded version of which was also published that same year.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Marty |first=Anton |url=http://archive.org/details/ueberdenursprun00martgoog |title=Ueber den ursprung der sprache |date=1875 |publisher=A.

He taught at the [[Franz-Josephs-Universität Czernowitz]] from 1875 to 1880. He then taught at the [[Charles University#Charles-Ferdinand University (1622–1882)|Charles-Ferdinand University]] in [[Prague]].<ref name=":0" /> Both universities fell within the [[Cisleithanian|Austrian]] territories of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]] at that time, as they would for the remainder of Marty's lifetime. The latter university would soon after his appointment split into two separate, though linked, Czech and German institutions. Marty would remain at the [[Charles University#Split into Czech and German universities|German Charles-Ferdinand University]], where he would also serve as dean and then rector, until his retirement in 1913.<ref name=":0" /> 

He died in 1914 at the age of 66.

==Thought==
Marty was concerned with a [[Diachrony and synchrony|synchronic]] analysis of language itself and has been described as a precursor to [[Structural linguistics|linguistic structuralist]]s.<ref name=SEP/> Marty distinguished between 'autosemantica' and 'synsemantica', the former can be used by themselves and the latter cannot. Examples of autosemantica include things like [[nouns]] and [[proper names]] while examples of the latter are things like [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thass-Thienemann |first1=Theodore |url=https://archive.org/details/understandingsym0001thas |title=The Interpretation of Language Volume 1: Understanding the Symbolic Meaning of Language |date=1973 |publisher=[[Jason Aronson]] |isbn=0-87668-087-2 |page=141 |chapter=Repetition |quote=In descriptive linguistics two elements can be distinguished in every utterance. On the one hand, there are independent words, nouns, proper names, called ''autosemantica''. On the other hand, one can find verbal elements, ''synsemantica'', which cannot be used independently. [...] This distinction was first introduced by the inaugurator of descriptive linguistics, Anton Marty. |url-access=registration |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref><ref name=SEP/> He used the term 'impersonals' to refer to expressions he considered to be without a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] like "it is raining".<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Rollinger |first1=Robin D |title=Anton Marty & Karl Bühler: Between Mind and Language |date=2014 |publisher=[[Schwabe Verlag]] |isbn=9783796532146 |editor-last=Cesalli |editor-first=Laurent |editor-link=Laurent Cesalli |page=176 |chapter=Brentano and Marty on Logical Names and Linguistic Fictions: A Parting of Ways in the Philosophy of Language. |author-link=Laurent Cesalli |editor-last2=Friedrich |editor-first2=Janette}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The [[Prague School]] linguists were influenced by his works.<ref>[[Roman Jakobson]] (1933), [[iarchive:selectedwritings02jako/page/541/mode/1up|"La scuola linguistica di Praga"]], ''La cultura'' 12, 633–641, esp. p. 637., reprinted in ''[[iarchive:selectedwritings02jako|Selected Writings]]'' (1962)</ref> 

[[Franz Kafka]] also attended his philosophy lectures while at the University of Prague.<ref>{{cite book |author=Heims |first=Neil |url=https://archive.org/details/franzkafka0000unse_k0s2 |title=Franz Kafka |date=2004 |publisher=Chelsea House |isbn=079107871X |editor=Harold Bloom |editor-link=Harold Bloom |edition=1st |location=Philadelphia |page=28 |chapter=Biography of Franz Kafka |quote=Besides attending lectures twenty hours a week on German, Roman, and ecclesiastical law, Kafka attended lectures on German literature, art history, and philosophy. The philosophy lectures he attended were delivered by Anton Marty who had been a pupil of Franz Brentano, a philosopher concerned with the unity of consciousness and its objects, and upon whose work, [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] built Phenomenology. Through Marty, Kafka gained admittance to the “exclusive Brentano circle which met once a fortnight at the Café Louvre.” ([[Ronald Hayman|Hayman]] 36) |url-access=registration |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>
