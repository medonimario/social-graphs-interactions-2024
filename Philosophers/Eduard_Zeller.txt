'''Eduard Gottlob Zeller''' ({{IPA|de|ˈtsɛlɐ|lang}}; 22 January 1814, [[Steinheim an der Murr|Kleinbottwar]]{{snd}}19 March 1908, [[Stuttgart]]) was a [[Germans|German]] [[philosopher]] and [[Protestant]] [[theologian]] of the [[Tübingen School of theology]]. He was well known for his writings on [[Ancient Greek philosophy]], especially [[Pre-Socratic Philosophy]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Rethinking Revolutions Through Ancient Greece|page=221|author=Simon Goldhill|author-link=Simon Goldhill| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_arvTBpCf6MC&pg=PA221|isbn=978-0-521-86212-7|date=2006-09-28|publisher=Cambridge University Press }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2IqpqA9wj4C&pg=PP23|title=Parmenides and Presocratic Philosophy|author=John Palmer|page=23|isbn=978-0-19-160999-2|date=2009-10-29|publisher=OUP Oxford }}</ref> and most of all for his celebrated, multi-volume historical treatise ''The Philosophy of Greeks in their Historical Development'' (1844–52).<ref>''Die Philosophie der Griechen in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung''</ref> Zeller was also a central figure in the revival of [[neo-Kantianism]].<ref name=kant>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nU1VBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA255|title=The Genesis of Neo-Kantianism, 1796–1880|author=Frederick C.

==Life==
Eduard Zeller was born at Kleinbottwar in [[Württemberg]], the son of a government official. He was educated first at the [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren]] starting in 1831, and later at the [[University of Tübingen]] (the [[Tübinger Stift]]), then much under the influence of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Presocratic Philosophy|author=Patricia Curd|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=14muxtEiBG0C&pg=PA14|isbn=978-0-19-514687-5|date=2008-10-27|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA }}</ref> He received his doctorate in 1836 with a thesis on [[Plato]]'s [[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]].  In 1840 he was ''[[Privatdozent]]'' of [[theology]] at Tübingen, in 1847 professor of theology at [[University of Berne|Berne]], and in 1849 professor of theology at [[Marburg]], where he soon shifted to the philosophy faculty as the result of disputes with the Clerical party. He became professor of philosophy at the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1862, moved to Berlin in 1872, and retired around 1895. He remained best known for his ''The Philosophy of Greeks in their Historical Development'' (1844–52). He continued to expand and improve this work to reflect new research, and the last edition appeared in 1902. It was translated into most European languages and became the standard textbook on Greek philosophy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Zeller also published many works on theology and three volumes of philosophical essays. He was also one of the founders of the ''Theologische Jahrbücher'' (Theological Yearbooks), a periodical which became well known as the exponent of the [[historical method]] of [[David Friedrich Strauss|David Strauss]] and [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|Christian Baur]]. He wrote much on the debate about whether theology was a kind of science (''Wissenschaft'').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pThLAAAAQBAJ|pages=96–123|title=Theology as Science in Nineteenth Century Germany: From F. C. Baur to Ernst Troeltsch|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Johannes Zachhuber|isbn=978-0-19-964191-8}}</ref> Like most of his contemporaries, including [[Friedrich Theodor Vischer]], he began with [[Hegelianism]], but subsequently developed a system of his own. He felt the necessity of going back to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and critically reconsidering the [[epistemological]] problems which, he believed, Kant had only partially resolved.<ref name=kant/>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Philosophical work==
Nonetheless, his accomplishments in the history of philosophy were far more influential than his contributions as an original thinker. Zeller's conception of the history of Greek thought was influenced by the [[dialectic]]al philosophy of Hegel. Some critics maintain that Zeller was not alive enough to cultural context and to the [[idiosyncrasies]] of individual thinkers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Some hold that he laid too much stress upon Hegel's notion of "[[concept]]", and relied too much on the [[Hegelian]] [[antithesis]] of [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]], though his history of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] was nonetheless influential and highly regarded. He received the highest recognition, not only from philosophers and learned societies all over the world, but also from the [[German emperor]] and German people. In 1894 the [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Emperor Wilhelm II]] made him a "''Wirklicher Geheimrat''" with the title of "''Excellenz''," and his bust, along with that of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]], was set up at the [[Brandenburg Gate]] near the statues erected to the Emperor and Empress Frederick.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The ''Philosophie der Griechen'' has been translated into English by S. F. Alleyne (2 vols, 1881) in sections: S. F. Alleyne, ''History of Greek Philosophy to the time of Socrates'' (1881) [https://archive.org/details/historyofgreekph00zell ''Volume 1''] and [https://archive.org/details/ahistorygreekph01allegoog ''Volume 2'']; O. J. Reichel, [https://archive.org/details/socratesandtheso00zelluoft ''Socrates and the Socratic Schools''] (1868; 2nd ed. 1877; 3rd ed. 1885); S. F. Alleyne and A.

Zeller was also, in his ''Philosophie der Griechen'', one of the first to use the word 'Superhuman' (''übermensch''), later central in [[Nietzsche]] and the propaganda of the [[Nazi Party]], in adjectival form as a technical term in philosophy. He said "... thus the happiness in her can be designated superhuman (''übermenschliche'') while in contrast the happiness flowing from ethical virtues is merely a characteristic human good.'<ref>"...''so kann die Glückseligkeit, welche in ihr besteht, auch als eine '''übermenschliche''', die Glückseligkeit der ethischen Tugend dagegen als das eigenthümlich menschliche Gut bezeichnet werden.''"</ref>
