{{Short description|Character in Plato's dialogues; purported ancient Greek philosopher}}
'''Timaeus of Locri''' ({{IPAc-en|t|aɪ|ˈ|m|iː|ə|s}}; {{langx|grc|Τίμαιος ὁ Λοκρός|Tímaios ho Lokrós}}; {{langx|la|Timaeus Locrus}}) is a character in two of [[Plato]]'s [[dialogue]]s, ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''. In both, he appears as a [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosopher]] of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean school]]. If there ever existed a historical Timaeus of Locri, he would have lived in the fifth century [[Before Christ|BC]], but his historicity is dubious since he only appears as a literary figure in Plato's works; all other ancient sources are either based on Plato or are fictional accounts.

==Historicity==
In Plato's works, Timaeus appears as a wealthy aristocrat from the [[Magna Graecia|Greek colony]] of Lokroi Epizephyrioi (present-day [[Locri]] in [[Calabria]]) in [[Magna Graecia]], who had served in high offices in his native town before coming to Athens, where the dialogue of ''Timaeus'' is set. Plato does not explicitly label Timaeus a Pythagorean, but leaves enough hints for the reader to infer this. He appears competent in all areas of ancient philosophy, especially [[natural philosophy]] and [[Ancient Greek astronomy|astronomy]].<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus'' 20a, 27a.</ref>

In antiquity, Timaeus's historical existence was beyond dispute. [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]] reports that Plato traveled to Italy to study with Timaeus and other Pythagoreans.<ref>Cicero, ''[[De re publica]]'' 1,16 and ''[[De finibus bonorum et malorum]]'' 5,87; [[Valerius Maximus]] 8,7 ext. 3 is based on the latter account.</ref> The report of this meeting led [[Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius|Macrobius]], a writer of [[late antiquity]], to conclude that Timaeus could not have been in a face-to-face dialogue with [[Socrates]], who, by Timaeus's time, was long dead.<ref>Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1,1,5.</ref> [[Iamblichus]] lists Timaeus among the notable members of the Pythagorean school. [[Diogenes Laërtius]] in his ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', suggests that the character of Timaeus was based on the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Philolaus]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Laertius|first=Diogenes|editor=trans R.

Modern scholarship tends to dismiss Timaeus's historicity,<ref>E.g., {{cite book |title=Plato's Cosmology: The Timaeus of Plato |first=Francis M. |last=Cornford |author-link=Francis Cornford |year=1937 |pages=2–3}}</ref> treating him as a literary figure constructed by Plato from features of the Pythagoreans known to him, such as [[Archytas]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Burkert |author-link=Walter Burkert |title=Weisheit und Wissenschaft |location=Nürnberg |year=1962 |page=75}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Charles H. |last=Kahn | author-link = Charles H.

==''On the Nature of the World and the Soul''==
[[File:Pseudo-Timaeus of Locri, On the Nature of the World and the Soul.jpg|thumb|Pseudo-Timaios of Locri, ''On the Nature of the World and the Soul'' in a manuscript in the possession of Cardinal [[Bessarion]]. Venice, [[Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana]], Gr. 517, fol. 4r (15th century)]]
A work in [[Doric Greek]] entitled ''On the Nature of the World and the Soul'' ({{langx|grc|Περὶ φύσιος κόσμω καὶ ψυχᾶς|Peri phýsios kósmō kai psychās}}), also called the ''Timaeus Locrus'' after its purported author, starts out by declaring that: "Timaeus of Locri said the following", and proceeds to summarize the theories that Timaeus defends in Plato's ''Timaeus''. The book has been preserved fully, in more than fifty manuscripts.{{r|marg}}{{rp|76 ff.}} It is mostly consistent with Plato;<ref name="harder">{{cite encyclopedia |first=Richard |last=Harder |title=Timaios |encyclopedia=[[Realencyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft]] |volume=VI A,1 |year=1936 |pages=1203–1226}}</ref>{{rp|1205–20}} it notably omits the [[Theory of Forms]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=The "Timaeus Locrus" |first=G. |last=Ryle |journal=[[Phronesis (journal)|Phronesis]] |volume=10 |issue=2 |year=1965 |pages=174–190 |doi=10.1163/156852865X00149 |jstor=4181767}}</ref>

''On the World and the Soul'' was first mentioned in sources of the second century AD ([[Nicomachus]] and the commentary on ''Timaeus'' by [[Calvisius Taurus]]) and its authenticity was not doubted in antiquity.
The work was even believed to have been a main source for Plato's dialogue; a rumor dating back to the third century BC held that Plato's ''Timaeus'' was [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] from a Pythagorean book, and this became connected to the ''Timaeus Locrus''.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Alice |last=Swift Riginos |year=1976 |title=Platonica. The Anecdotes concerning the Life and Writings of Plato |location=Leiden |pages=169–174}}</ref>

Modern [[philology]] has shown that ''On the World and the Soul'' is a [[pseudepigraphon]] from somewhere between the early first century BC<ref>{{Cite web |first=Edward |last=Moore |title=Middle Platonism |website=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/midplato/#SH5b |access-date=6 January 2016}}</ref> to the early first century AD, and is based on Plato's ''Timaeus'', rather than the other way around.<ref name="baltes">{{cite book |first=Matthias |last=Baltes |title=Timaios Lokros, Über die Natur des Kosmos und der Seele |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year=1972}}</ref>{{rp|1–3, 20–26}}<ref name="tobin">{{cite book |editor-first=Thomas H. |editor-last=Tobin |title=Timaios of Locri, On the Nature of the World and the Soul |location=Chico, California |year=1985}}</ref>{{rp|3–7}} The Pseudo-Timaeus employs a simplified mode of reasoning and presentation, presenting conclusions rather than arguments and omitting any dialogue, meaning that it was perhaps intended as a summary of the notoriously difficult original for use in a classroom setting. While it may have originated in part as a set of lecture notes to the Platonic original, it tends to omit difficult sections of the ''Timaeus'' rather than provide explanations.<ref>{{cite book |first=H. Greg |last=Snyder |title=Teachers and Texts in the Ancient World: Philosophers, Jews and Christians |publisher=Routledge |page=109 |year=2002 |isbn=9781134603374 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pZhsBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA109}}</ref> Some of Pseudo-Timaeus's theses are very hard to understand without knowledge of Plato's work.{{r|harder}}{{rp|1219–1221}}

''On the World and the Soul'' shows traces of [[Middle Platonism|middle Platonist]] ideas and terminology; in particular, it resembles works by [[Eudorus of Alexandria]] and [[Philo]], making it plausible that the author lived in [[Alexandria]] and was familiar with Eudorus's philosophy.{{r|baltes}}{{rp|20–26}} He modernized the natural philosophy of Plato's ''Timaeus'' by incorporating insights from [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] astronomy and medicine.

The book also appears to incorporate material from one or more now-lost commentaries on ''Timaeus''. R. Harder hypothesized that the composition of ''On the World and the Soul'' was a two-step process, whereby Pseudo-Timaeus, the author of the preserved version of the book, would have edited an earlier, Hellenistic variant<!-- "variant" may not be the correct translation of "Bearbeitung" --> of ''Timaeus''.{{r|harder}}{{rp|1220–1226}}<ref>Harder's hypothesis is accepted by {{cite journal |first=Bruno |last=Centrone |title=La cosmologia di pseudo Timeo di Locri ed il Timeo di Platone |journal=Elenchos |volume=3 |year=1982 |pages=293–324}}</ref> Th. Tobin, by contrast, believes the work to have been composed at once, then translated into Doric.{{r|tobin}}{{rp|17–19}}

===Reception===
''On the Nature of the World and the Soul'' was known to the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] Iamblichus, Syrianus, Proclus, and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]].{{r|marg}}{{rp|88–110}} The work of Pseudo-Timaeus supported the widely held Neoplatonist conviction that Pythagoreanism and Platonism constituted a singular theory, reflecting the pseudonymous author's intention of placing Plato in the Pythagorean tradition.

[[Giorgio Valla]], in the fifteenth century, translated ''On the Nature of the World and the Soul'' into [[Latin]]. His translation was printed in [[Venice]] in 1498. The Greek text appeared as part of [[Aldo Manuzio]]'s collected works of Plato, first published in 1513 and reprinted many times. In the sixteenth century, it was considered a ''[[Vorlage]]'' of the ''Timaeus'' (so in [[Henri Estienne]]'s edition) and often printed along with the works of Plato.

==Attributions of other works==
The ''[[Suda]]'' and various [[scholia]] on Plato's ''Timaeus'' ascribe to Timaeus of Locri a work entitled ''Mathēmatiká'', of which nothing else is known. This is possibly a false attribution, confusing Timaeus with an astronomer bearing the same name. He is also reported to have authored a biography of [[Pythagoras]], but this may be a confusion with the historian [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus of Tauromenium]], who devoted part of his history to Pythagoras's life and work.
