'''George Boole Jnr''' {{post-nominals|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|b|uː|l}}; 2 November 1815 – 8 December 1864) was a largely [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]] English [[mathematician]], [[philosopher]] and [[logician]], most of whose short career was spent as the first professor of mathematics at [[Queen's College, Cork]] in Ireland.  He worked in the fields of [[differential equation]]s and [[algebraic logic]], and is best known as the author of ''[[The Laws of Thought]]'' (1854), which contains [[Boolean algebra]]. Boolean logic, essential to [[computer programming]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-boolean-logic/ |title=What Boolean Logic Is & How It's Used In Programming |last=Klein |first=Michael |date=21 March 2022 |website=Codecademy |access-date=31 August 2024}}</ref> is credited with helping to lay the foundations for the [[Information Age]].<ref name="Commemoration"/><ref>{{Cite book |last=Nahin |first=Paul J. |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.cttq957s |title=The Logician and the Engineer: How George Boole and Claude Shannon Created the Information Age |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2012 |jstor=j.cttq957s |isbn=978-0691176000 |language=en |author-link=Paul J.

Boole was the son of a shoemaker. He received a primary school education and learned Latin and modern languages through various means. At 16, he began teaching to support his family. He established his own school at 19 and later ran a boarding school in Lincoln. Boole was an active member of local societies and collaborated with fellow mathematicians.

In 1849, Boole was appointed the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork (now University College Cork) in Ireland, where he met his future wife, [[Mary Everest Boole|Mary Everest]]. He continued his involvement in social causes and maintained connections with Lincoln. In 1864, Boole died due to fever-induced [[Pleural effusion|pleural effusion]] after developing [[Pneumonia|pneumonia]].

Boole published around 50 articles and several separate publications in his lifetime. Some of his key works include a paper on early invariant theory and "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic," which introduced symbolic logic. Boole also wrote two systematic treatises: "Treatise on Differential Equations" and "Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences." He contributed to the theory of linear differential equations and the study of the sum of residues of a rational function. In 1847, Boole developed Boolean algebra, a fundamental concept in binary logic, which laid the groundwork for the algebra of logic tradition and forms the foundation of digital circuit design and modern computer science. Boole also attempted to discover a general method in probabilities, focusing on determining the consequent probability of events logically connected to given probabilities. His work was expanded upon by various scholars, such as Charles Sanders Peirce and William Stanley Jevons. Boole's ideas later gained practical applications when Claude Shannon and Victor Shestakov employed Boolean algebra to optimize the design of electromechanical relay systems, leading to the development of modern electronic digital computers. University College Cork celebrated the 200th anniversary of Boole's birth in 2015, highlighting his significant impact on the digital age.

Boole's contributions to mathematics earned him various honours, including the Royal Society's first gold prize for mathematics, the Keith Medal, and honorary degrees from the Universities of Dublin and Oxford.

==Works==
Boole's first published paper was "Researches in the theory of analytical transformations, with a special application to the reduction of the general equation of the second order", printed in the ''[[Cambridge Mathematical Journal]]'' in February 1840 (Volume 2, No. 8, pp. 64–73), and it led to his friendship with [[Duncan Farquharson Gregory]], the editor of the journal.<ref name="EB1911"/> His works are in about 50 articles and a few separate publications.<ref>A list of Boole's memoirs and papers is in the ''Catalogue of Scientific Memoirs'' published by the [[Royal Society]], and in the supplementary volume on differential equations, edited by [[Isaac Todhunter]]. To the ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'' and its successor, the ''[[Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal]]'', Boole contributed 22 articles in all. In the third and fourth series of the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'' are found 16 papers. The Royal Society printed six memoirs in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'', and a few other memoirs are to be found in the ''Transactions'' of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] and of the [[Royal Irish Academy]], in the ''Bulletin de l'Académie de St-Pétersbourg'' for 1862 (under the name G. Boldt, vol. iv. pp.&nbsp;198–215), and in ''[[Crelle's Journal]]''. Also included is a paper on the mathematical basis of logic, published in ''[[The Mechanics' Magazine]]'' in 1848.</ref><ref name="auto"/>

In 1841, Boole published an influential paper in early [[invariant theory]].<ref name=SED/> He received a medal from the [[Royal Society]] for his memoir of 1844, "On a General Method in Analysis".<ref name="EB1911"/> It was a contribution to the theory of [[linear differential equation]]s, moving from the case of constant coefficients on which he had already published, to variable coefficients.<ref>[[Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov]], [[Adolf Pavlovich Yushkevich]] (editors), ''Mathematics of the 19th Century: function theory according to Chebyshev, ordinary differential equations, calculus of variations, theory of finite differences'' (1998), pp. 130–2; [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mw6JMdZQO-wC&pg=PA130 Google Books] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510024525/https://books.google.com/books?id=Mw6JMdZQO-wC&pg=PA130 |date=10 May 2016 }}.</ref> The innovation in operational methods is to admit that operations may not [[commutative law|commute]].<ref>[[Jeremy Gray]], [[Karen Hunger Parshall]], ''Episodes in the History of Modern Algebra (1800–1950)'' (2007), p. 66; [https://books.google.com/books?id=zMSl6QLlJZsC&pg=PA66 Google Books] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516223338/https://books.google.com/books?id=zMSl6QLlJZsC&pg=PA66 |date=16 May 2016 }}.</ref> In 1847, Boole published ''The Mathematical Analysis of Logic'', the first of his works on symbolic logic.<ref>George Boole, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zv4YAQAAIAAJ&pg=PP9 ''The Mathematical Analysis of Logic, Being an Essay towards a Calculus of Deductive Reasoning''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511151325/https://books.google.com/books?id=zv4YAQAAIAAJ&pg=PP9 |date=11 May 2016 }} (London, England: Macmillan, Barclay, & Macmillan, 1847).</ref>

===Differential equations===
Boole completed two systematic treatises on mathematical subjects during his lifetime. The ''Treatise on [[Differential equation|Differential Equations]]''<ref>George Boole, ''A treatise on differential equations'' (1859), [https://archive.org/details/atreatiseondiff06boolgoog Internet Archive].</ref> appeared in 1859, and was followed, the next year, by a ''Treatise on the [[Calculus]] of Finite Differences'',<ref>George Boole, ''A treatise on the calculus of finite differences'' (1860), [https://archive.org/details/treatiseoncalcul00geor  Internet Archive].</ref> a sequel to the former work.<ref name="EB1911"/>
Shortly after his death, Todhunter republished Boole's treatise with some of Boole's revisions, along with a supplement that was originally intended to be merged in the making of the second edition.

===Analysis===
In 1857, Boole published the treatise "On the Comparison of Transcendent, with Certain Applications to the Theory of Definite Integrals",<ref>{{cite journal |title=On the Comparison of Transcendent, with Certain Applications to the Theory of Definite Integrals |first=George |last=Boole |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=147 |year=1857 |pages=745–803 |jstor=108643 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1857.0037|doi-access=free }}</ref> in which he studied the sum of [[residue (complex analysis)|residues]] of a [[rational function]].

===Binary logic===
{{main|Boolean algebra}}
In 1847, Boole published the pamphlet ''Mathematical Analysis of Logic''. He later regarded it as a flawed exposition of his logical system and wanted ''[[The Laws of Thought|An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities]]'' to be seen as the mature statement of his views.<ref name="EB1911"/> Contrary to widespread belief, Boole never intended to criticise or disagree with the main principles of [[Aristotle]]'s logic. Rather he intended to systematise it, to provide it with a foundation, and to extend its range of applicability.<ref>[[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]], Aristotle's Prior Analytics and Boole's Laws of Thought, History and Philosophy of Logic, vol.  24 (2003), pp. 261–288.</ref> Boole's initial involvement in logic was prompted by a current debate on [[quantification (logic)|quantification]], between [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]] who supported the theory of "quantification of the predicate", and Boole's supporter [[Augustus De Morgan]] who advanced a version of [[De Morgan duality]], as it is now called. Boole's approach was ultimately much further reaching than either sides' in the controversy.<ref name=ODNB>{{ODNBweb|id=2868|title=Boole, George|first=I.|last=Grattan-Guinness}}</ref> It founded what was first known as the "algebra of logic" tradition.<ref name=Marc>Witold Marciszewski (editor), ''Dictionary of Logic as Applied in the Study of Language'' (1981), pp. 194–5.</ref>

Among his many innovations is his principle of [[wholistic reference]], which was later, and probably independently, adopted by [[Gottlob Frege]] and by logicians who subscribe to standard first-order logic. A 2003 article<ref>[[John Corcoran (logician)|Corcoran, John]] (2003). "Aristotle's Prior Analytics and Boole's Laws of Thought". ''History and Philosophy of Logic'', '''24''': 261–288.

Also by Marcel Guillaume, ''Mathematical Reviews'' 2033867 (2004m:03006).</ref> provides a systematic comparison and critical evaluation of [[Aristotelian logic]] and [[Boolean logic]]; it also reveals the centrality of holistic reference in Boole's [[philosophy of logic]].

====1854 definition of the universe of discourse====
<blockquote>In every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them, the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilised men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the [[universe of discourse]]. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.<ref>George Boole. 1854/2003.

====Treatment of addition in logic====
Boole conceived of "elective symbols" of his kind as an [[algebraic structure]]. But this general concept was not available to him: he did not have the segregation standard in [[abstract algebra]] of postulated (axiomatic) properties of operations, and deduced properties.<ref name=KY>[[Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov]], [[Adolf Pavlovich Yushkevich]], ''Mathematics of the 19th century: mathematical logic, algebra, number theory, probability theory'' (2001), pp. 15 (note 15)–16; [https://books.google.com/books?id=X3u5hJCkobYC&pg=PA15 Google Books] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517144440/https://books.google.com/books?id=X3u5hJCkobYC&pg=PA15 |date=17 May 2016 }}.</ref> His work was a beginning to the [[algebra of sets]], again not a concept available to Boole as a familiar model. His pioneering efforts encountered specific difficulties, and the treatment of addition was an obvious difficulty in the early days.

Boole replaced the operation of multiplication by the word "and" and addition by the word "or". But in Boole's original system, + was a [[partial operation]]: in the language of [[set theory]] it would correspond only to [[disjoint union]] of subsets. Later authors changed the interpretation, commonly reading it as [[exclusive or]], or in set theory terms [[symmetric difference]]; this step means that addition is always defined.<ref name=Marc/><ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=algebra-logic-tradition |title=The Algebra of Logic Tradition |last=Burris |first=Stanley}}</ref>

In fact, there is the other possibility, that + should be read as [[disjunction]].<ref name=KY/> This other possibility extends from the disjoint union case, where exclusive or and non-exclusive or both give the same answer. Handling this ambiguity was an early problem of the theory, reflecting the modern use of both [[Boolean ring]]s and Boolean algebras (which are simply different aspects of one type of structure). Boole and [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] struggled over just this issue in 1863, in the form of the correct evaluation of ''x'' + ''x''. Jevons argued for the result ''x'', which is correct for + as disjunction. Boole kept the result as something undefined. He argued against the result 0, which is correct for exclusive or, because he saw the equation ''x'' + ''x'' = 0 as implying ''x'' = 0, a false analogy with ordinary algebra.<ref name=SED/>

===Probability theory===
The second part of the ''Laws of Thought'' contained a corresponding attempt to discover a [[Probability theory|general method in probabilities]]. Here the goal was algorithmic: from the given probabilities of any system of events, to determine the consequent probability of any other event logically connected with those events.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boole |first=George |title=An Investigation of the Laws of Thought |publisher=Walton & Maberly |year=1854 |location=London |pages=265–275 |isbn=9780790592428 |url=https://archive.org/stream/investigationofl00boolrich#page/264/mode/2up}}</ref><ref name="EB1911"/>

==Legacy==

Boole is the namesake of the branch of algebra known as [[Boolean algebra]], as well as the namesake of the [[lunar craters|lunar crater]] [[Boole (crater)|Boole]]. The keyword ''Bool'' represents a [[Boolean data type]] in many programming languages, though [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], among others, both use the full name ''Boolean''.<ref>P.

A road called ''Boole Heights'' in Bracknell, Berkshire is named after him.

===19th-century development===
Boole's work was extended and refined by a number of writers, beginning with [[William Stanley Jevons]], who also authored the article about Boole in the ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''. [[Augustus De Morgan]] had worked on the [[logic of relations]], and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] integrated his work with Boole's during the 1870s.<ref name="GGB">[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]], Gérard Bornet, ''George Boole: Selected manuscripts on logic and its philosophy'' (1997), p. xlvi; [https://books.google.com/books?id=pzg7UFsIVJIC&pg=PR46 Google Books] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425113513/https://books.google.com/books?id=pzg7UFsIVJIC&pg=PR46|date=25 April 2016}}.</ref> Other significant figures were [[Platon Sergeevich Poretskii]], and [[William Ernest Johnson]]. The conception of a Boolean algebra structure on equivalent statements of a [[propositional calculus]] is credited to [[Hugh MacColl]] (1877), in work surveyed 15 years later by Johnson.<ref name=GGB/> Surveys of these developments were published by [[Ernst Schröder (mathematician)|Ernst Schröder]], [[Louis Couturat]], and [[Clarence Irving Lewis]].

===20th-century development===
[[File:Hasse2Free.png|thumb|In modern notation, the [[free Boolean algebra]] on basic propositions ''p'' and ''q'' arranged in a [[Hasse diagram]]. The Boolean combinations make up 16 different propositions, and the lines show which are logically related.]]

In 1921, the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] published a book on probability theory, ''A Treatise of Probability''. Keynes believed that Boole had made a fundamental error in his definition of independence which vitiated much of his analysis.<ref>Chapter XVI, p. 167, section 6 of ''A treatise on probability'', volume 4: "The central error in his system of probability arises out of his giving two inconsistent definitions of 'independence' (2) He first wins the reader's acquiescence by giving a perfectly correct definition: "Two events are said to be independent when the probability of either of them is unaffected by our ''expectation'' of the occurrence or failure of the other." (3) But a moment later he interprets the term in quite a different sense; for, according to Boole's second definition, we must regard the events as independent unless we are told either that they ''must'' concur or that they ''cannot'' concur. That is to say, they are independent unless we know for certain that there is, in fact, an invariable connection between them. "The simple events, ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', will be said to be ''conditioned'' when they are not free to occur in every possible combination; in other words, when some compound event depending upon them is precluded from occurring. ... Simple unconditioned events are by definition independent." (1) In fact as long as ''xz'' is ''possible'', ''x'' and ''z'' are independent. This is plainly inconsistent with Boole's first definition, with which he makes no attempt to reconcile it. The consequences of his employing the term independence in a double sense are far-reaching. For he uses a method of reduction which is only valid when the arguments to which it is applied are independent in the first sense and assumes that it is valid if they are independent in the second sense. While his theorems are true if all propositions or events involved are independent in the first sense, they are not true, as he supposes them to be, if the events are independent only in the second sense."</ref> In his book ''The Last Challenge Problem'', David Miller provides a general method in accord with Boole's system and attempts to solve the problems recognised earlier by Keynes and others. Theodore Hailperin showed much earlier that Boole had used the correct mathematical definition of independence in his worked out problems.<ref name=Miller>{{cite web|url=http://zeteticgleanings.com/boole.html|title=ZETETIC GLEANINGS|access-date=10 March 2009|archive-date=18 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718152811/http://zeteticgleanings.com/boole.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Boole's work and that of later logicians initially appeared to have no engineering uses. [[Claude Shannon]] attended a philosophy class at the [[University of Michigan]] which introduced him to Boole's studies. Shannon recognised that Boole's work could form the basis of mechanisms and processes in the real world and that it was therefore highly relevant. In 1937 Shannon went on to write a master's thesis, at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], in which he showed how Boolean algebra could optimise the design of systems of electromechanical [[relay]]s then used in telephone routing switches. He also proved that circuits with relays could solve Boolean algebra problems. Employing the properties of electrical switches to process logic is the basic concept that underlies all modern electronic [[digital computer]]s. [[Victor Shestakov]] at Moscow State University (1907–1987) proposed a theory of electric switches based on Boolean logic even earlier than [[Claude Shannon]] in 1935 on the testimony of Soviet logicians and mathematicians [[Sofya Yanovskaya]], Gaaze-Rapoport, [[Roland Dobrushin]], Lupanov, Medvedev and Uspensky. But the first publication of Shestakov's result took place only in 1941 (in Russian). Hence, Boolean algebra became the foundation of practical [[digital circuit]] design; and Boole, via Shannon and Shestakov, provided the theoretical grounding for the [[Information Age]].<ref>"That dissertation has since been hailed as one of the most significant master's theses of the 20th century. To all intents and purposes, its use of binary code and Boolean algebra paved the way for the digital circuitry that is crucial to the operation of modern computers and telecommunications equipment."{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2001/mar/08/obituaries.news |newspaper=The Guardian |location=United Kingdom |date=8 March 2001 |title=Claude Shannon|first=Andrew|last=Emerson |access-date=14 December 2016 |archive-date=10 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410141635/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2001/mar/08/obituaries.news |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Clear}}

The work contains some remarks on the relationship of logic to religion, but they are slight and cryptic.<ref>Grattan-Guinness and Bornet, p. 16; [https://books.google.com/books?id=pzg7UFsIVJIC&pg=PR16 Google Books] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508164733/https://books.google.com/books?id=pzg7UFsIVJIC&pg=PR16 |date=8 May 2016 }}.</ref> Boole was apparently disconcerted at the book's reception just as a mathematical toolset:
<blockquote>George afterwards learned, to his great joy, that the same conception of the basis of Logic was held by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], the contemporary of Newton. De Morgan, of course, understood the formula in its true sense; he was Boole's collaborator all along. Herbert Spencer, Jowett, and [[Robert Leslie Ellis]] understood, I feel sure; and a few others, but nearly all the logicians and mathematicians ignored [953] the statement that the book was meant to throw light on the nature of the human mind; and treated the formula entirely as a wonderful new method of reducing to logical order masses of evidence about external fact.<ref name=MaryBoole/></blockquote>

Mary Boole claimed that there was profound influence – via her uncle [[George Everest]] – of [[India]]n thought in general and [[Indian logic]], in particular, on George Boole, as well as on [[Augustus De Morgan]] and [[Charles Babbage]]:<ref>Kak, S. (2018) George Boole’s Laws of Thought and Indian logic. Current Science, vol. 114, 2570–2573</ref>
<blockquote>Think what must have been the effect of the intense Hinduizing of three such men as Babbage, De Morgan, and George Boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 1830–65. What share had it in generating the [[Vector Analysis]] and the mathematics by which investigations in physical science are now conducted?<ref name=MaryBoole/></blockquote>

Boole maintained that:{{Blockquote|text= No general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognise, not only the special numerical bases of the science, but also those universal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning, and which, whatever they may be as to their essence, are at least mathematical as to their form.<ref name="Boole Studies in Logic p 273">{{cite book

==Family==
In 1855, Boole married [[Mary Everest Boole|Mary Everest]] (niece of [[George Everest]]), who later wrote several educational works on her husband's principles.

The Booles had five daughters:
