'''Francis Rory Peregrine''' "'''Perry'''" '''Anderson''' (born 11 September 1938) is a British intellectual, political philosopher, historian and essayist. His work ranges across historical sociology, intellectual history, and cultural analysis. What unites Anderson's work is a preoccupation with [[Western Marxism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}}

Anderson is perhaps best known as the moving force behind the ''[[New Left Review]]''. He is Professor of History and Sociology at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). Anderson has written many books, most recently ''Brazil Apart: 1964-2019'' and ''The H-Word: The Peripeteia of Hegemony''. He is the brother of political scientist [[Benedict Anderson]] (1936–2015).

== Career ==
In 1962 Anderson became editor of the ''[[New Left Review]]'', a position he held for twenty years.<ref name=Blackwell/> As scholars of the [[New Left]] began to reassess their [[canon (basic principle)|canon]] in the mid-1970s, Anderson provided an influential perspective.<ref name=Blackwell>{{Cite book |title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Historians |last=Parker |first=David |editor=Cannon, John |editor-link=John Cannon (historian) |year=1988 |publisher=Basil Blackwell Ltd. |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=063114708X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackwelldiction0000unse_u4p6/page/8 8–9] |url=https://archive.org/details/blackwelldiction0000unse_u4p6/page/8 }}</ref> He published two major volumes of analytical history in 1974: ''[[Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism]]'' focuses on the creation and endurance of [[Feudalism|feudal social formations]], while ''[[Lineages of the Absolutist State]]'' examines [[Absolute monarchy|monarchical absolutism]]. Within their respective topics they are each vast in scope, assessing the whole history of Europe from classical times to the nineteenth century. The books achieved an instant prominence for Anderson, whose wide-ranging analysis [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]]ed elements of history, philosophy, and [[political theory]].<ref name=Blackwell/>

In the 1980s, Anderson took office as a professor at the [[New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City|New York]].<ref name=Blackwell/> He returned as editor at ''NLR'' in 2000 for three more years, and after his retirement continued to serve on the journal's editorial committee. As of 2019, he has continued to make contributions to the ''[[London Review of Books]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/perry-anderson |title=Perry Anderson in the LRB Archive |author=London Review of Books |year=2012 |publisher=LRB Ltd. |access-date=29 May 2012 }}</ref> and pursued teaching as a Distinguished Professor of History and Sociology at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.ucla.edu/people/faculty?lid=252 |title=Perry R.

== Influence and criticism ==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2021}}
Anderson bore the brunt of the disapproval of [[E. P. Thompson]] in the latter's ''The Poverty of Theory'', in a controversy during the late 1970s over the [[structuralist Marxism]] of [[Louis Althusser]], and the use of history and theory in the politics of the Left. In the mid-1960s, Thompson wrote an essay for the annual ''[[Socialist Register]]'' that rejected Anderson's view of [[aristocratic]] dominance of Britain's historical trajectory, as well as Anderson's seeming preference for continental European theorists over radical British traditions and [[empiricism]]. Anderson delivered two responses to Thompson's [[polemics]], first in an essay in ''New Left Review'' (January–February 1966) called "Socialism and Pseudo-Empiricism",<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Anderson | first = Perry | title = Socialism and pseudo-empiricism | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = I | issue = 35 | pages = 2–42 | publisher = New Left Review | date = January–February 1966 | url = http://newleftreview.org/I/35/perry-anderson-socialism-and-pseudo-empiricism }}</ref> and then in a more conciliatory yet ambitious overview, ''Arguments within English Marxism'' (1980).

While Anderson faced many attacks in his native Britain for favouring continental European philosophers over British thinkers, he did not spare [[Western Marxism|Western European Marxists]] from criticism, such as in his ''Considerations on Western Marxism'' (1976). Nevertheless, many of his assaults were delivered against [[postmodernist]] currents in continental Europe. In his book ''In the Tracks of Historical Materialism'', Anderson depicts Paris as the new capital of intellectual reaction.
