{{Marxism}}
'''Raya Dunayevskaya''' (born '''Raya Shpigel''', {{lang|ru|Ра́я Шпи́гель}}; May 1, 1910 – June 9, 1987), later '''Rae Spiegel''', also known by the pseudonym '''Freddie Forest''', was the [[United States|American]] founder of the [[philosophy]] of [[Marxist humanism]] in the United States. At one time [[Leon Trotsky]]'s secretary, she later split with him and ultimately founded the organization [[News and Letters Committees]] and was its leader until her death.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=June 13, 1987 |title=Raya Dunayevskaya Is Dead; Author Was Aide to Trotsky |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/13/obituaries/raya-dunayevskaya-is-dead-author-was-aide-to-trotsky.html |journal=The New York Times}}</ref>

==Background==
Of [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] descent, Dunayevskaya was born Raya Shpigel in the [[Podolia Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]) and emigrated to the United States in 1922 (her name changed to Rae Spiegel) and joined the revolutionary movement in her childhood.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Raya Dunayevskaya Internet Archive |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/dunayevskaya/index.htm |access-date=2024-10-29 |website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>

==Career==
===Trotskyism===
Active in the American Communist Party youth organization, she was expelled at age 18 and thrown down a flight of stairs when she suggested that her local comrades should find out Trotsky's response to his [[Leon Trotsky#Defeat and exile (1927–1928)|expulsion]] from the [[Soviet Communist Party]] and the [[Comintern]]. By the following year she found a group of independent Trotskyists in [[Boston]], led by [[Antoinette Buchholz Konikow]], an advocate of [[birth control]] and legal [[abortion]].<ref name="Women Building Chicago">{{cite book|title=Women Building Chicago 1790-1990: A Biographical Dictionary |chapter=Dunayevskaya, Raya |author-first=Terry |author-last=Moon |editor-first1=Rima Lunin |editor-last1=Schultz |editor-first2=Adele |editor-last2=Hast |date=2001 |location=Bloomington |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |pages=238–241 |isbn=9780253338525}}</ref> In the 1930s, she adopted her mother's maiden name Dunayevskaya.<ref>{{cite book|author-first=Frank |author-last=Rosengarten |title=Urbane Revolutionary: C. L. R. James and the Struggle for a New Society |pages=65 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |date=2008}}</ref>

Without getting permission from the U.S. Trotskyist organization, she went to [[Mexico]] in 1937 to serve as [[Leon Trotsky]]'s Russian language secretary during his [[exile]] there.<ref name="Women Building Chicago" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Who is Raya Dunayevskaya? |url=http://newsandletters.org/raya-dunayevskaya/ |access-date=2024-10-29 |website=News and Letters Committees |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Independent===
Having returned to Chicago in 1938 after the deaths of her father and brother, she broke with Trotsky in 1939 when he continued to maintain that the [[Soviet Union]] was a "[[workers' state]]" even after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. She opposed any notion that workers should be asked to defend this "workers' state" allied with [[Nazi Germany]] in a [[world war]]. Along with theorists such as [[C. L. R. James]], and later [[Tony Cliff]], Dunayevskaya argued that the Soviet Union had become "[[state capitalist]]". Toward the end of her life, she stated that what she called "my real development" only began after her break with Trotsky.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Marxist-Humanism, an Interview with Raya Dunayevskaya |magazine=[[Chicago Literary Review]] |pages=16 |date=15 March 1985}}</ref>

Her simultaneous study of the Russian economy and of Marx's early writings (later known as the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''), led to her theory that not only was the [[U.S.S.R.]] a "[[state capitalist]]" society, but that '[[state capitalism]]' was a new world stage. Much of her initial analysis was published in ''The New International'' in 1942–1943.

=== Workers Party ===
In 1940, she was involved in the split in the [[Socialist Workers Party (US)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) that led to the formation of the [[Workers Party (US)|Workers Party]] (WP), with which she shared an objection to Trotsky's characterisation of the Soviet Union as a '[[degenerated workers' state]]'. Within the WP, she formed the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency]] alongside [[C. L. R. James]] (she being "Freddie Forest" and he "J.R. Johnson", named for their party cadre names). The tendency argued that the Soviet Union was "[[state capitalism|state capitalist]]", while the WP majority maintained that it was [[bureaucratic collectivist]].

=== Socialist Workers Party===
Differences within the WP steadily widened, and in 1947, after a brief period of independent existence during which they published a series of documents, the tendency returned to the ranks of the SWP. Their membership in the SWP was based on a shared insistence that there was a pre-revolutionary situation just around the corner, and the shared belief that a [[Leninist]] party must be in place to take advantage of the coming opportunities.

By 1951, with the failure of their shared perspective to materialize, the tendency developed a theory that rejected [[Leninism]] and saw the workers as being spontaneously revolutionary. This was borne out for them by the 1949 U.S. miners' strike. In later years, they were to pay close attention to [[automation]], especially in the [[automobile industry]], which they came to see as paradigmatic of a new stage of [[capitalism]]. This led to the tendency leaving the SWP again to begin independent work.

After more than a decade of developing the theory of [[state capitalism]], Dunayevskaya continued her study of the Hegelian [[dialectic]] by taking on a task the Johnson–Forest Tendency had set itself: exploring [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] ''[[Phanomenologie Des Geistes]]''. In 1954 she initiated a decades long correspondence with the critical theorist [[Herbert Marcuse]], in which the necessity and freedom dialectic in Hegel and Marx became a focal point of contention. She advanced an interpretation of Hegel's [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolutes]] holding that they involved a dual movement: a movement from practice that is itself a form of theory and a movement from theory reaching to philosophy. She considered these 1953 letters to be "the philosophic moment" from which the whole development of [[Marxist Humanism]] flowed.

=== News and Letters Committees===
In 1953 Dunayevskaya moved to Detroit, where she was to live until 1984. In 1954–1955 she and C. L. R. James engaged in a split{{clarify|date=December 2014}}. In 1955, she founded her own organization, [[News and Letters Committees]], and a Marxist-Humanist newspaper, ''News & Letters'', which remains in publication today. The newspaper covers women's struggles, the liberation of workers, people of color, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual rights and the disability rights movement, while not separating that coverage from philosophical and theoretical articles. The organization split in 2008-2009 and the U.S. Marxist-Humanists (later to become the [http://www.internationalmarxisthumanist.org/ International Marxist-Humanist Organization]) was formed.

Dunayevskaya wrote what came to be known as her "trilogy of revolution": ''[[Marxism and Freedom: From 1776 Until Today]]'' (1958), ''[[Philosophy and Revolution]]'' (1973), and ''[[Rosa Luxemburg, Women's Liberation, and Marx's Philosophy of Revolution]]'' (1982). In addition, she selected and introduced a collection of writings, published in 1985, ''Women's Liberation and the Dialectics of Revolution''.

In the last year of her life she was working on a new book which she had tentatively titled, ''Dialectics of Organization and Philosophy: The 'Party' and Forms of Organization Born Out of Spontaneity''.<ref>Many of her writings that were part of the process of work on the projected book are included in Volume XIII of the Supplement to the Raya Dunayevskaya Collection.</ref>
