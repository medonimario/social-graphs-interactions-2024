==Biography==
Saussure was born in [[Geneva]] in 1857. His father, [[Henri Louis Frédéric de Saussure]], was a [[mineralogist]], [[entomologist]], and [[taxonomist]]. Saussure showed signs of considerable talent and intellectual ability as early as the age of fourteen.<ref name="sljusareva-1972">Слюсарева, Наталья Александровна: ''Некоторые полузабытые страницы из истории языкознания – Ф. де Соссюр и У. Уитней.'' (Общее и романское языкознание: К 60-летию Р.А. Будагова). Москва 1972.</ref> In the autumn of 1870, he began attending the private school called the Institution Martine (previously the Institution Lecoultre until 1969) in Geneva.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Joseph |first=John E. |title=Saussure |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-19-969565-2 |location=Oxford |pages=120 |language=en}}</ref> There he lived with the family of a classmate, Elie David.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dFW34Ir-aKAC&q=%22institution+martine%22&pg=PA120|title=Saussure|last=Joseph|first=John E.|date=22 March 2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199695652|language=en}}</ref> After graduating at the top of class,<ref name=":2" /> Saussure expected to continue his studies at the Gymnase de Genève, but his father decided he was not mature enough at fourteen and a half, and sent him to the Collège de Genève instead. The college also housed the Gymnase de Genève and some of its teachers also taught at the Collège.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Leer |first=Martin |title=Economies of English |last2=Puskás |first2=Genoveva |publisher=Narr Francke Attempto Verlag |year=2016 |isbn=978-3-8233-8067-2 |location=Tubingen |pages=40 |language=en}}</ref> Saussure, however, was not pleased, as he complained: "I entered the Collège de Genève, to waste a year there as completely as a year can be wasted."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu6xCK_EFlcC&pg=PA129|title=Saussure|last=Joseph|first=John E.|date=22 March 2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191636974|language=en}}</ref>

He spent the year studying [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Sanskrit]] and taking a variety of courses at the [[University of Geneva]]. He also purposely avoided taking the course in general linguistics due to its bad reputation, arranging instead to study foundational works in comparative-historical linguistics with Louis Morel, a ''[[Privatdozent]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Chang |first=Ku-Ming |title=History of Universities: Volume XXXIV/1 |last2=Rocke |first2=Alan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2021 |isbn=978-0-19-284477-4 |location=Oxford, UK |pages=161 |language=en}}</ref> He commenced graduate work at the [[University of Leipzig]] and arrived at the university in October 1876.<ref name=":0" />

Two years later, at 21, Saussure published a book entitled ''Mémoire sur le système primitif des voyelles dans les langues indo-européennes'' (''Dissertation on the Primitive Vowel System in Indo-European Languages''). After this, he studied for a year at the [[University of Berlin]] under the ''[[Privatdozent]]'' [[Heinrich Zimmer (Celticist)|Heinrich Zimmer]], with whom he studied Celtic and [[Hermann Oldenberg]] with whom he continued his studies of Sanskrit.<ref>Joseph (2012:253)</ref> He returned to Leipzig to defend his doctoral dissertation ''De l'emploi du génitif absolu en Sanscrit'', and was awarded his doctorate in February 1880. Soon, he relocated to the [[University of Paris]], where he lectured on Sanskrit, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old High German]], and occasionally other subjects.

Ferdinand de Saussure is one of the world's most quoted linguists, which is remarkable as he hardly published anything during his lifetime. Even his few scientific articles are not unproblematic. Thus, for example, his publication on Lithuanian phonetics<ref>Ferdinand de Saussure, « Aaccentuation lituanienne ». In : Indogermanische Forschungen. Vol. 6, 157 – 166</ref> is mostly taken from studies by the Lithuanian researcher [[Friedrich Kurschat]], with whom Saussure traveled through Lithuania in August 1880 for two weeks and whose (German) books Saussure had read.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mpbAAAAQAAJ&q=Kurschat|title=Beiträge zur Kunde der littauischen Sprache.

Königsberg 1849|last=Kurschat|first=Friedrich|origyear=1843|year= 1858}}</ref> Saussure, who had studied some basic grammar of Lithuanian in Leipzig for one semester but was unable to speak the language, was thus dependent on Kurschat.

Saussure taught at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] for eleven years during which he was named Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur (Knight of the [[Legion of Honor]]).<ref>Culler (1976:23)</ref> When offered a professorship in Geneva in 1892, he returned to Switzerland. Saussure lectured on Sanskrit and Indo-European at the [[University of Geneva]] for the remainder of his life. It was not until 1907 that Saussure began teaching the Course of General Linguistics, which he would offer three times, ending in the summer of 1911. He died in 1913 in [[Vufflens-le-Château]], [[Vaud]], Switzerland. His brothers were the linguist and Esperantist [[René de Saussure]], and scholar of ancient Chinese astronomy, [[Léopold de Saussure]]. His son [[Raymond de Saussure]] was a psychiatrist and prolific psychoanalytic theorist, who was trained under [[Sigmund Freud]] himself.<ref>H. Vermorel, 'Raymond de Saussure. First president of the European Psychoanalytical Federation', ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'' 79:1 (February 1998), pp.73–81</ref>

Saussure attempted, at various times in the 1880s and 1890s, to write a book on general linguistic matters. His lectures about important principles of language description in Geneva between 1907 and 1911 were collected and published by his pupils posthumously in the famous ''[[Cours de linguistique générale]]'' in 1916. Work published in his lifetime includes two monographs and a few dozen papers and notes, all of them collected in a volume of some 600 pages published in 1922.<ref>''Recueil des publications scientifiques de F. de Saussure'' (1922), ed. C. Bally and L. Gautier, Lausanne and Geneva: Payot.</ref> Saussure did not publish anything of his work on ancient poetics even though he had filled more than a hundred notebooks. [[Jean Starobinski]] edited and presented material from them in the 1970s<ref>Jean Starobinski, ''Les mots sous les mots. Les anagrammes de Ferdinand de Saussure'', Paris, Gallimard, 1971,</ref> and more has been published since then.<ref>''Anagrammes homériques'', édition Pierre-Yves Testenoire, Limoges, Lambert Lucas, 2013.</ref> Some of his manuscripts, including an unfinished essay discovered in 1996, were published in ''Writings in General Linguistics'', but most of the material in it had already been published in Engler's critical edition of the ''Course'', in 1967 and 1974. Today it is clear that ''Cours'' owes much to its so-called editors Charles Bally and Albert Sèchehaye and various details are difficult to track to Saussure himself or his manuscripts.<ref>Jürgen Trabant, « Saussure contre le Cours ». In: Francois Rastier (Hrsg.): De l'essence double du langage et le renouveau du saussurisme. Limoges: Lambert-Lucas. {{ISBN|978-2-35935-160-6}}</ref>

==Work and influence==
Saussure's theoretical reconstructions of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] vocalic system and particularly his [[laryngeal theory|theory of laryngeals]], otherwise unattested at the time, bore fruit and found confirmation after the decipherment of [[Hittite language|Hittite]] in the work of later generations of linguists such as [[Émile Benveniste]] and [[Walter Couvreur]], who both drew direct inspiration from their reading of the 1878 ''Mémoire''.<ref>[[E. F. K. Koerner]], 'The Place of Saussure's Memoire in the development of historical linguistics,' in Jacek Fisiak (ed.) ''Papers from the Sixth International Conference on Historical Linguistics,'' (Poznań, Poland, 1983) John Benjamins Publishing, 1985 pp.323-346, p.339.</ref>

Saussure had a major impact on the development of linguistic theory in the first half of the 20th century with his notions becoming incorporated in the central tenets of [[structuralism|structural linguistics]]. His main contributions to structuralism include his notion of the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jensen |first=Klaus Bruhn |title=A Handbook of Media and Communication Research: Qualitative and Quantitative Methodologies |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-22514-0 |location=London |pages=25 |language=en}}</ref> There is also his theory of a two-tiered reality about language. The first is the ''langue'', the abstract and invisible layer, while the second, the ''parole'', refers to the actual speech that we hear in real life.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Michel Foucault|last=Fendler|first=Lynn|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2010|isbn=9781472518811|location=London|pages=17}}</ref> This framework was later adopted by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Claude Levi-Strauss]], who used the two-tiered model to determine the reality of myths. His idea was that all myths have an underlying pattern, which forms the structure that makes them myths.<ref name=":1" />

In Europe, the most important work after Saussure's death was done by the [[Prague school]]. Most notably, [[Nikolay Trubetzkoy]] and [[Roman Jakobson]] headed the efforts of the Prague School in setting the course of [[phonology|phonological theory]] in the decades from 1940. Jakobson's universalizing structural-functional theory of phonology, based on a [[markedness]] hierarchy of [[distinctive features]], was the first successful solution of a plane of linguistic analysis according to the Saussurean hypotheses. Elsewhere, [[Louis Hjelmslev]] and [[the Copenhagen school (linguistics)|the Copenhagen School]] proposed new interpretations of linguistics from structuralist theoretical frameworks.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

In America, where the term 'structuralism' became highly ambiguous, Saussure's ideas informed the [[distributionalism]] of [[Leonard Bloomfield]], but his influence remained limited.<ref>{{cite book| author = John Earl Joseph| title = From Whitney to Chomsky: Essays in the History Of American Linguisitcs| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RUvdfiILAngC&pg=PA139| year = 2002| publisher = John Benjamins Publishing| isbn = 978-90-272-4592-2| page = 139 }}</ref><ref name="Seuren_2006">{{cite book |last1=Seuren|first1=Pieter|editor-last= Auroux|editor-first=Sylvain |title= History of the Language Sciences: An International Handbook on the Evolution of the Study of Language from the Beginnings to the Present |publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=2008 |pages=2026–2034 |chapter=Early formalization tendencies in 20th-century American linguistics |isbn=9783110199826 | url=https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_59380/component/file_1694788/content |access-date=6 July 2020}}</ref> [[Systemic functional linguistics]] is a theory considered to be based firmly on the Saussurean principles of the sign, albeit with some modifications. [[Ruqaiya Hasan]] describes [[systemic functional linguistics]] as a 'post-Saussurean' linguistic theory. [[Michael Halliday]] argues:

{{Blockquote|Saussure took the sign as the organizing concept for linguistic structure, using it to express the conventional nature of language in the phrase "l'arbitraire du signe". This has the effect of highlighting what is, in fact, the one point of arbitrariness in the system, namely the phonological shape of words, and hence allows the non-arbitrariness of the rest to emerge with greater clarity. An example of something that is distinctly non-arbitrary is the way different kinds of meaning in language are expressed by different kinds of grammatical structure, as appears when linguistic structure is interpreted in functional terms<ref>Halliday, MAK. 1977. Ideas about Language. Reprinted in Volume 3 of MAK Halliday's Collected Works. Edited by J.J. Webster. London: Continuum. p113.</ref>}}

===''Course in General Linguistics''===
{{Main|Course in General Linguistics}}

Saussure's most influential work, ''Course in General Linguistics'' (''Cours de linguistique générale''), was published posthumously in 1916 by former students [[Charles Bally]] and [[Albert Sechehaye]], based on notes taken from Saussure's lectures in Geneva.<ref>Macey, D. (2009). The Penguin dictionary of critical theory. Crane Library at the University of British Columbia.</ref> The ''Course'' became one of the [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] linguistics works of the 20th century not primarily for the content (many of the ideas had been anticipated in the works of other 20th-century linguists) but for the innovative approach that Saussure applied in discussing linguistic phenomena.

Its central notion is that language may be analyzed as a [[formal system]] of differential elements, apart from the messy dialectics of real-time production and comprehension. Examples of these elements include his notion of the [[sign (linguistics)|linguistic sign]], which is composed of the signifier and the signified. Though the sign may also have a referent, Saussure took that to lie beyond the linguist's purview.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Chandler |first=Daniel |title=Semiotics: The Basics |publisher=Routledge |year=2022 |isbn=978-1-000-56294-1 |location=Oxon |language=en}}</ref>

Throughout the book, he stated that a linguist can develop a diachronic analysis of a text or theory of language but must learn just as much or more about the language/text as it exists at any moment in time (i.e. "synchronically"): "Language is a system of signs that expresses ideas". A science that studies the life of signs within society and is a part of social and general psychology. Saussure believed that semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign, and he called it semiology.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Semiotics for Beginners: Signs |url=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/courses/BIB/semio2.htm |access-date=5 May 2022 |website=www.cs.princeton.edu}}</ref>

===Laryngeal theory===
{{main|Laryngeal theory}}
While a student, Saussure published an important work about [[Proto-Indo-European]], which explained unusual forms of word roots in terms of lost phonemes he called ''sonant coefficients''. The Scandinavian scholar [[Hermann Möller]] suggested that they might be laryngeal consonants, leading to what is now known as the laryngeal theory. After [[Hittite texts]] were discovered and deciphered, Polish linguist [[Jerzy Kuryłowicz]] recognized that a Hittite consonant stood in the positions where Saussure had theorized a lost phoneme some 48 years earlier, confirming the theory. It has been argued{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} that Saussure's work on this problem, systematizing the irregular word forms by hypothesizing then-unknown phonemes, stimulated his development of [[structuralism]].

===Influence outside linguistics===
The principles and methods employed by structuralism were later adapted in diverse fields by French intellectuals such as [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. Such scholars took influence from Saussure's ideas in their areas of study (literary studies/philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropology, etc.).{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

==View of language==

Saussure approaches [[theory of language|the theory of language]] from two different perspectives. On the one hand, language is a system of signs. That is, a semiotic system; or a semiological system as he calls it. On the other hand, a language is also a social phenomenon: a product of the language community.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Martin |first=Bronwen |title=Key Terms in Semiotics |date=2006-06-02 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=978-0-8264-8456-7 |location=New York, NY |pages=3 |language=en}}</ref>

===Language as semiology===

====The bilateral sign====

One of Saussure's key contributions to semiotics lies in what he called ''semiology'', the concept of the bilateral (two-sided) sign which consists of 'the signifier' (a linguistic form, e.g. a word) and 'the signified' (the meaning of the form). Saussure supported the argument for the arbitrariness of the sign although he did not deny the fact that some words are [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]], or claim that picture-like symbols are fully arbitrary. Saussure also did not consider the linguistic sign as random, but as historically cemented.{{efn|1959 translation, p. 68–69}} All in all, he did not invent the philosophy of arbitrariness but made a very influential contribution to it.<ref name="Nöth_1990">{{cite book|last=Nöth|first=Winfried|url=https://salahlibrary.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/handbook-of-semiotics.pdf|title=Handbook of Semiotics|date=1990|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20959-7|author-link=Winfried Nöth|access-date=24 September 2020|archive-date=8 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308052018/https://salahlibrary.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/handbook-of-semiotics.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The arbitrariness of words of different languages itself is a fundamental concept in Western thinking of language, dating back to Ancient Greek philosophers.<ref name="Hutton_1989">{{cite journal |last=Hutton|first=Christopher |date=1989 |title=The arbitrary nature of the sign |journal=Semiotica|volume=75 |issue=1–2 |pages=63–78 |doi=10.1515/semi.1989.75.1-2.63|s2cid=170807245 }}</ref> The question of whether words are natural or arbitrary (and artificially made by people) returned as a controversial topic during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] when the medieval [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] dogma, that languages were created by God, became opposed by the advocates of [[Humanism|humanistic]] philosophy. There were efforts to construct a 'universal language', based on the lost [[Adamic language]], with various attempts to uncover universal words or characters which would be readily understood by all people regardless of their nationality. [[John Locke]], on the other hand, was among those who believed that languages were a rational human innovation,<ref name="Jermołowicz_2003">{{cite journal |last=Jermołowicz|first=Renata |date=2003 |title=On the project of a universal language in the framework of the XVII century philosophy |url=http://logika.uwb.edu.pl/studies/download.php?volid=19&artid=rj&format=PDF |journal=Studies in Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric|volume=6 |issue=19 |pages=51–61 |isbn=83-89031-75-2|access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref> and argued for the arbitrariness of words.<ref name="Hutton_1989" />

Saussure took it for granted in his time that "No one disputes the principle of the arbitrary nature of the sign."{{efn|p. 68}} He however disagreed with the common notion that each word corresponds "to the thing that it names" or what is called the [[referent]] in modern semiotics. For example, in Saussure's notion, the word 'tree' does not refer to a tree as a physical object, but to the psychological ''concept'' of a tree. The linguistic sign thus arises from the psychological ''association'' between the signifier (a 'sound-image') and the signified (a 'concept'). There can therefore be no linguistic expression without meaning, but also no meaning without linguistic expression.{{efn|p. 65}} Saussure's structuralism, as it later became called, therefore includes an implication of [[linguistic relativity]]. However, Saussure's view has been described instead as a form of [[semantic holism]] that acknowledged that the interconnection between terms in a language was not fully arbitrary and only methodologically bracketed the relationship between linguistic terms and the physical world.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Josephson-Storm|first=Jason Ānanda|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1249473210|title=Metamodernism: the future of theory|date=2021|isbn=978-0-226-78679-7|location=Chicago|pages=153–5|oclc=1249473210}}</ref>

The naming of [[Spectral color|spectral colours]] exemplifies how meaning and expression arise simultaneously from their interlinkage. Different colour frequencies are per se meaningless, or mere ''substance'' or meaning potential. Likewise, [[Phoneme|phonemic]] combinations that are not associated with any content are only meaningless expression potential, and therefore not considered as ''signs''. It is only when a region of the spectrum is outlined and given an arbitrary name, for example, 'blue', that the sign emerges. The sign consists of the ''signifier'' ('blue') and the ''signified'' (the colour region), and of the associative link which connects them. Arising from an arbitrary demarcation of meaning potential, the signified is not a property of the physical world. In Saussure's concept, language is ultimately not a function of reality, but a self-contained system. Thus, Saussure's semiology entails a bilateral (two-sided) perspective of semiotics.

The same idea is applied to any concept. For example, natural law does not dictate which plants are 'trees' and which are 'shrubs' or a different type of [[woody plant]]; or whether these should be divided into further groups. Like blue, all signs gain semantic ''value'' in opposition to other signs of the system (e.g. red, colourless). If more signs emerge (e.g. 'marine blue'), the [[semantic field]] of the original word may narrow down. Conversely, words may become antiquated, whereby competition for the semantic field lessens. Or, the meaning of a word may change altogether.<ref name="Hjelmslev_1969">{{cite book|last=Hjelmslev|first=Louis|title=Prolegomena to a Theory of Language|date=1969|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299024709|author-link=Louis Hjelmslev|orig-year=First published 1943}}</ref>

After his death, [[Structural linguistics|structural]] and [[Functional linguistics|functional linguists]] applied Saussure's concept to the analysis of the linguistic form as motivated by meaning. The opposite direction of the linguistic expressions as giving rise to the conceptual system, on the other hand, became the foundation of the post-Second World War structuralists who adopted Saussure's concept of structural linguistics as the model for all human sciences as the study of how language shapes our concepts of the world. Thus, Saussure's model became important not only for linguistics but for [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] as a whole.<ref name="Dosse_1997-1">{{cite book |last=Dosse|first=François |title=History of Structuralism, Vol.1: The Rising Sign, 1945-1966 Present; translated by Edborah Glassman |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |date=1997 |orig-year=First published 1991| url=https://monoskop.org/images/0/03/Dosse_Francois_History_of_Structuralism_1_The_Rising_Sign_1945-1966.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200708172837/https://monoskop.org/images/0/03/Dosse_Francois_History_of_Structuralism_1_The_Rising_Sign_1945-1966.pdf |archive-date=2020-07-08 |url-status=live |isbn= 978-0-8166-2241-2}}</ref>

====Opposition theory====
{{See also|Binary opposition|Markedness|}}

A second key contribution comes from Saussure's notion of the organisation of language based on the principle of opposition. Saussure made a distinction between meaning (significance) and ''value''. On the semantic side, concepts gain value by being contrasted with related concepts, creating a conceptual system that could in modern terms be described as a [[semantic network]]. On the level of the sound-image, phonemes and morphemes gain value by being contrasted with related phonemes and morphemes; and on the level of the grammar, parts of speech gain value by being contrasted with each other.{{efn|Ch. III}} Each element within each system is eventually contrasted with all other elements in different types of relations so that no two elements have the same value:

:"Within the same language, all words used to express related ideas limit each other reciprocally; synonyms like French ''redouter'' 'dread', ''craindre'' 'fear,' and ''avoir peur'' 'be afraid' have value only through their opposition: if ''redouter'' did not exist, all its content would go to its competitors."{{efn|p. 116}}

Saussure defined his theory in terms of binary oppositions: ''sign—signified, meaning—value, language—speech, synchronic—diachronic, internal linguistics—external linguistics'', and so on. The related term [[markedness]] denotes the assessment of value between binary oppositions. These were studied extensively by post-war structuralists such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] to explain the organisation of social conceptualisation, and later by the [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] to criticise it.

Based on markedness theory, the Prague Linguistic Circle made great advances in the study of [[phonetics]] reforming it as the systemic study of [[phonology]]. Although the terms opposition and markedness are rightly associated with Saussure's concept of language as a semiological system, he did not invent the terms and concepts that had been discussed by various 19th-century grammarians before him.<ref name="Andersen_1989">{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Henning|editor-last=Tomic |editor-first=O.

===Language as a social phenomenon===
In his treatment of language as a 'social fact', Saussure touches on topics that were controversial in his time, and that would continue to split opinions in the post-war structuralist movement.<ref name="Dosse_1997-1" /> Saussure's relationship with 19th-century theories of language was somewhat ambivalent. These included social Darwinism and [[Völkerpsychologie]] or [[Volksgeist]] thinking which were regarded by many intellectuals as nationalist and racist [[pseudoscience]].<ref name="Klautke_2010">{{cite journal|last=Klautke|first=Egbert|date=2010|title=The mind of the nation: the debate about Völkerpsychologie|url=https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/19064/1/19064.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200313105431/https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/19064/1/19064.pdf |archive-date=2020-03-13 |url-status=live|journal=Central Europe|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1179/174582110X12676382921428|s2cid=14786272|access-date=8 July 2020}}</ref><ref name="Hejl 2013">{{cite book|last=Hejl|first=P.

Saussure, however, considered the ideas useful if treated properly. Instead of discarding August Schleicher's [[organicism]] or [[Heymann Steinthal]]'s "spirit of the nation", he restricted their sphere in ways that were meant to preclude any [[Chauvinism|chauvinistic]] interpretations.<ref name="Saussure_1959" /><ref name="Klautke_2010" />

'''Organic analogy'''

Saussure exploited the sociobiological concept of language as a living organism. He criticises August Schleicher and Max Müller's ideas of languages as organisms struggling for living space but settles with promoting the idea of linguistics as a natural science as long as the study of the 'organism' of language excludes its adaptation to its territory.<ref name="Saussure_1959" /> This concept would be modified in post-Saussurean linguistics by the Prague circle linguists [[Roman Jakobson]] and [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]],<ref name="Seriot_1999">{{cite book|author-last=Sériot|author-first=Patrick|title=Prague Linguistic Circle Papers, Vol. 3|publisher=John Benjamins|year=1999|isbn=9789027275066|editor-last1=Hajičová|pages=15–24|chapter=The Impact of Czech and Russian Biology on the Linguistic Thought of the Prague Linguistic Circle|editor-last2=Hoskovec|editor-last3=Leška|editor-last4=Sgall|editor-last5=Skoumalová}}</ref> and eventually diminished.<ref name="Andersen_2006">{{cite book|last=Andersen|first=Henning|title=Competing Models of Linguistic Change : Evolution and Beyond|date=2006|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=9789027293190|editor-last=Nedergaard|editor-first=Ole|pages=59–90|chapter=Synchrony, diachrony, and evolution}}</ref>

====The speech circuit====
{{Main|Langue and parole}}

Perhaps the most famous of Saussure's ideas is the distinction between language and speech ([[French language|Fr.]] ''langue et parole''), with 'speech' referring to the individual occurrences of language usage. These constitute two parts of three of Saussure's 'speech circuit' (''circuit de parole''). The third part is the brain, that is, the mind of the individual member of the language community.{{efn|p. Ch. 1.2}} This idea is in principle borrowed from Steinthal, so Saussure's concept of a language as a social fact corresponds to "Volksgeist", although he was careful to preclude any nationalistic interpretations. In Saussure's and Durkheim's thinking, social facts and norms do not elevate the individuals but shackle them.<ref name="Klautke_2010" /><ref name="Hejl 2013" /> Saussure's definition of language is statistical rather than idealised.

::"Among all the individuals that are linked together by speech, some sort of average will be set up : all will reproduce — not exactly of course, but approximately — the same signs united with the same concepts."{{efn|p. 13}}

Saussure argues that language is a 'social fact'; a conventionalised set of rules or norms relating to speech. When at least two people are engaged in conversation, there forms a communicative circuit between the minds of the individual speakers. Saussure explains that language, as a social system, is neither situated in ''speech'' nor the mind. It only properly exists between the two within the loop. It is located in – and is the product of – the collective mind of the linguistic group.{{efn|p. 5}} An individual has to learn the normative rules of language and can never control them.{{efn|p. 14}}

The task of the linguist is to study the language by analysing samples of speech. For practical reasons, this is ordinarily the analysis of written texts.{{efn|p. 6}} The idea that language is studied through texts is by no means revolutionary as it had been the common practice since the beginning of linguistics. Saussure does not advise against [[introspection]] and takes up many linguistic examples without reference to a source in a [[text corpus]].<ref name="Saussure_1959">{{cite book |last=de Saussure |first=Ferdinand |title=Course in general linguistics |place=New York |publisher=Philosophy Library |date=1959 |orig-year=First published 1916 |url=https://monoskop.org/images/0/0b/Saussure_Ferdinand_de_Course_in_General_Linguistics_1959.pdf |isbn=9780231157278 |author-link=Ferdinand de Saussure |access-date=25 May 2020 |archive-date=14 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200414113626/https://monoskop.org/images/0/0b/Saussure_Ferdinand_de_Course_in_General_Linguistics_1959.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> The idea that linguistics is not the study of the mind, however, contradicts [[Wilhelm Wundt]]'s Völkerpsychologie in Saussure's contemporary context; and in a later context, [[generative grammar]] and [[cognitive linguistics]].<ref name="Caron_2006">{{cite book |last=Caron |first=Jean|editor-last=Auroux |editor-first=Sylvain |title=History of the Language Sciences, Vol. 3 |publisher=De Gruyter |date=2006 |pages=2637–2649 |chapter=La linguistique et la psychologie I: Le rapport entre le langage et la pensée au XXe siècle |isbn= 9783110167368 }}</ref>

==A legacy of ideological disputes==

===Structuralism versus generative grammar===

Saussure's influence was restricted to American linguistics which was dominated by the advocates of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]'s [[Structuralism (psychology)|psychological approach]] to language, especially [[Leonard Bloomfield]] (1887–1949).<ref name="Joseph_2002">{{cite book |last=Joseph |first=John E. |year=2002| title=From Whitney to Chomsky: Essays in the History of American Linguistics |publisher=John Benjamins |isbn=9789027275370 }}</ref> The Bloomfieldian school rejected Saussure's and other structuralists' sociological or even anti-psychological (e.g. [[Louis Hjelmslev]], [[Lucien Tesnière]]) approaches to [[theory of language|the theory of language]]. Problematically, the post-Bloomfieldian school was nicknamed 'American structuralism', confusing.<ref name="Blevins_2013">{{cite book |last=Blevins|first=James P. |chapter=American Descriptivism ('Structuralism') |editor-last=Allan|editor-first=Keith |title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2013|pages=418–437 |doi= 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199585847.013.0019|isbn=978-0199585847 }}</ref> Although Bloomfield denounced Wundt's [[Völkerpsychologie]] and opted for [[behavioural psychology]] in his 1933 textbook ''Language'', he and other American linguists stuck to Wundt's practice of analysing the [[Object (grammar)|grammatical object]] as part of the [[verb phrase]]. Since this practice is not semantically motivated, they argued for the disconnectedness of syntax from semantics,<ref name="Seuren_1998">{{cite book|author=Seuren, Pieter A. M. |year=1998|title=Western linguistics: An historical introduction|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=0-631-20891-7|pages=160–167}}</ref> thus fully rejecting structuralism.

The question remained why the object should be in the verb phrase, vexing American linguists for decades.<ref name="Seuren_1998" /> The post-Bloomfieldian approach was eventually reformed as a sociobiological<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Steven |date=2002 |title=Sociobiology and you |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/sociobiology-and-you/ |journal=The Nation |issue=18 November |access-date=25 February 2020}}</ref> framework by [[Noam Chomsky]] who argued that linguistics is a [[cognitive science]]; and claimed that linguistic structures are the manifestation of a random [[mutation]] in the human [[genome]].<ref name="Berwick&Chomsky_2015">{{cite book |last1=Berwick|first1=Robert C. |last2=Chomsky|first2=Noam | title=Why Only Us: Language and Evolution|publisher=MIT Press |date=2015 |isbn=9780262034241}}</ref> Advocates of the new school, [[generative grammar]], claim that Saussure's structuralism has been reformed and replaced by Chomsky's modern approach to linguistics. [[Jan Koster]] asserts:

::it is certainly the case that Saussure considered the most important linguist of the century in Europe until the 1950s, hardly plays a role in current theoretical thinking about language. As a result of the Chomskyan revolution, linguistics has gone through a number of conceptual transformations which have led to all kinds of technical pre-occupations that are far beyond linguistic practice of the days of Saussure. For the most it seems Saussure has rightly sunk into near oblivion.<ref>Koster, Jan. 1996. "Saussure meets the brain", in R. Jonkers, E. Kaan, J. K. Wiegel, eds., Language and Cognition 5. Yearbook 1992 of the Research Group for Linguistic Theory and Knowledge Representation of the University of Groningen, Groningen, pp. 115–120.[http://www.let.rug.nl/koster/old%20papers/saussure.pdf PDF]</ref>

French historian and philosopher [[François Dosse]] however argues that there have been various misunderstandings. He points out that Chomsky's criticism of 'structuralism' is directed at the Bloomfieldian school and not the proper address of the term; and that structural linguistics is not to be reduced to mere sentence analysis.<ref name="Dosse_1997">{{cite book |last=Dosse|first=François |title=History of Structuralism, Vol.2: The Sign Sets, 1967- Present; translated by Edborah Glassman |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |date=1997 |orig-year=First published 1992| url=https://monoskop.org/images/6/6c/Dosse_Francois_History_of_Structuralism_2_The_Sign_Sets_1967-Present.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200616154628/https://monoskop.org/images/6/6c/Dosse_Francois_History_of_Structuralism_2_The_Sign_Sets_1967-Present.pdf |archive-date=2020-06-16 |url-status=live |isbn= 0-8166-2239-6}}</ref> It is also argued that

::"'Chomsky the Saussurean' is nothing but "an academic fable". This fable is a result of misreading – by Chomsky himself (1964) and also by others – of Saussure's ''la langue'' (in the singular form) as generativist concept of 'competence' and, therefore, its grammar as the Universal Grammar (UG)."<ref name="Shakeri_2017">{{cite journal |last=Shakeri |first=Mohammad Amin |date=2017 |title=General Grammar vs. Universal Grammar: an unbridgeable chasm between the Saussureans and Chomsky |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01773237 |journal=Le Cours de Linguistique Générale, 1916-2016. l'Émergence, Jan 2017, Genève, Switzerland. |series=Travaux des colloques.

===Saussure versus the social Darwinists===

Saussure's ''Course in General Linguistics'' begins{{efn|1959 translation, pp. 3–4}} and ends{{efn|pp. 231–232: "We now realize that Schleicher was wrong in looking upon language as an organic thing with its own law of evolution, but we continue, without suspecting it, to try to make language organic in another sense by assuming that the "genius" of a race or ethnic group tends constantly to lead language along certain fixed routes."}} with a criticism of 19th-century linguistics where he is especially critical of [[Geist#Volksgeist|Volkgeist]] thinking and the [[evolutionary linguistics]] of [[August Schleicher]] and his colleagues. Saussure's ideas replaced social Darwinism in Europe as it was banished from [[humanities]] at the end of World War II.<ref name="Aronoff_2017">{{cite book |last=Aronoff|first=Mark |editor-last1=Bowern | editor-last2=Horn | editor-last3=Zanuttini |title=On Looking into Words (and Beyond): Structures, Relations, Analyses|publisher=SUNY Press |year=2017|pages=443–456 |chapter=Darwinism tested by the science of language | url=https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/151| access-date=3 March 2020 |isbn= 978-3-946234-92-0}}</ref>

The publication of [[Richard Dawkins]]'s [[memetics]] in 1976 brought the Darwinian idea of linguistic units as cultural replicators back to vogue.<ref name="Frank_2008">{{cite book |last=Frank |first=Roslyn M. |date=2008|editor-last=Frank | title=Sociocultural Situatedness, Vol. 2| publisher=De Gruyter |chapter=The Language–organism–species analogy: a complex adaptive systems approach to shifting perspectives on "language" |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wdDZYp9KD2wC&pg=PA215 |pages=215–262 |isbn=978-3-11-019911-6 }}</ref> It became necessary for adherents of this movement to redefine linguistics in a way that would be simultaneously anti-Saussurean and anti-Chomskyan. This led to a redefinition of old humanistic terms such as structuralism, formalism, functionalism, and constructionism along Darwinian lines through debates that were marked by an acrimonious tone. In a functionalism–formalism debate of the decades following ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', the '[[Evolutionary linguistics#Functionalism (adaptationism)|functionalism]]' camp attacking Saussure's legacy includes frameworks such as [[Cognitive Linguistics]], [[Construction Grammar]], [[Usage-based linguistics]], and [[Emergent grammar|Emergent Linguistics]].<ref name="Darnell_1999">{{cite book |year=1999|editor-last1=Darnell|editor-last2=Moravcsik| editor-last3=Noonan | editor-last4=Newmeyer | editor-last5=Wheatley| title=Functionalism and Formalism in Linguistics, Vol. 1| publisher=John Benjamins |isbn=9789027298799 }}</ref><ref name="MacWhinney_2015">{{cite book |last=MacWhinney |first=Brian|editor-last1= MacWhinney |editor-first1=Brian |editor-last2= O'Grady |editor-first2=William|title=Handbook of Language Emergence |publisher=Wiley |date=2015 |pages=1–31 |chapter= Introduction – language emergence |isbn= 9781118346136 }}</ref> Arguing for 'functional-typological theory', [[William Croft (linguist)|William Croft]] criticises Saussure's use of the [[Organicism|organic analogy]]:

::When comparing functional-typological theory to biological theory, one must take care to avoid a caricature of the latter. In particular, in comparing the structure of language to an ecosystem, one must not assume that in contemporary biological theory, it is believed that an organism possesses a perfect adaptation to a stable niche inside an ecosystem in equilibrium. The analogy of a language as a perfectly adapted 'organic' system where ''tout se tient'' is a characteristic of the structuralist approach, and was prominent in early structuralist writing. The static view of adaptation in biology is not tenable in the face of empirical evidence of nonadaptive variation and competing adaptive motivations of organisms.<ref name="Croft_1993">{{cite journal |last=Croft |first=William |date=1993 |title=Functional-typological theory in its historical and intellectual context |journal=STUF - Language Typology and Universals |volume=46 |issue=1–4 |pages=15–26 |doi=10.1524/stuf.1993.46.14.15 |s2cid=170296028 }}</ref>

Structural linguist [[Henning Andersen (linguist)|Henning Andersen]] disagrees with Croft. He criticises memetics and other models of cultural evolution and points out that the concept of 'adaptation' is not to be taken in linguistics in the same meaning as in biology.<ref name="Andersen_2006" /> Humanistic and structuralistic notions are likewise defended by [[Esa Itkonen]]<ref name="Itkonen_1999">{{cite journal |last=Itkonen |first=Esa |year=1999 |title=Functionalism yes, biologism no |journal=Zeitschrift für Sprachwissenschaft |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=219–221 |doi=10.1515/zfsw.1999.18.2.219|s2cid=146998564 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Itkonen_2011">{{cite journal |last1= Itkonen|first1= Esa|date= 2011|title= On Coseriu's legacy|url= http://www.romling.uni-tuebingen.de/energeia/zeitschrift/2011/pdf/On_Coserius_legacy.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114133703/http://www.romling.uni-tuebingen.de/energeia/zeitschrift/2011/pdf/On_Coserius_legacy.pdf |archive-date=2020-01-14 |url-status=live|journal=Energeia |issue= III|pages= 1–29|doi= 10.55245/energeia.2011.001|s2cid= 247142924|access-date=14 January 2020 }}</ref> and Jacques François;<ref name="François_2018">{{cite book |last=François |first=Jacques|editor-last1=Sellami-Baklouti |editor-last2=Fontaine |title=Perspectives from Systemic Functional Linguistics |publisher=Routledge |date=2018 |pages=1–5 |chapter=The stance of Systemic Functional Linguistics amongst functional(ist) theories of language and its 'systemic' purpose |isbn= 9781315299846 }}</ref> the Saussurean standpoint is explained and defended by Tomáš Hoskovec, representing the [[Prague Linguistic Circle]].<ref name="Hoskovec_2017">{{cite journal |last=Hoskovec|first=Tomáš |date=2017 |title=Thèses de Prague 2016 |url=http://www.revue-texto.net/docannexe/file/3842/les_theses_de_prague_2016_hoskovec.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630110859/http://www.revue-texto.net/docannexe/file/3842/les_theses_de_prague_2016_hoskovec.pdf |archive-date=2017-06-30 |url-status=live |journal=Teksto!|volume=XXII |issue=1 |access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref>
