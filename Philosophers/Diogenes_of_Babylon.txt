{{For|the Epicurean philosopher, also from Seleucia|Diogenes of Seleucia}}
'''Diogenes of Babylon''' (also known as '''Diogenes of Seleucia'''; {{lang-grc-gre|Διογένης Βαβυλώνιος}}; {{langx|la|Diogenes Babylonius}}; c. 230 – c. 150/140 BC{{sfn|Dorandi|1999|pp=50–51}}) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher. He was the [[scholarch|head]] of the Stoic school in [[Athens]], and he was one of three philosophers sent to [[Rome]] in 155 BC. He wrote many works, but  [[lost books|none of his writings survived]], except as quotations by later writers.

==Life==
Born in [[Seleucia on the Tigris]] in [[Babylonia]], Diogenes was educated at [[Athens]] under the auspices of [[Chrysippus]] and succeeded [[Zeno of Tarsus]] as head (''[[scholarch]]'') of the Stoic school there in the 2nd century BC.  Among his pupils were [[Panaetius]] and [[Antipater of Tarsus]] who succeeded him as scholarch.  He seems to have closely followed the views of Chrysippus, especially on [[dialectic]], in which he is said to have instructed [[Carneades]].<ref>Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 30; ''De Oratore'', ii. 38</ref>

Together with Carneades and [[Critolaus]], he was sent to [[Rome]] to appeal a fine of five hundred [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] imposed on Athens in 155 BC for the sack of [[Oropos|Oropus]].  They delivered their [[epideictic]] speeches first in numerous private assemblies, then in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].  Diogenes pleased his audience chiefly by his sober and temperate mode of speaking.<ref>Aulus Gellius, ''Attic Nights'', vii. 14; Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 45</ref>

[[Cicero]] speaks of him as deceased by 150 BC,<ref>Cicero, ''De Senectute'', 23</ref> and since [[Lucian]] claims that he died at the age of 80,<ref>Lucian, ''Macrobii'', 20</ref> he must have been born around 230 BC. There is some evidence, however, that he may have lived to around 140 BC.<ref>"[the traditional] chronology clashes with the dates for [[Mnesarchus of Athens|Mnesarchus]] and [[Dardanus of Athens|Dardanus]] and with the crucial events in the life of [[Antiochus of Ascalon]]. The date of Diogenes' death can reasonably be put forward at least a decade, to around 140" {{harv|Dorandi|1999|p=41}}</ref>

==Works==
Cicero calls Diogenes "a great and important Stoic".<ref>Cicero, ''De Officiis'', iii. 12</ref>  In the works of the [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] philosopher [[Philodemus]] found in carbonized [[papyrus]] rolls recovered from the ruins of the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], Diogenes is discussed more frequently than any philosopher besides [[Epicurus]] himself.{{sfn|Obbink|2004|pp=73–84}}

He was the author of several works, of which, however, little more than the titles is known:
* Διαλεκτικὴ τέχνη – ''Dialectic Art''.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 51}}
* ''On Divination''.<ref>''De divinatione'': [[Latin]] title given in Cicero, ''De Divinatione'', i. 3, ii. 43</ref>
* ''On [[Athena]]''.<ref>''De Minerva'': Latin title given in Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 15</ref>
* Περὶ τοῦ τῆς ψυχῆς ἡγεμονικοῦ – ''On the Ruling Faculty of the Soul''.<ref>Galen.{{full|date=October 2014}}</ref>
* Περὶ φωνῆς – ''On Speaking''.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 55}}
* Περὶ εὐγενείας – ''Οn Noble Βirth''.<ref>Athenaeus, iv. 168</ref>
* Περὶ νόμων – ''On Laws''.<ref>In several books, the first of which is quoted in Athenaeus, xii.; cf. Cicero, ''De Legibus'' iii. 5, where "Dio" is a false reading for "Diogenes"</ref>

In addition, it appears from Philodemus that he wrote extensive works ''On Music'' and ''On Rhetoric''.{{sfn|Easterling|Knox|1989|pp=195–196}} Some aspects of his views on these two subjects are recoverable from the critical remarks to be found in Philodemus' works on these two subjects.{{sfn|Easterling|Knox|1989|pp=195–196}} There are several passages in Cicero from which we may infer that Diogenes wrote on other subjects also, such as duty, the highest good, and the like.<ref>Cicero, ''De Officiis'', iii. 12, 13, 23; ''De Finibus'', iii. 10, 15</ref>

===''On Music''===
The opinions of Diogenes on music are known through the fragmentary treatise by Philodemus, ''On Music'', which discusses the views of Diogenes.<ref name="scade201">{{Harvnb|Scade|2017|p=201}}</ref> According to Philodemus, Diogenes held that music not only can calm the emotions, but that listening to music can produce harmony and proportion in the soul.<ref name="scade201"/> Diogenes believed that just as diet and exercise can produce a healthy body, so that music can bring health to the mind and can treat psychological illnesses.<ref name="scade201"/> Music naturally pushes one to action.<ref name="delattre254"/> Diogenes uses the example of the trumpet, or similar military instrument, which can stir the soldier to bravery.<ref name="delattre254">{{Harvnb|Delattre|2004|p=254}}</ref> Music is thus an art which leads to virtue.<ref name="delattre254"/>
