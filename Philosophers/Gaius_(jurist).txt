'''Gaius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|eɪ|ə|s}}; ''[[floruit|fl.]]'' AD 130–180) was a [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[jurist]]. Little is known about his personal life, including his name ('''Gaius''' or '''Caius''' being merely his personal name (''[[Roman naming conventions|praenomen]]'')).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} It is also difficult to ascertain the span of his life, but it is assumed he lived from AD 110 to at least AD 179, as he wrote on legislation passed within that time.  

From internal evidence in his works it may be gathered that he flourished in the reigns of the emperors [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]], [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Commodus]]. His works were thus composed between the years 130 and 180. After his death, however, his writings were recognized as of great authority, and the emperor [[Theodosius II]] named him in the ''[[Law of Citations]],'' along with [[Papinian]], [[Ulpian]], [[Herennius Modestinus|Modestinus]] and [[Julius Paulus|Paulus]], as one of the five jurists whose opinions were to be followed by judicial officers in deciding cases. The works of these jurists accordingly became most important sources of [[Roman law]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Besides the ''[[Institutes of Gaius|Institutes]]'', which are a complete exposition of the elements of Roman law, Gaius was the author of treatises on the ''Edicts of the Magistrates'', on the [[Twelve Tables]] ({{lang|la|Ad Legem XII Tabularum}}), on the important ''Lex Papia Poppaea'', and on several other topics. His interest in the antiquities of Roman law is apparent, and for this reason his work is most valuable to the historian of early institutions. In the disputes between the two schools of Roman jurists he generally attached himself to that of the [[Sabinians]], who were said to be followers of [[Gaius Ateius Capito (jurist)|Ateius Capito]], of whose life we have some account in the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' of [[Tacitus]], and to advocate a strict adherence as far as possible to ancient rules, and to resist innovation. Many quotations from the works of Gaius occur in the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]],'' created by [[Tribonian]] at the direction of [[Justinian I]], and so acquired a permanent place in the system of Roman law; while a comparison of the ''[[Institutes of Justinian]]'' with those of Gaius shows that the whole method and arrangement of the later work were copied from that of the earlier, and very numerous passages are word for word the same. The ''Digest'' and the ''Institutes of Justinian'' are part of the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]].'' Probably, for the greater part of the period of three centuries which elapsed between Gaius and Justinian, his ''Institutes'' had been the familiar textbook for all students of Roman law.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==The ''Institutes'' ==
{{Main articles|Institutes of Gaius}}
The ''[[Institutes of Gaius|Institutes]]'' of Gaius, written about the year AD 161, was an introductory textbook of legal institutions divided into four books:<ref>Berger, Adolph. Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law. The American Philosophical Society. September 1953. p 504</ref> the first treating of persons and the differences of the status they may occupy in the eye of the law; the second of things, and the modes in which rights over them may be acquired, including the law relating to [[will (law)|wills]]; the third of intestate succession and of obligations; and the fourth of actions and their forms.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Another circumstance which renders the work of Gaius more interesting to the historical student than that of Justinian, is that Gaius lived at a time when actions were tried by the system of ''formulae'', or formal directions given by the ''[[praetor]]'' before whom the case first came, to the ''judex'' to whom he referred it. Without a knowledge of the terms of these ''formulae'' it is impossible to solve the most interesting question in the history of Roman law, and show how the rigid rules peculiar to the ancient law of Rome were modified by what has been called the equitable jurisdiction of the praetors, and made applicable to new conditions, and brought into harmony with the notions and the needs of a more developed society. It is clear from evidence of Gaius that this result was obtained, not by an independent set of courts administering, as in England previous to the [[Judicature Acts]], a system different from that of the ordinary courts, but by the manipulation of the ''formulae''. In the time of Justinian the work was complete, and the [[formulary system]] had disappeared.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The work was lost to modern scholars, until, in 1816, a palimpsest was discovered by [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|B. G. Niebuhr]] in the chapter library of Verona, in which some of the works of [[St. Jerome]] were written over some earlier writings, which proved to be the lost work of Gaius. The greater part of the [[palimpsest]] has, however, been deciphered with the help of [[August von Bethmann-Hollweg]], and the text is now fairly complete. More recently, two sets of [[papyrus]] fragments have been found.<ref>Details on these manuscripts are provided in L.D. Reynolds (editor), ''Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), p. 174.</ref> The discovery of Gaius' work has thrown a flood of light on portions of the history of Roman law which had previously been most obscure. Much of the historical information given by Gaius is wanting in the compilations of Justinian, and, in particular, the account of the ancient forms of procedure in actions. In these forms can be traced "survivals" from the most primitive times, which provide the science of comparative law with valuable illustrations, which may explain the strange forms of legal procedure found in other early systems.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

There are several editions of the ''Institutes'', beginning with the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of I. F. L. Göschen (Berlin, 1820). The author of the 1911 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] article recommends the English edition of Edward Poste published in 1885,<ref>This translation is [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/gaius-institutes-of-roman-law available online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323004224/http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/gaius-institutes-of-roman-law |date=23 March 2014 }} as a [[PDF]] at the  "Online Library Of Liberty" website</ref> which includes an English translation and copious commentary. More recent editions include E. Seckel and B. Kuebler (8th edition; Leipzig, 1939); [[Francis de Zulueta]], containing his own Latin text with an English translation and commentary (1946);<ref>{{cite book|last=de Zulueta|first=Francis|title=The Institutes of Gaius|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon P.|date=1946}} 2 vols</ref> and W. M. Gordon and O. F. Robinson (London, 1988), with an English translation and the Latin text by Seckel and Kuebler.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=W. M.|last2=Robinson|first2=O.F.|title=The Institutes of Gaius|location=London|publisher=Duckworth|date=1988}}</ref> A comparison of the early forms of action mentioned by Gaius with those used by other primitive societies will be found in Sir [[Henry Maine]]'s ''Early Institutions'', chapter 9.

In the 1950s, the Polish-American sculptor [[Joseph Kiselewski]] was commissioned to create four marble [[Relief|reliefs]] located over the gallery doorway at the Chambers of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in Washington D.C. They are each 28" in diameter. The [[relief]] of Gaius is one of the four.<ref>{{Cite web |title=United States House of Representatives |url=https://www.kiselewskisculpture.com/1950s |access-date=2023-04-20 |website=Joseph Kiselewski |language=en |archive-date=10 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230110164743/https://www.kiselewskisculpture.com/1950s |url-status=live }}</ref>
