'''Ernst Jünger''' ({{IPA|de|ɛʁnst ˈjʏŋɐ}}; 29 March 1895 – 17 February 1998) was a German author, highly decorated soldier, philosopher, and [[entomology|entomologist]] who became publicly known for his [[World War I]] memoir ''[[Storm of Steel]]''.

The son of a successful businessman and chemist, Jünger rebelled against an affluent upbringing and sought adventure in the ''[[Wandervogel]]'' German youth movement, before running away to briefly serve in the [[French Foreign Legion]], which was an illegal act in Germany. However, he escaped prosecution due to his father's efforts and was able to enlist in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] on the outbreak of World War I in 1914. During an ill-fated offensive in 1918 Jünger was badly wounded and was awarded the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'', a rare decoration for one of his rank. Since new awards of the military class ceased with the end of the Prussian monarchy in November 1918, Jünger, who died in 1998, was the last living recipient of the military class award.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gaudi |first=Robert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8DQDQAAQBAJ&q=ernst&pg=PA351 |title=African Kaiser: General Paul Von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918 |date=2017 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-425-28371-4 |language=en}}</ref>

He wrote against liberal values, democracy, and the [[Weimar Republic]], but rejected the advances of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] who were rising to power. During [[World War II]] Jünger served as an army captain in [[Paris in World War II|occupied Paris]], but by 1943 he had turned decisively against Nazi totalitarianism, a change manifested in his work "''[[The Peace (essay)|Der Friede]]''" (''The Peace''). Jünger was dismissed from the army in 1944 after he was indirectly implicated with fellow officers who had [[20 July plot|plotted to assassinate Hitler]]. A few months later, his son died in combat in [[Italian Social Republic|Italy]] after having been sentenced to a [[Strafbataillon|penal battalion]] for political reasons.<ref name="Ernst Britannica"/>

After the war, Jünger was treated with some suspicion as a possible [[Mitläufer|fellow traveller of the Nazis]]. By the later stages of the Cold War, his unorthodox writings about the impact of [[materialism]] in modern society were widely seen as conservative rather than radical nationalist, and his philosophical works came to be highly regarded in mainstream German circles. Jünger ended life as an honoured literary figure, although critics continued to charge him with the glorification of war as a transcendental experience in some of his early works. He was an ardent [[Militarism|militarist]] and one of the most complex and contradictory figures in 20th-century [[German literature]].<ref name="Ernst Britannica">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ernst-Junger|title=Ernst Jünger|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=15 February 2022}}</ref>

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Ernst Jünger was born in [[Heidelberg]] as the eldest of six children of the chemical engineer Ernst Georg Jünger (1868–1943) and of Karoline Lampl (1873–1950). Two of his siblings died as infants. His father acquired some wealth in [[potash]] mining. He went to school in [[Hannover]] from 1901 to 1905, and during 1905 to 1907 to boarding schools in Hanover and Brunswick. He rejoined his family in 1907, in [[Rehburg]], and went to school in [[Wunstorf]] with his siblings from 1907 to 1912. During this time, he developed his passion for [[adventure novel]]s and for [[entomology]].
He spent some time as an exchange student in [[Buironfosse]], [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]], France, in September 1909.
With his younger brother [[Friedrich Georg Jünger]] (1898–1977) he joined the ''[[Wandervogel]]'' movement in 1911. His first poem was published with the ''Gaublatt für Hannoverland'' in November 1911.<ref>[[Heimo Schwilk]], Klett-Cotta, ''Ernst Jünger – Ein Jahrhundertleben'', 2014, [https://books.google.com/books?id=os0rAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT57 chapter 3]. 
[[Heimo Schwilk]] (ed.), ''Ernst Jünger: Leben und Werk in Bildern und Texten'', Klett-Cotta, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHSWgyKFLYwC&pg=PA24 p. 24].</ref> By this time, Jünger had a reputation as a budding [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] poet.<ref>[[Heimo Schwilk]] (ed.), ''Ernst Jünger: Leben und Werk in Bildern und Texten'', Klett-Cotta, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHSWgyKFLYwC&pg=PA27 p. 27].</ref>

In 1913, Jünger was a student at the [[Hamelin]] gymnasium. In November, he travelled to [[Verdun]] and enlisted in the [[French Foreign Legion]] for a five-year term, but with the intention of getting to North Africa. Stationed in a training camp at [[Sidi Bel Abbès]], Algeria, he deserted and travelled to Morocco, but was captured and returned to camp. Six weeks later, he was dismissed from the Legion due to the intervention of the German [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]], and escaped prosecution. On the return journey he was told by his father that the cost of representations to the authorities had amounted to a vast sum. Jünger was sent to a boarding school in Hanover, where fellow pupils included future communist leader [[Werner Scholem]] (1895–1940).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hoffrogge |first=Ralf |title=A Jewish Communist in Weimar Germany: the life of Werner Scholem (1895-1940) |date=2017 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-30952-4 |series=Historical materialism book series |location=Leiden Boston |pages=6, 36}}</ref>

===World War I===
[[File:JungerMedal.jpg|thumb|375x375px|Jünger during World War I, wearing the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]]]]
On 1 August 1914, shortly after the start of [[World War I]], Jünger enlisted as a ''one year volunteer'' and joined the 73rd Hannoverian Fusilier Regiment of the [[19th Division (German Empire)|19th Division]], and, after training, was transported to the [[First Battle of Champagne|Champagne front]] in December. He was wounded for the first time in April 1915. While on convalescent leave he took up a position his father arranged for him to become an officer aspirant (''[[Fahnenjunker]]''). Jünger was commissioned a Leutnant (2nd Lieutenant) on 27 November 1915. As platoon leader, he gained a reputation for his combat exploits and initiative in offensive patrolling and reconnaissance.
 
During the [[Battle of the Somme]] near the obliterated remains of the village of Guillemont his platoon took up a front line position in a defile that had been shelled until it consisted of little more than a dip strewn with the rotting corpses of predecessors. He wrote:
{{Quote|As the storm raged around us, I walked up and down my sector. The men had fixed bayonets. They stood stony and motionless, rifle in hand, on the front edge of the dip, gazing into the field. Now and then, by the light of a flare, I saw steel helmet by steel helmet, blade by glinting blade, and I was overcome by a feeling of invulnerability. We might be crushed, but surely we could not be conquered.<ref>''Storm of Steel'' translated by Michael Hoffman, Penguin p. 99</ref>}}

The platoon was relieved but Jünger was wounded by shrapnel in the rest area of [[Combles]] and hospitalized; his platoon reoccupied the position on the eve of the [[Battle of Guillemont]] and was obliterated in a British offensive.<ref>original casualty report, published 4 October 1916, 
[http://des.genealogy.net/search/show/4759829 p. 15,280].</ref> He was wounded for the third time in November 1916, and awarded the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross First Class]] in January 1917.{{Sfn | Jünger | 2004 | p = 119}}

In the spring of 1917, he was promoted to Hauptmann, commanding 7th company and stationed at [[Cambrai]]. Transferred to [[Battle of Langemarck (1917)|Langemarck]] in July, Jünger's actions against the advancing British included forcing retreating soldiers to join his resistance line at gunpoint. He arranged the evacuation of his brother [[Friedrich Georg Jünger|Friedrich Georg]], who had been wounded. In the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)]] Jünger sustained two wounds, by a bullet passing through his helmet at the back of the head, and another by a shell fragment on the forehead.

He was awarded the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]]. While advancing to take up positions just before Ludendorff's [[Operation Michael]] on 19 March 1918, Jünger was forced to call a halt after the guides lost their way, and while bunched together half of his company were lost to a direct hit from artillery. Jünger himself survived, and led the survivors as part of a successful advance but was wounded twice towards the end of the action, being shot in the chest and less seriously across the head. After convalescing, he returned to his regiment in June, sharing a widespread feeling that the tide had now turned against Germany and victory was impossible.

On 25 August, he was wounded for the seventh and final time near [[Favreuil]], being shot through the lung while leading his company in an advance that was quickly overwhelmed by a British counter-attack. Becoming aware the position where he was lying wounded was about to fall to advancing British forces, Jünger rose and as he did his lung drained of fluids through the wound in his chest, allowing him to recover enough to escape. He made his way to a machine-gun post that was holding out, where a doctor told him to lie down immediately. Carried to the rear in a tarpaulin, he and the bearers came under fire and the doctor was killed. A soldier who tried to carry Jünger on his shoulders was killed after only making it a few yards, but another soldier was able to do so.

Jünger received the [[Wound Badge|Wound Badge 1st Class]]. While he was treated in a Hannover hospital, on 22 September he received notice of being awarded the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'' on the recommendation of division commander [[Johannes von Busse]]. ''Pour le Mérite'', the highest military decoration of the German Empire, was awarded some 700 times during the war, but almost exclusively to high-ranking officers (and seventy times to combat pilots). Jünger was one of only eleven infantry company leaders who received the order.<ref name="Kiesel">[[Helmuth Kiesel]], ''Ernst Jünger: Die Biographie'', Siedler Verlag, 2009.</ref>

Throughout the war, Jünger kept a diary, which became the basis of his 1920 ''[[Storm of Steel]]''. He spent his free time reading the works of [[Nietzsche]], [[Schopenhauer]], [[Ariosto]] and [[Alfred Kubin|Kubin]], besides entomological journals he was sent from home. During 1917, he was collecting beetles in the trenches and while on patrol, 149 specimens between 2 January and 27 July, which he listed under the title of ''Fauna coleopterologica douchyensis'' ("[[Coleopterology|Coleopterological]] fauna of the [[Douchy-les-Mines|Douchy]] region").<ref name="Kiesel"/>

===Interwar period===
[[File:Ernst Juenger inSG.jpg|thumb|Ernst Jünger in uniform as depicted in the frontispiece of the 3rd edition of ''In Stahlgewittern'' (1922)]]

Jünger served as a lieutenant in the [[Reichswehr|army]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] until his [[demobilisation]] in 1923. He studied [[marine biology]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], and [[philosophy]], and became a well-known [[entomologist]]. In Germany, an important entomological prize is named after him: the ''Ernst-Jünger-Preis für Entomologie''.<ref>[[:de:Ernst-Jünger-Preis für Entomologie]]</ref> His war experiences described in ''Storm of Steel'' (German title: ''In Stahlgewittern''), which Jünger self-published in 1920, gradually made him famous. He married Gretha von Jeinsen (1906–60) in 1925. They had two children, Ernst Jr. (1926–44) and Alexander (1934–93).

He criticized the fragile and unstable democracy of the [[Weimar Republic]], stating that he "hated democracy like the plague."{{Sfn | Hoffmann | 2004 | p = vii}} More explicitly than in ''Storm of Steel'', he portrayed war as a mystical experience that revealed the nature of existence.{{Sfn | Garland | Garland | 1997a | p = 437}} According to Jünger, the essence of the modern was found in total mobilisation for military effectiveness, which tested the capacity of the human senses.{{Sfn | Bullock | 1992 | p = 549}} In 1932, he published ''[[The Worker: Dominion and Form|The Worker]]'' (German title: ''Der Arbeiter''), which called for the creation of an activist society run by warrior-worker-scholars.{{Sfn | Hoffmann | 2004 | p = x}} In the essay ''On Pain'',<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.telospress.com/main/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=357 | title = On pain | publisher = Telos press | type = translation}}</ref> written and published in 1934, Jünger rejects the liberal values of liberty, security, ease, and comfort, and seeks instead the measure of man in the capacity to withstand pain and sacrifice. Around this time his writing included the aphorism "What doesn't kill me makes me stronger; and what kills me makes me incredibly strong."<ref>Michael Hoffman's Introduction to ''Storm of Steel''</ref>

===Third Reich===
As a famous war hero and prominent nationalist critic of the Weimar Republic, the ascendant [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) courted Jünger as a natural ally, but Jünger rejected such advances. When Jünger moved to Berlin in 1927, he rejected an offer of a seat in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] for the NSDAP. In 1930, he openly denounced Hitler's suppression of the [[Rural People's Movement]].<ref>Peter Longerich: ''Jünger, Ernst, Schriftsteller''. In: Wolfgang Benz, Hermann Graml (Hrsg.): ''Biographisches Lexikon zur Weimarer Republik''. C. H. Beck, München 1988,  164f.</ref> 
In the 22 October 1932 edition of ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' (the official Nazi newspaper), the article "''Das endlose dialektische Gespräch''" ("the never-ending dialectical debate") attacked Jünger for his rejection of the "[[blood and soil]]" doctrine, accusing him of being an "intellectualist" and a liberal.<ref name="Barr">{{cite news|last=Barr|first=Hilary Barr|title=An Exchange on Ernst Jünger|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1993/dec/16/an-exchange-on-ernst-junger/?pagination=false|access-date=8 July 2013|newspaper=New York Review of Books|date=24 June 1993}}</ref> Jünger again refused a seat offered to him in the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] following the [[Nazi Party]]'s [[Machtergreifung|ascension to power]] in January 1933, and he refused the invitation to head the German Academy of Literature (''Die deutsche Akademie der Dichtung'').{{Sfn | Hoffmann | 2004 | p = viii}}

On 14 June 1934, Jünger wrote a "letter of rejection" to the ''Völkischer Beobachter'', in which he requested that none of his writings be published in it.<ref name="Barr" /> Jünger also refused to speak on [[Joseph Goebbels]]'s radio. He was one of the few "nationalist" authors whose names were never found on the frequent declarations of loyalty to Hitler. He and his brother Friedrich Georg quit the "''Traditionsverein der 73er''" (veteran's organization of the Hanoverian regiment they had served during World War I) when its Jewish members were expelled.<ref name="Barr" />

When Jünger left [[Berlin]] in 1933, his house was searched several times by the [[Gestapo]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://tempspresents.com/2009/08/24/stephane-francoisqu%e2%80%99est-ce-que-la-revolution-conservatrice/|title=Qu'est ce que la Révolution Conservatrice ?|last=Stéphane François|author-link=Stéphane François|date=24 August 2009|website=Fragments sur les Temps Présents|language=fr-FR|access-date=23 July 2019|quote=Le domicile d’Ernst Jünger fut fouillé plusieurs fois par la Gestapo.}}</ref> ''[[On the Marble Cliffs]]'' (1939, German title: ''Auf den Marmorklippen''), a short novel in the form of a parable, uses [[metaphor]] to describe Jünger's negative perceptions of the situation in Hitler's Germany.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Ross |first=Alex |date=26 June 2023 |title=Ernst Jünger's Narratives of Complicity |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/03/on-the-marble-cliffs-ernst-junger-book-review |access-date=24 March 2024 |magazine=The New Yorker |language=en-US |issn=0028-792X}}</ref>

He served in [[World War II]] as an [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|army]] [[Hauptmann|captain]]. On the Western Front in 1939, he rescued a wounded soldier and was again awarded the Iron Cross Second Class.<ref>Andrea Benedetti, Lutz Hagestedt, ''Totalität als Faszination: Systematisierung des Heterogenen im Werk Ernst Jüngers'', Walter De Gruyter 2018, p. 341</ref> Assigned to an administrative position as intelligence officer and mail censor in Paris, he socialized (often at the [[Georges V Hotel in Paris|Georges V hotel]] or at [[Maxim's]]) with prominent artists of the day such as [[Picasso]] and [[Jean Cocteau]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/MitchellDevils|title = The Devil's Captain: Ernst Jünger in Nazi Paris, 1941-1944| date=May 2011 | publisher=Berghahn Books | doi=10.3167/9780857451149 | isbn=978-0-85745-114-9 | last1=Mitchell | first1=Allan }}</ref> He also went to the salons of [[Marie-Louise Bousquet]] and [[Florence Gould]].

Ernst Jünger].</ref> Jünger also met the latter at the German Institute on 7 December 1941. He noted in his Parisian diary (''Strahlungen'') that Céline on that occasion "spoke of his consternation, his astonishment, at the fact that we soldiers were not shooting, hanging, and exterminating the Jews".<ref name="Strahlungen">{{Cite book |last=Jünger |first=Ernst |title=A German Officer in Occupied Paris: The War Journals, 1941-1945 |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2019 |isbn=9780231548380}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=k2NbDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT7 Chapter I, First Parisian Journal].</ref> He passed on information about upcoming transports "at an acceptable level of risk" which saved Jewish lives. His office was in the Hotel Majestic and he was billeted at the Hotel Raphael.{{sfn|Jünger|2019|pp=xv,xvi,xvii,xxi}}

Jünger found his countrymen's discriminatory treatment of French Jews unacceptable. In his Parisian diaries, the writer wrote on 7 June 1942 that he had encountered for the first time the [[Yellow badge|yellow star]] carried by three little girls who were passing by in the Rue Royale, and that he considered that day as fundamental in his personal history, because he said he was ashamed at that moment of wearing a German officer's uniform.<ref name="Strahlungen" />

His early time in France is described in his aforementioned diary ''Strahlungen'' (Radiations), which includes "Gärten und Straßen" (Gardens and Streets) and "Das erste Pariser Tagebuch" (The First Parisian Diary). He was also given the task of executing a German deserter who had beaten the women sheltering him and been turned in. Jünger considered avoiding the assignment but eventually attended to oversee the execution in, as he claimed in his journal, "the spirit of higher curiosity".<ref>{{Cite book | author= Berndt Engelmann |date= 1986 |title= In Hitler's Germany | url= https://archive.org/details/inhitlersgermany0000enge | url-access= registration | page=[https://archive.org/details/inhitlersgermany0000enge/page/239 239] |publisher= Pantheon Books |isbn= 9780394524498 |postscript=;}} citing Gerhard Heller, ''Un Allemand à Paris''.</ref>

Jünger appears on the fringes of the [[July 20 Plot|Stauffenberg bomb plot]]. He was clearly an inspiration to anti-Nazi conservatives in the German Army,{{Sfn | Neaman | 1999 | p = 122-23}} and while in Paris he was close to the old, mostly [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]], officers who carried out the assassination attempt against Hitler. On 6 June 1944 Jünger went to [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]]'s headquarters at [[La Roche-Guyon]], arriving late at about 9 PM as the bridge at Mantes was down. Present were Rommel's chief-of-staff [[Hans Speidel]], General [[Otto Wagener|Wagener]], Colonel [[Hans Otfried von Linstow|Linstow]], Embassy Counsellor {{interlanguage link|Peter Pfeiffer|de|Peter Pfeiffer (Diplomat)}}, reporter Major {{interlanguage link|Wilhelm von Schramm|de|Wilhelm Ritter von Schramm}} and Speidel's brother-in-law Max Horst (Rommel was in Germany). At 9.30 PM they went to Speidel's quarters to discuss ''"[[The Peace (essay)|Der Friede]]"'' (The Peace), Jünger's 30-page peace proposal (written in 1943), to be given to the Allies after Hitler's demise or removal from power; also proposed is a united Europe. He returned about midnight. The next day at the Paris HQ Jünger was stunned by the news of the [[Normandy landings]].{{sfn|Jünger|2019|p=328}}<ref>{{cite book |last=  Margaritis |first= Peter |title= Countdown to D-Day: The German perspective |year= 2019 |publisher= Casemate |location= Oxford, UK & PA, USA |isbn= 978-1-61200-769-4 |page= 534 }}</ref>

Jünger was only peripherally involved in the events, however, and in the aftermath suffered only dismissal from the army in August 1944 rather than execution. He was saved by the chaos of the last months of the war, and by always being "inordinately careful", burning writings on sensitive matters from 1933. One source ([[Friedrich Hielscher]]) claimed that Hitler said "Nothing happens to Jünger".{{sfn|Jünger|2019|p=xiii,xxi,xxii}}

His elder son Ernst Jr., then an eighteen-year-old naval ([[Kriegsmarine]]) cadet, was imprisoned that year for engaging in "subversive discussions" in his [[Wilhelmshaven]] Naval Academy (a capital offence). Transferred to [[Strafbattalion|Penal Unit]] [[999th Light Afrika Division (Germany)|999]] as ''Frontbewährung'' after his parents had spoken to the presiding judge Admiral [[Ernst Scheurlen]], he was killed near [[Carrara]] in [[Italian Social Republic|occupied Italy]] on 29 November 1944 (though Jünger was never sure whether he had been shot by the enemy or by the SS).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ernst Jünger-Handbuch: Leben – Werk – Wirkung|last=Schöning|first=Matthias |publisher=Verlag J.B. Meztler|year=2014|location=Stuttgart|page=292}}</ref>{{sfn|Jünger|2019|pp=xxiii,379}}

===Post-war period===
After the war, Jünger was initially under some suspicion for his nationalist past, and he was banned from publishing in Germany for four years by the British occupying forces because he refused to submit to the [[denazification]] procedures.{{Sfn | Hoffmann | 2004 | p = x}} His work ''The Peace'' (German title: ''Der Friede''), written in 1943 and published abroad in 1948, marked the end of his involvement in politics. When [[German Communist Party|German Communists]] threatened his safety in 1945, [[Bertolt Brecht]] instructed them to "Leave Jünger alone."<ref>{{cite news|last=Buruma|first=Ian| author-link = Ian Buruma |title=The Anarch at Twilight |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1993/jun/24/the-anarch-at-twilight/|access-date=8 May 2013|newspaper=New York Review of Books}}</ref> 
His public image rehabilitated by the 1950s, he went on to be regarded as a towering figure of [[German literature|West German literature]].

West German publisher Klett put out a ten-volume collected works (''Werke'') in 1965, extended to 18 volumes 1978–1983.
This made Jünger one of just four German authors to see two subsequent editions of their collected works published during their lifetime, alongside [[Goethe]], [[Klopstock]] and [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]].{{Sfn | Hoffmann | 2004 | p = xi}}

His diaries from 1939 to 1949 were published under the title ''[[Strahlungen (Ernst Jünger)|Strahlungen]]'' (1948, ''Reflections''). In the 1950s and 1960s, Jünger travelled extensively. His first wife, Gretha, died in 1960, and in 1962 he married Liselotte Lohrer. He continued writing prodigiously for his entire life, publishing more than 50 books.

[[File:Maison ernst jünger wilflingen.jpg|thumb|Ernst Jünger House in Wilflingen]]

[[Martin Heidegger]] was heavily influenced by Jünger's ''The Worker'' although he did not regard Jünger as a philosopher.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HAXt8IDlx0C&q=j%C3%BCnger+Heidegger+Nietzsche&pg=PA23|title=The Heidegger Reader|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-35371-9|page=22|editor=Günter Figal|language=en}}</ref> Heidegger's interpretation of Jünger's work is compiled in volume 90 of his complete edition, titled "Zu Ernst Jünger".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Heidegger, Martin: Zu Ernst Jünger|url=https://www.klostermann.de/Heidegger-Zu-Ernst-Juenger-Ln|access-date=14 December 2020|website=www.klostermann.de|language=de}}</ref>

Jünger was among the forerunners of [[magical realism]]. His vision in ''[[The Glass Bees]]'' (1957, German title: ''Gläserne Bienen''), of a future in which an automated machine-driven world threatens [[individualism]], could be seen as a story within the science fiction genre. A sensitive poet with training in [[botany]] and [[zoology]], as well as a soldier, his works in general are infused with tremendous details of the natural world.

Throughout his life he had experimented with [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] such as [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[cocaine]], and [[hashish]]; and later in life he used [[mescaline]] and [[LSD]]. These experiments were recorded comprehensively in ''[[Annäherungen]]'' (1970, ''Approaches''). The novel ''[[Visit to Godenholm|Besuch auf Godenholm]]'' (1952, ''Visit to Godenholm'') is clearly influenced by his early experiments with mescaline and LSD. 
He met with LSD inventor [[Albert Hofmann]] and they took LSD together several times. Hofmann's memoir ''LSD, My Problem Child'' describes some of these meetings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychedelic-library.org/child7.htm|title=LSD, My Problem Child · Radiance from Ernst Junger|website=www.psychedelic-library.org|access-date=14 January 2015|archive-date=12 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210512173700/http://www.psychedelic-library.org/child7.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

One of the most important contributions of Jünger's later literary production is the metahistoric figure of the ''[[Anarch (sovereign individual)|Anarch]]'', an ideal figure of a [[self-ownership|sovereign individual]], conceived in his novel ''[[Eumeswil]]'' (1977),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Macklin|first=Graham D.|date=September 2005|title=Co-opting the counter culture: Troy Southgate and the National Revolutionary Faction|journal=Patterns of Prejudice|type=[[.pdf]]|volume=39|issue=3|pages=301–326|doi=10.1080/00313220500198292|s2cid=144248307}}<!--| access-date = 2007-12-09--></ref> which evolved from his earlier conception of the ''Waldgänger'', or "Forest Fleer"

In 1981, Jünger was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]].
Jünger was immensely popular in France, where at one time 48 of his translated books were in print.{{Sfn | Hoffmann | 2004 | p = xii}} In 1984, he spoke at the Verdun memorial, alongside his admirers, French president [[François Mitterrand]] and the German chancellor, where he called the "ideology of war" in Germany before and after World War I "a calamitous mistake".{{Sfn | Hoffmann | 2004 | p = xiv}} <ref>{{Citation | first = David | last = Binder | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06EFDB143FF93BA25751C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=3 | title = Ernst Jünger, Contradictory German Author Who Wrote About War, Is Dead at 102 | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 18 February 1998}}</ref> In France he remains a near idol of the identitarian and Europeanist far-right (in the works of philosopher [[Alain de Benoist]]).

Although he had been cleared of the accusation of Nazi collaboration since the 1950s, Jünger's [[national conservatism]] and his ongoing role as conservative philosopher and icon made him a controversial figure, and Huyssen (1993)
argued that nevertheless "his conservative literature made Nazism highly attractive",{{Sfn | Huyssen | 1993 | p = 5}} and that "the ontology of war depicted in ''[[Storm of Steel]]'' could be interpreted as a model for a new, hierarchically ordered society beyond democracy, beyond the security of bourgeois society and ennui".{{Sfn |Huyssen|1993|p = 8}} [[Walter Benjamin]] wrote "Theories of German Fascism" (1930) as a review of ''War and Warrior'', a collection of essays edited by Jünger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/kritiken-und-rezensionen-1912-1931-2981/97|title=Theorien des deutschen Faschismus|last=Benjamin|first=Walter|publisher=Project-Gutenberg-DE|language=de|access-date=30 March 2017}} English translation: {{cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Walter|translator=Jerolf Wikoff|year=1979|title=Theories of German Fascism: On the Collection of Essays War and Warrior, Edited by Ernst Jünger|journal=New German Critique|issue=17|pages=120–128 |doi=10.2307/488013 |jstor=488013}}</ref> 
Despite the ongoing political criticism of his work, Jünger said he never regretted anything he wrote, nor would he ever take it back.{{Sfn | Hoffmann | 2004 | p = xii}}

His younger son Alexander, a physician, committed suicide in 1993.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Binder |first1=David |title=Ernst Junger, Contradictory German Author Who Wrote About War, Is Dead at 102 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/18/arts/ernst-junger-contradictory-german-author-who-wrote-about-war-is-dead-at-102.html |access-date=25 March 2024 |agency=New York Times |date=18 February 1998}}</ref> Jünger's 100th birthday on 29 March 1995 was met with praise from many quarters, including the socialist French president [[François Mitterrand]].

===Death===
Jünger came from a mixed Christian Protestant, agnostic family and did not profess any particular denominational belief, but shortly before he died he converted to Roman Catholicism.{{sfn|Nevin|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dG43uaZNSC0C&pg=PA218 218]}}<ref>[[Mitchell, Alan]], ''The Devil's Captain, Ernst Jünger in Nazi Paris, 1941-1944'', Berghahn Books, 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-g6K85Xo20C p. 33].</ref><ref>[https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/11/standing-against-tyranny Standing Against Tyranny], [[First Things]]. ''A year before the end of his long life (1895–1998), the German author Ernst Jünger converted to Catholicism, a late change on a tumultuous path of searching and adventures that were far from exclusively spiritual. Born into a Protestant family, he attended conventional boarding schools, but at the age of eighteen ran away to France to join the Foreign Legion.''</ref> A year before his death, Jünger was received into the [[Catholic Church]] and began to receive the [[Sacrament]]s.<ref>Laska, Bernd A.

==Photography==
Ernst Jünger's photobooks are visual accompaniments to his writings on technology and [[modernity]]. The seven books of photography Jünger published between 1928 and 1934 are representative of the most militaristic and radically right wing period in his writing. Jünger's first photobooks, ''Die Unvergessenen'' (The Unforgotten, 1929) and ''Der Kampf um das Reich'' (The Battle for the Reich, 1929) are collections of photographs of fallen [[World War I]] soldiers and the World War front, many that he took himself. He also contributed six essays on the relationship between war and photography in a photobook of war images called ''Das Antlitz des Weltkrieges: Fronterlebnisse deutscher Soldaten'' (The Face of the World War: Front Experiences of German Soldiers, 1930) and edited a volume of photographs dealing with the first world war, ''Hier spricht der Feind: Kriegserlebnisse unserer Gegner'' (The Voice of the Enemy: War Experiences of our Adversaries, 1931). Jünger also edited a collection of essays, ''Krieg und Krieger'' (War and Warriors, 1930, 1933) and wrote the foreword for a photo anthology of airplanes and flying called ''Luftfahrt ist Not!'' (Flying is imperative! [i.e., a necessity], 1928).<ref>Gil, Isabel Capeloa. 2010. "The Visuality of Catastrophe in Ernst Jünger's ''Der gefährliche Augenblick'' and ''Die veränderte Welt''".
