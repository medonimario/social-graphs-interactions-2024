'''Amadeo Bordiga''' (13 June 1889 – 25 July 1970) was an Italian [[Marxist]] theorist. A [[revolutionary socialist]], Bordiga was the founder of the [[Communist Party of Italy]] (PCdI), member of the [[Communist International]] (Comintern), and later a leading figure of the [[Internationalist Communist Party (Italy)|Internationalist Communist Party]] (PCInt). He was originally associated with the PCdI but was expelled in 1930 after being accused of [[Trotskyism]]. Bordiga is viewed as one of the most notable representatives of [[left communism]] in Europe.

== Early life, family, and education ==
Bordiga was born at [[Resina]] in the [[province of Naples]] in 1889. His father, Oreste Bordiga, was an esteemed scholar of [[agricultural science]], whose authority was especially recognized in regard to the centuries-old agricultural problems of [[Southern Italy]]. His mother, Zaira degli Amadei, was descended from an ancient [[Florence|Florentine]] family and his maternal grandfather Count Michele Amadei was a conspirator in the struggles of the [[Risorgimento]]. His paternal uncle, [[Giovanni Bordiga]], another militant of the ''[[Risorgimento]]'', was a [[mathematician]] and professor at the [[University of Padua]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/ocm42041262 |title=Amadeo Bordiga nella storia del comunismo |date=1999 |publisher=Edizioni scientifiche italiane |isbn=978-88-8114-824-0 |editor-last=Cortesi |editor-first=Luigi |location=Napoli |oclc=ocm42041262}}</ref>

Bordiga's upbringing, while being thoroughly radical, was also of a highly scientific nature. An opponent of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] as an Italian colonial war in [[Italian Libya|Libya]], Bordiga was introduced to the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI) by his high-school [[physics]] teacher in 1910. Bordiga eventually founded the Karl Marx Circle in 1912, where he would meet his first wife, Ortensia De Meo. Bordiga graduated with a degree in [[engineering]] from [[University of Naples Federico II]] in 1912. Bordiga married De Meo in 1914. They had two children, Alma and Oreste. Ortensia died in 1955, and Bordiga married Ortensia's sister, Antonietta De Meo, ten years later in 1965.<ref name="wife">{{Cite web |url=http://www.avantibarbari.it/news.php?sez_id=3&news_id=50 |title=Avanti Barbari! |access-date=2020-12-15 |archive-date=2016-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115193809/http://www.avantibarbari.it/news.php?sez_id=3&news_id=50 |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref>

== Political career ==
=== Italian Socialist Party ===
Within the newly founded Karl Marx Circle, Bordiga rejected a [[pedagogical]] approach to political work and developed a "theory of the Party", whereby the organization was meant to display non-immediate goals as a rally of similarly minded people and not necessarily a body of the [[working class]]. Bordiga was deeply opposed to [[representative democracy]], which he associated with bourgeois [[electoralism]]. In a 1914 issue of ''Il Socialista'', he wrote: "Thus if there is a complete negation of the theory of democratic action it is to be found in socialism." Bordiga opposed the parliamentary faction of the PSI being autonomous from central control. In common with most socialists in [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin countries]], Bordiga campaigned against [[Freemasonry]], which he identified as a non-[[Secularism|secular]] group.

Following the [[October Revolution]], Bordiga rallied to the [[communist]] movement and formed the communist [[abstention]]ist faction within the PSI, abstentionist in that it opposed participation in [[bourgeois]] elections. The group would form with the addition of the former ''[[L'Ordine Nuovo]]'' grouping in [[Turin]] around [[Antonio Gramsci]] the backbone of the [[Communist Party of Italy]] (PCdI). This came after a long internal struggle in the PSI as it had voted as early as 1919 to affiliate to the [[Comintern]] but had refused to purge its [[reformist]] wing. In the course of the conflict, Bordiga attended the 2nd Comintern Congress in 1920, where he added two points to the [[Twenty-one Conditions]] of membership proposed by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Nevertheless, he was criticised by Lenin in his work ''[["Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' (1920) over a disagreement regarding parliamentary abstentionism. [[Victor Serge]], who witnessed the 2nd Comintern Congress, remembered Bordiga as "exuberant and energetic, features blunt, hair thick, black and bristly, a man quivering under his encumbrance of ideas, experiences and dark forecasts."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Serge |first1=Victor |title=Memoirs of a Revolutionary |date=1984 |publisher=Writers and Readers Co-operative |location=London |isbn=0-86316-070-0 |page=105}}</ref>

=== Communist Party of Italy ===
[[File:Amadeo Bordiga.jpg|thumb|Bordiga in a 1920 drawing by Soviet painter [[Isaak Brodsky]]]]
When the PSI held its congress at [[Livorno]] in January 1921, representatives sent by Comintern, all insisted that the party must expel its reformist wing led by [[Filippo Turati]] but were divided over whether to continue to work with [[Giacinto Menotti Serrati]], who advised delaying the split. Bordiga advocated an immediate break with both Serrati and Turati, and hence with the majority of the PSI, and prevailed against the opposition of the leading Comintern representative [[Paul Levi]] but also with the backing of others, including [[Mátyás Rákosi|Matyas Rakosi]], the future [[Stalinist]] dictator of Hungary.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Milorad M. Drachkovitch |first1=and Branko Lazitch |title=The Comintern - Historical Highlights |date=1966 |publisher=Frederick A. Praeger |location=New York |pages=275–81}}</ref> 

After the congress, Bordiga emerged as leader of the newly formed Communist Party of Italy. He was one of five members of the executive but was "the actual director of all party activity".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Drachkovitch |first1=and Lazitch |title=Historical Highlights |page=359}}</ref> For Bordiga, the party was the social brain of the [[proletariat]] whose task was not to seek majority support but to concentrate on working for an armed insurrection in the course of which it would seize power and then use it to abolish [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] and impose a [[communist society]] by force. Bordiga identified with the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and the dictatorship of the party, and argued that establishing its own dictatorship should be the party's immediate and direct aim.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} This position was accepted by the majority of the members of the PCdI but was to bring them into conflict with the Comintern when in 1921 the latter adopted a new tactic, i.e. that of the [[united front]] with reformist organisations to fight for [[social reforms]] and even to form a workers' government. Bordiga regarded this as a reversion to the failed tactics which the pre-war [[social democrats]] had adopted and which had led to them becoming reformists.

Out of a regard for discipline, Bordiga and his comrades (who became known as the [[Italian communist left]]) accepted the Comintern decision but were in an increasingly difficult position. When Bordiga was arrested in February 1923 on a trumped-up charge by the new government of [[Benito Mussolini]], he had to give up his post as a member of the Central Committee of the PCdI. On his acquittal later that year, Bordiga decided not to reclaim it, therefore implicitly accepting that he was now an oppositionist.

At the Fifth Congress of Comintern in Moscow held in June–July 1924, Bordiga was the sole voice of the [[Ultra-leftism|ultra-left]] who opposed any cooperation with socialist parties in favour of a "united front from below, not from above", which received support except within the Italian delegation. He argued that the rise of Mussolini and the [[Italian fascists]] was only "a change in the governing personnel of the bourgeois class."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carr |first1=E.H. |title=Socialism in One Country, 1924-26, volume 3 |date=1972 |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex |pages=78–80, 84}}</ref> Also in 1924, the Italian communist left lost control of the PCdI to a pro-Moscow group whose leader Gramsci became the party's [[List of secretaries of the Italian Communist Party|General Secretary]] in June. In March 1925, Bordiga refused to go to Moscow to attend a plenum of Comintern's executive, and in his absence was accused of taking up a "hostile position against Comintern by declaring his complete solidarity with [[Trotsky]]".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carr |title=Socialism in One Country, volume 3 |page=380}}</ref>

At the Third Congress of the PCdI held in exile in Lyons in January 1926, the manoeuvre of the pro-Moscow group was completed. Without the support of the Communist International to escape from [[Fascist Italy|Fascist]] control,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} few members of the Italian communist left were able to arrive at the Congress, so the theses drawn up by Bordiga were rejected. Those of the [[Stalinist]] minority group accepted.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Under arrest ===
In December 1926, Bordiga was again arrested by Mussolini and sent to prison in [[Ustica]], an Italian island in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], where he met with Gramsci and they renewed their friendship and worked alongside each other despite their political differences. Bordiga was concerned about Gramsci's ill health but nothing came of a plan to help him escape the island. In 1928, Bordiga was moved to the Isle of [[Ponza]], where he built several houses, returning after his detention in 1929 to finish them.<ref name =sconfitta>{{cite book|last1=Peregalli|first1=Arturo|last2=Saggioir|first2=Sandro|title=La sconfitta e gli anni oscuri (1926-1945|year=1998|publisher=Edizioni Colibri|location=Milan|url=http://www.left-dis.nl/uk/bordigaunknowm.htm|access-date=2014-04-12|archive-date=2020-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128212144/http://www.left-dis.nl/uk/bordigaunknowm.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Opposition ===
Following his release, Bordiga did not resume his activities in the PCdI and was in fact expelled in March 1930, accused of having "supported, defended and endorsed the positions of the [[Trotskyist]] opposition" and been organisationally disruptive.<ref name =sconfitta/> With his expulsion, Bordiga left political activity until 1943 and he was to refuse to comment on political affairs even when asked by trusted friends; many of his former supporters in the PCdI went into exile and founded a political tendency often referred to as Italian communist left.

In 1928, its members in exile in France and Belgium formed themselves into the Left Fraction of the Communist Party of Italy, which became in 1935 the Italian Fraction of the Communist Left. This change of name was a reflection of the Italian communist left's view that the PCdI and the other Communist parties had now become counter-revolutionary. A faction of the party, with their theory of the party and their opposition to any form of [[Common front|frontism]], held that program was everything and a gate-receipt notion of numbers was nothing. Bordiga would again work with many of these comrades following the end of [[World War II]].

According to the reports of Angelo Alliotta, a secret informant of the fascist police in Italy who visited Bordiga's home in Formia where he holidayed with his wife, Bordiga showed support for the [[Axis powers]]. According to Alliotta, Bordiga believed Nazi Germany was weakening the "English giant", which to him was "the greatest exponent of capitalism", and thus the defeat of Britain would bring about revolutionary conditions in Europe. Bordiga also criticised [[Joseph Stalin]] for allying with the western Allies against the Axis in April 1943.<ref>{{cite web |date=2016-08-09 |title=Storia. Bordiga, il leninista che sperava nell'Asse |url=https://www.avvenire.it/agora/pagine/bordiga- |access-date=2023-10-04 |website=Avvenire |language=it |archive-date=2023-10-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231005004726/https://www.avvenire.it/agora/pagine/bordiga- |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|reason=tertiary source without source reference|date=June 2024}}. Other sources cast doubt on the analysis that Bordiga supported Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy, citing ‘contradictory’ testimony on the issue. He supported the ‘proletarian’ partisan movements, as well as the anti-fascist Warsaw uprisings of 1943 (Warsaw ghetto) and 1944.<ref>{{cite web |date=2010-12-26 |title=An important book on the unknown Bordiga (1926-1946) - Philippe Bourrinet |url=https://libcom.org/article/important-book-unknown-bordiga-1926-1946-philippe-bourrinet |access-date=2024-08-26 |website=Libcom|language=en}}</ref>

=== International Communist Party ===
After 1944, Bordiga first returned to political activity in the [[Naples]]-based Fraction of Socialists and Communists. When this grouping was dissolved into the [[Internationalist Communist Party (Italy)|Internationalist Communist Party]] (PCInt), Bordiga did not initially join; despite this, he contributed anonymously to its press, primarily ''Battaglia Comunista'' and ''Prometeo'', in keeping with his conviction that revolutionary work was collective in nature and his opposition to any form of even incipient [[personality cult]]. Bordiga joined the PCInt in 1949. When the current split in two in 1951, he took the side of the grouping that took on the name [[International Communist Party]], publishing its ''Il Programma Comunista''. Bordiga devoted himself to the party, contributing extensively. Bordiga remained with the ICP until his death at [[Formia]] in 1970.
 
== Theories and beliefs ==
'''Bordigism''' is a variant of [[left communism]] espoused by Bordiga. Bordigists in the [[Italian Socialist Party]] would be the first to refuse on principle any participation in [[parliamentary election]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.internationalism.org/taxonomy/term/76|title=Bordigism|publisher=International Communist Current|access-date=5 November 2016|archive-date=10 March 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310223439/http://en.internationalism.org/taxonomy/term/76|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== On Marxism–Leninism ===
On the theoretical level, Bordiga developed an understanding of the [[Soviet Union]] as a [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist society]].{{sfn|Goldner|1995|p=76}} Bordiga's writings on the capitalist nature of the [[Soviet economy]] in contrast to those produced by the [[Trotskyists]] also focused on the agrarian sector. In analyzing the [[agriculture in the Soviet Union]], Bordiga sought to display the capitalist social relations that existed in the [[kolkhoz]] and [[sovkhoz]], one a cooperative farm and the other a wage-labor state farm.{{sfn|Goldner|1995|p=77}} In particular, he emphasized how much of the national agrarian produce came from small privately owned plots (writing in 1950) and predicted the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after [[Imperial Russia]] had been such a large exporter from the 1880s to 1914.{{sfn|Goldner|1995|pp=73–100}}

In Bordiga's conception of [[Marxism–Leninism]], [[Joseph Stalin]], and later [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and so on, were great [[Romanticism|Romantic]] revolutionaries, i.e. [[bourgeois revolution]]aries. He felt that the [[Marxist–Leninist state]]s that came into existence after 1945 were extending the [[bourgeois]] nature of prior revolutions that degenerated as all had in common a policy of expropriation and agrarian and productive development, which he considered negations of previous conditions and not the genuine construction of socialism.{{sfn|Goldner|1995|p=78}}

=== On democracy ===
Bordiga defined himself as [[anti-democratic]], believing himself to be following the tradition of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. Bordiga's hostility toward democracy was unrelated to the Stalinist narrative of the [[single-party state]], as he saw [[fascism]] and [[Stalinism]] as the culmination of [[bourgeois democracy]]. Followers of Bordiga often state that there is no functional difference between democracy and dictatorship, as one class will inevitably establish control. To Bordiga, democracy meant above all the manipulation of society as a formless mass. To this, he counterposed the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], to be implemented by the [[Communist party]] based on the principles and program enunciated in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848). He often referred to the spirit of Engels' remark that "on the eve of the revolution all the forces of reaction will be against us under the banner of 'pure democracy'" as every factional opponent of the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1921 from the monarchists (the [[White movement]]) to the [[anarchists]], such as the [[Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine]], called for [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] without Bolsheviks—or soviet workers councils not dominated by Bolsheviks. As such, Bordiga opposed the idea of revolutionary theory being the product of a democratic process of pluralist views, believing that the [[Marxist]] perspective has the merit of underscoring the fact that, like all [[social formation]]s, [[communism]] is above all about the expression of programmatic content. This enforces the fact that, for Marxists, communism is not an ideal to be achieved but a real movement born from the old society with a set of programmatic tasks.{{sfn|Goldner|1995|p=81}}

=== On the united front ===
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2024}}
Bordiga resolutely opposed the [[Comintern]]'s turn to the right in 1921. As leader of the [[Communist Party of Italy]], he refused to implement the [[united front]] strategy of the Third Congress. He also refused to fuse the newly formed party with the left-wing of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] from which it had just broken away. Bordiga had a completely different view of the party from the Comintern, which was adapting to the revolutionary ebb that was announced in 1921 by the [[Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement]], the [[Kronstadt rebellion]], the implementation of the [[New Economic Policy]], the [[Ban on factions in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|banning of factions]], and the defeat of the [[March Action]] in Germany. For Bordiga, the Western European Communist parties' strategy of fighting this ebb by absorbing a mass of left-wing [[social democrats]] through the united front was a complete capitulation to the period of [[counter-revolutionary]] ebb he saw setting in. This was the base of his critique of democracy, for it was in the name of conquering the masses that the Comintern seemed to be making all kinds of programmatic concessions to left-wing social democrats. For Bordiga, program was everything, a gate-receipt notion of numbers was nothing. The role of the party in the period of ebb was to preserve the program and to carry on the propaganda work possible until the next turn of the tide, not to dilute it while chasing ephemeral popularity.

Bordiga's analysis provided a way of seeing a fundamental degeneration in the world communist movement in 1921 (instead of in 1927 with the [[defeat of Trotsky]]) without simply calling for more democracy. The abstract formal perspective of bureaucracy/democracy, with which the Trotskyist tradition treats this crucial period in Comintern history, became separated from any content. Bordiga throughout his life called himself a [[Leninist]] and never polemicised against Lenin directly; his totally different appreciation of the 1921 conjuncture, its consequences for the Comintern and his opposition to Lenin and Trotsky on the united front issue illuminates a turning point that is generally obscured by the heirs of the Trotskyist wing of the international left opposition of the 1920s.

=== On communism ===
<!-- Although most Leninists do distinguish between "socialism" and "communism", and Bordiga did consider himself a "Leninist", I am fairly certain he did not distinguish between the two in the same way Leninists do. I think that, although you use the word "stages", it must be clarified here that Bordiga did not see "socialism" as a separate mode of production from communism, rather just as how communism looks as it emerges out of capitalism before it has "developed on its own foundations". Marx used socialism and communism interchangeably. I think Bordiga uses socialism to mean "lower-phase communism", but, again, it must be clarified he does not consider it a separate mode of production. Although this is kind of explained in the rest of the paragraph, I think this distinction from all Leninist must be clarified more. I didn't want to go ahead and try to edit the page directly myself, as I wanted to hear others' thoughts first, and didn't want to be too hasty and correct something in case I am mistaken and it does not need to be corrected. -->
<!-- I think that the article does need to be corrected, but for a different reason than the first hidden comment. There should be a clarification on the fact Lenin's and Bordiga's views on Socialism and Communism were the same. That is, except for the split between the character of socialism after political power is wrested out of the hands of the capitalists (i.e the question of money, etc...). Lenin repeatedly refers to Socialism as the "First Phase of Communism" in his writing of State and Revolution (Penguin Ed. pg 131, 132 etc..) in the same way as Marx does in his Critique of the Gotha Programme. What Lenin and Bordiga differ on is whether or not money and such would exist within this primary stage of Communism (Also known as Socialism). Because of this I wonder what specific "Leninists" the author of this section of the article is talking about, since they seem to be pushing a revision of Lenin's actual thoughts on the matter -->Although most Leninists distinguish between [[socialism]] and [[communism]] and he did consider himself a Leninist, Bordiga did not distinguish between the two in the same way Leninists do. Bordiga did not see socialism as a separate mode of production from communism but rather just as how communism looks as it emerges from capitalism before it has "developed on its own foundations". Bordiga used ''socialism'' to mean what Marx called the [[lower-phase communism]]. Sticking to Marx's concept of communism, for Bordiga both stages of socialist or [[communist society]]—with stages referring to [[historical materialism]]—were characterised by the absence of money, capital, the market, and so on, the difference between them being that earlier in the first stage rationing would be done in a way in which "a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form",<ref name="Gotha">{{Cite book |chapter-url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm |chapter = Critique of the Gotha Programme, Part I |via = marxists.org |author = Karl Marx |orig-date = 1875 |title = Marx/Engels Selected Works |volume = 3 |pages = 13–30 |publisher = Progress Publishers |place = Moscow |date = 1970 |access-date = June 11, 2024 |archive-date = June 11, 2019 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190611214046/https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm |url-status = live }}</ref> with deductions being made from said labor to fund public projects, and difference in interests between the rural and urban proletariat would exist, whilst in communism "bourgeoisie law" would be no more, hence the equal standard applied to all peoples no longer would apply, and the alienated man "will not aim to win back his person" but rather become a new "Social Man".<ref name = "Tablets">{{cite magazine |last = Bordiga |first = Amadeo |date = March 11-25, 1960 |title = Tavole immutabili della teoria comunista del partito |trans-title = Immutable tablets of the communist theory of the party |lang = it |url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/bordiga/works/1960/immutable-tablets.htm |magazine = {{interlanguage link|Il programma comunista|it}} |location = Milan |publisher = [[Internationalist Communist Party]] |access-date = June 11, 2024 |archive-date = June 16, 2024 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240616042959/https://www.marxists.org/archive/bordiga/works/1960/immutable-tablets.htm |url-status = live }}</ref> Arguing against what Bordiga saw as the bourgeois idea of "free producer economies", he instead declared that under communism, whether it be the lower stage or higher stage, production and consumption are both enslaved to society.<ref name = "Fundamentals">{{cite magazine |last = Bordiga |first = Amadeo |date = 1957 |title = The Fundamentals of Revolutionary Communism |url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/bordiga/works/1957/fundamentals.htm |magazine = {{interlanguage link|Il programma comunista|it}} |location = Milan |publisher = [[Internationalist Communist Party]] |access-date = June 11, 2024 |archive-date = June 14, 2024 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240614035844/https://www.marxists.org/archive/bordiga/works/1957/fundamentals.htm |url-status = live }}</ref>

This view distinguished Bordiga from other Leninists and especially the Trotskyists, who tended and still tend to telescope the first two stages and so have money and the other exchange categories surviving into socialism; Bordiga would have none of this. For him, no society in which money, buying, and selling and the rest survived could be regarded as either socialist or communist—these exchange categories would die out before the socialist rather than the communist stage was reached. Within the Marxist movement, ''socialism'' was popularised during the [[Russian Revolution]] by Lenin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Steele |first=David |title=From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher=Open Court Publishing Company |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-87548-449-5 |pages=44–45 |quote=By 1888, the term 'socialism' was in general use among Marxists, who had dropped 'communism', now considered an old fashioned term meaning the same as 'socialism'. ...

== Legacy ==
[[Jacques Camatte]] began corresponding with Bordiga from the age of 19 in 1954, and Bordiga developed a long-standing relationship with Camatte and ideological influence over him. Camatte's early work very much reads in line with the Bordigist current, and Bordiga frequently contributed to Camatte's journal ''[[Invariance (magazine)|Invariance]]'' near the end of his life. Even after Camatte's break with Marxism following Bordiga's death, Camatte's preoccupation within the subject of ''Gemeinwesen'' (community, commonwealth) within Marx's work is consistent with Bordiga's emphasis on the anti-individualist and collectivist aspects of Marxism.{{sfn|El-Ojeili|2015|p=93}} Bordiga also influenced [[Gilles Dauvé]], and had great influence over the [[Ultra-leftism|ultra-leftist]] currents of the 20th and 21st centuries.<ref>{{cite web |last1=La Banquise |title=Re-collecting our past |url=https://libcom.org/library/re-collecting-our-past-la-banquise |website=Libcom |access-date=2020-12-14 |archive-date=2020-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128082857/https://libcom.org/library/re-collecting-our-past-la-banquise |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Amadeo Bordiga Foundation was established in 1998 in Formia, in the house where Bordiga spent the last several months of his life. The foundation organizes publications of Bordiga's works and encourages further expansions upon his ideas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chi Siamo |url=http://www.fondazionebordiga.org/about.html |publisher=Fondazione Amadeo Bordiga |access-date=2020-12-14 |archive-date=2021-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210422133911/http://www.fondazionebordiga.org/about.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In August 2020, ''[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]]'' published ''The Science and Passion of Communism'', an anthology of English translations of Bordiga's work.{{sfn|Bordiga|2020}}
