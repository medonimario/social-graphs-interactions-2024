'''Karl Marx''' ({{IPA|de|maʁks|lang}}; 5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German-born [[Political philosophy|philosopher]], political theorist, [[economist]], historian, [[Sociology|sociologist]], journalist, and [[revolutionary socialist]]. His best-known works are the 1848 pamphlet ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (with [[Friedrich Engels]]) and his three-volume {{lang|de|[[Das Kapital]]}} (1867–1894); the latter employs his critical approach of [[historical materialism]] in an analysis of [[capitalism]], in the culmination of his intellectual endeavours. Marx's ideas and their subsequent development, collectively known as [[Marxism]], have had enormous influence on modern intellectual, economic and political history.

Born in [[Trier]] in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], Marx studied at the universities of [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Jena|Jena]], and received a [[doctorate]] in philosophy from the latter in 1841. A [[Young Hegelians|Young Hegelian]], he was influenced by the philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and both critiqued and developed Hegel's ideas in works such as ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (written 1846) and the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' (written 1857–1858). While in Paris in 1844, Marx wrote his ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844|Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts]]'' and met Engels, who became his closest friend and collaborator. After moving to Brussels in 1845, they were active in the [[Communist League]], and in 1848 they wrote ''The Communist Manifesto'', which expresses Marx's ideas and lays out a programme for revolution. Marx was expelled from Belgium and Germany, and in 1849 moved to London, where he wrote ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'' (1852) and {{lang|de|Das Kapital}}. From 1864, Marx was involved in the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (First International), in which he fought the influence of [[Anarchism|anarchists]] led by [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. In his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'' (1875), Marx wrote on revolution, the state and the transition to communism. He died [[Statelessness|stateless]] in 1883 and was buried in [[Highgate Cemetery]].

Marx's [[Karl Marx#Critique of political economy, history and society|critiques of history, society and political economy]] hold that human societies develop through [[class conflict]]. In the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], this manifests itself in the conflict between the [[ruling class]]es (known as the [[bourgeoisie]]) that control the [[means of production]] and the [[working class]]es (known as the [[proletariat]]) that enable these means by selling their [[labour power]] in return for wages.<ref name=manifesto/> Employing his historical materialist approach, Marx predicted that capitalism produced [[Internal contradictions of capital accumulation|internal tensions]] like previous socioeconomic systems and that these tensions would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as the [[socialist mode of production]]. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism—owing in part to its instability and [[Economic crisis|crisis]]-prone nature—would eventuate the working class's development of [[class consciousness]], leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a [[Classless society|classless]], [[communist society]] constituted by a [[free association of producers]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Marx |author-link=Karl Marx |chapter-url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm |chapter=Index |title=[[Critique of the Gotha Program]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027041955/http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm |archive-date=27 October 2007 |via=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]}}</ref> Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised [[proletarian revolution]]ary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic [[emancipation]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=23–24}}

Karl Marx was born on 5 May 1818 to [[Heinrich Marx]] and [[Henriette Pressburg]]. He was born at Brückengasse 664 in [[Trier]], an ancient city then part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]'s [[Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine|Province of the Lower Rhine]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=8, 12}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=1}}.</ref> Marx's family was originally [[Jewish secularism|non-religious Jewish]] but had [[Conversion to Christianity|converted formally to Christianity]] before his birth. His maternal grandfather was a Dutch [[rabbi]], while his paternal line had supplied Trier's rabbis since 1723, a role taken by his grandfather Meier Halevi Marx.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=4–5}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=7–9, 12}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=2–3}}.</ref> His father, as a child known as Herschel, was the first in the line to receive a secular education. He became a lawyer with a comfortably [[upper middle class]] income and the family owned a number of [[Moselle wine|Moselle]] vineyards, in addition to his income as an attorney. Prior to his son's birth and after the abrogation of [[Jewish emancipation]] in the [[Rhineland]],<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6q0OHHNyFeEC&pg=PA419 |title=Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews – A History |last=Carroll |first=James |year=2002 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |isbn=978-0-547-34888-9 |page=419 |language=en |access-date=2 April 2018 |archive-date=24 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200924094733/https://books.google.com/books?id=6q0OHHNyFeEC&pg=PA419 |url-status=live |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> Herschel converted from Judaism to join the state [[Prussian Union of Churches|Evangelical Church of Prussia]], taking on the German forename Heinrich over the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] Herschel.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=4–6}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=2–4}}.</ref>

Largely non-religious, Heinrich was a man of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], interested in the ideas of the philosophers [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Voltaire]]. A [[classical liberal]], he took part in agitation for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, which was then an [[absolute monarchy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=5, 8–12}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=11}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=5–6}}.</ref> In 1815, Heinrich Marx began working as an attorney and in 1819 moved his family to a ten-room property near the [[Porta Nigra]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=10}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=7}}.</ref> His wife, Henriette Pressburg, was a Dutch Jew from a prosperous business family that later founded the company [[Philips Electronics]]. Her sister Sophie Pressburg (1797–1854) married [[Lion Philips]] (1794–1866) and was the grandmother of both [[Gerard Philips|Gerard]] and [[Anton Philips]] and great-grandmother to [[Frits Philips]]. Lion Philips was a wealthy Dutch tobacco manufacturer and industrialist, upon whom Karl and [[Jenny von Westphalen|Jenny Marx]] would later often come to rely for loans while they were exiled in London.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|loc=chpt. 6}}</ref>

By employing many [[Liberal humanism|liberal humanists]] as teachers, Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government. Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832 and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students. Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Marx's attendance.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976 |pp=12–15}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=13}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=7–11}}.</ref>

In October 1835 at the age of 16, Marx travelled to the [[University of Bonn]] wishing to study philosophy and literature, but his father insisted on law as a more practical field.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=15–16}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=14}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=13}}.</ref> Due to a condition referred to as a "weak chest",{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=15}} Marx was excused from military duty when he turned 18.

Spending summer and autumn 1836 in Trier, Marx became more serious about his studies and his life. He became engaged to [[Jenny von Westphalen]], an educated member of the [[Edler|petty nobility]] who had known Marx since childhood. As she had broken off her engagement with a young [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] to be with Marx, their relationship was socially controversial owing to the differences between their religious and class origins, but Marx befriended her father [[Ludwig von Westphalen]] (a liberal aristocrat) and later dedicated his doctoral thesis to him.<ref>{{harvnb|Fedoseyev|1973|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=23–30}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=16–21, 33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=15, 20}}.</ref> Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843, they married in a Protestant church in [[Bad Kreuznach|Kreuznach]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=70–71}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=52–53}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=61–62}}.</ref>

In October 1836, Marx arrived in Berlin, matriculating in the university's faculty of law and renting a room in the Mittelstrasse.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=31}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=15}}.</ref> During the first term, Marx attended lectures of [[Eduard Gans]] (who represented the progressive Hegelian standpoint, elaborated on rational development in history by emphasising particularly its libertarian aspects, and the importance of social question) and of [[Karl von Savigny]] (who represented the [[Historical School of Law]]).<ref>{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=21}}</ref> Although studying law, he was fascinated by philosophy and looked for a way to combine the two, believing that "without philosophy nothing could be accomplished".<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=21}}.</ref> Marx became interested in the recently deceased German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], whose ideas were then widely debated among European philosophical circles.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=32–34}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=21–22}}.</ref> During a convalescence in Stralau, he joined the Doctor's Club ({{lang|de|Doktorklub}}), a student group which discussed [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] ideas, and through them became involved with a group of [[Radical politics|radical thinkers]] known as the [[Young Hegelians]] in 1837. They gathered around [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Bruno Bauer]], with Marx developing a particularly close friendship with [[Adolf Rutenberg]]. Like Marx, the Young Hegelians were critical of Hegel's [[metaphysical]] assumptions but adopted his [[Hegelian Dialectic|dialectical method]] to criticise established society, politics and religion from a left-wing perspective.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=34–38}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=34}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=25–27}}.</ref> Marx's father died in May 1838, resulting in a diminished income for the family.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=44,69–70}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=17–18}}.</ref> Marx had been emotionally close to his father and treasured his memory after his death.{{sfn|Sperber|2013|pp=55–56}}

By 1837, Marx was writing both fiction and non-fiction, having completed a short novel, ''[[Scorpion and Felix]]''; a drama, ''[[Oulanem]]''; as well as a number of love poems dedicated to his wife. None of this early work was published during his lifetime.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=18–19}}</ref> The love poems were published posthumously in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 1''.<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Karl |last1=Marx |author1-link=Karl Marx |first2=Friedrich |last2=Engels |author2-link=Friedrich Engels |title=Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels |volume=1 |location=New York |publisher=International Publishers |date=1975 |pages=531–632}}</ref> Marx soon abandoned fiction for other pursuits, including the study of both English and Italian, [[art history]] and the translation of Latin classics.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=25–26}}.</ref> He began co-operating with [[Bruno Bauer]] on editing Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion|Philosophy of Religion]]'' in 1840.

It was described as "a daring and original piece of work in which Marx set out to show that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy".<ref>{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=32}}.</ref> The essay was controversial, particularly among the conservative professors at the University of Berlin.

=== Paris: 1843–1845 ===
In 1843, Marx became co-editor of a new, radical left-wing Parisian newspaper, the {{lang|de|[[Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher]]}} (''German-French Annals''), then being set up by the German activist [[Arnold Ruge]] to bring together German and French radicals.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=68–69, 72}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=48}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=59–61}}</ref> Therefore Marx and his wife moved to Paris in October 1843.

[[File:Engels 1856.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Engels]], whom Marx met in 1844; the two became lifelong friends and collaborators.]]

On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist [[Friedrich Engels]] at the [[Café de la Régence]], beginning a lifelong friendship.{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=75}} Engels showed Marx his recently published ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Mansel |first=Philip |title=Paris Between Empires |page=390 |publisher=[[St. Martins Press]] |location=New York |date=2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Friedrich |last=Engels |author-link=Friedrich Engels |chapter=[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]] |title=Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels |volume=4 |publisher=International Publishers |location=New York |date=1975 |pages=295–596}}</ref> convincing Marx that the working class would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history.<ref name="Bottomore1991"/>{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=82}} Soon, Marx and Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, [[Bruno Bauer]]. This work was published in 1845 as ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''.{{sfn|Wheen|2001|pp=85–86}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Marx |first=Karl |author-link=Karl Marx |chapter=The Holy Family |title=Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels |volume=4 |publisher=International Publishers |location=New York |date=1975 |pages=3–211}}</ref> Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by the ideas of the Young Hegelians [[Max Stirner]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.<ref name="et"/>

During the time that he lived at 38 Rue Vaneau in Paris (from October 1843 until January 1845),<ref>Taken from the caption of a picture of the house in a group of pictures located between pages 160 and 161 of {{harvnb|Fedoseyev|1973}}.</ref> Marx engaged in an intensive study of [[political economy]] ([[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]], ''etc.'')'',''{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=63}} the French socialists (especially [[Henri de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri St. Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]){{sfn|Berlin|1963|pp=90–94}} and the history of France.{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=62}} The study of, and critique, of political economy is a project that Marx would pursue for the rest of his life<ref>Larisa Miskievich, "Preface" to Volume 28 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) p. xii</ref> and would result in his major economic work{{mdash}}the three-volume series called ''Das Kapital''.<ref>Karl Marx, ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', ''Volume 36'' and ''Volume 37'' (International Publishers: New York, 1996, 1997 and 1987).</ref> [[Marxism]] is based in large part on three influences: Hegel's dialectics, French utopian socialism and British political economy. Together with his earlier study of Hegel's dialectics, the studying that Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of "Marxism" were in place by the autumn of 1844.{{sfn|Berlin|1963|pp=35–61}} Marx was constantly being pulled away from his critique of political economy{{mdash}}not only by the usual daily demands of the time, but additionally by editing a radical newspaper and later by organising and directing the efforts of a political party during years of potentially revolutionary popular uprisings of the citizenry. Still, Marx was always drawn back to his studies where he sought "to understand the inner workings of capitalism".{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=62}}

An outline of "Marxism" had definitely formed in the mind of Karl Marx by late 1844. Indeed, many features of the Marxist view of the world had been worked out in great detail, but Marx needed to write down all of the details of his world view to further clarify the new critique of political economy in his own mind.<ref>Note 54 contained on p. 598 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3''.</ref> Accordingly, Marx wrote ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts]]''.<ref>Karl Marx, "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844" ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 229–346.</ref> These manuscripts covered numerous topics, detailing Marx's concept of [[alienated labour]].<ref name=sep/> By the spring of 1845, his continued study of political economy, capital and capitalism had led Marx to the belief that the new critique of political economy he was espousing—that of [[scientific socialism]]—needed to be built on the base of a thoroughly developed materialistic view of the world.{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=83}}

The ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'' had been written between April and August 1844, but soon Marx recognised that the ''Manuscripts'' had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach. Accordingly, Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism, thus a year later (in April 1845) after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]".<ref>Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 3–14.</ref> The "Theses on Feuerbach" are best known for Thesis 11, which states that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, the point is to change it".<ref name=sep/><ref>Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach," contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'', p. 8.</ref> This work contains Marx's criticism of [[materialism]] (for being contemplative), [[idealism]] (for reducing practice to theory), and, overall, philosophy (for putting abstract reality above the physical world).<ref name=sep/> It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's [[historical materialism]], an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice.<ref name=sep/><ref name="Engels1999"/> In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down {{lang|de|Vorwärts!}}, with the interior minister, [[François Guizot]], expelling Marx from France.{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3KOyuSakn80C&pg=PA90 90]}}

=== Brussels: 1845–1848 ===
Unable either to stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845. However, to stay in Belgium he had to pledge not to publish anything on the subject of contemporary politics.{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3KOyuSakn80C&pg=PA90 90]}} In Brussels, Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including [[Moses Hess]], [[Karl Heinzen]] and [[Joseph Weydemeyer]]. In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels.{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3KOyuSakn80C&pg=PA90 90]}}<ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild ["New Book Publishing House"]: Dresden, 1972) p. 101</ref> Later, [[Mary Burns]], Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels in Brussels.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'', p. 102.</ref>

In mid-July 1845, Marx and Engels left Brussels for England to visit the leaders of the [[Chartism|Chartists]], a working-class movement in Britain. This was Marx's first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip. Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842<ref>Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild [New Book Publishing House]: Dresden, 1972) p. 53</ref> to August 1844.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'', p. 78.</ref> Not only did Engels already know the English language,{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=89}} but he had also developed a close relationship with many Chartist leaders.{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=89}} Indeed, Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers.{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=89}} Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=92}}

In collaboration with Engels, Marx also set about writing a book which is often seen as his best treatment of the concept of [[historical materialism]], ''[[The German Ideology]]''.<ref>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "German Ideology" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 19–539.</ref> In this work, Marx broke with [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Bruno Bauer]], [[Max Stirner]] and the rest of the Young Hegelians, while he also broke with [[Karl Theodor Ferdinand Grün|Karl Grün]] and other "true socialists" whose philosophies were still based in part on "[[idealism]]". In ''German Ideology'', Marx and Engels finally completed their philosophy, which was based solely on materialism as the sole motor force in history.{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|pp=96–97}} ''German Ideology'' is written in a humorously satirical form, but even this satirical form did not save the work from censorship. Like so many other early writings of his, ''German Ideology'' would not be published in Marx's lifetime and was published only in 1932.<ref name="sep"/><ref name="wk"/>{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=93}}

After completing ''German Ideology'', Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding "the theory and tactics" of a truly "revolutionary proletarian movement" operating from the standpoint of a truly "scientific materialist" philosophy.<ref>See Note 71 on p. 672 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976).</ref> This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at a time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend, on most occasions, to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors he called the book ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1847)<ref>Karl Marx, ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 105–212.</ref> and offered it as a response to the "petty-bourgeois philosophy" of the French anarchist socialist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as expressed in his book ''[[The Philosophy of Poverty]]'' (1840).{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=107}}

[[File:Marx+Family and Engels.jpg|thumb|Marx with his daughters and Engels]]

These books laid the foundation for Marx and Engels's most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. While residing in Brussels in 1846, Marx continued his association with the secret radical organisation [[League of the Just]].{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=124}} As noted above, Marx thought the League to be just the sort of radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about a working-class revolution.<ref>Note 260 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 671–72.</ref> However, to organise the working class into a mass movement the League had to cease its "secret" or "underground" orientation and operate in the open as a political party.<ref>Note 260 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'', p. 672.</ref> Members of the League eventually became persuaded in this regard. Accordingly, in June 1847 the League was reorganised by its membership into a new open "above ground" political society that appealed directly to the working classes.{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|pp=123–125}} This new open political society was called the Communist League.{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=125}} Both Marx and Engels participated in drawing up the programme and organisational principles of the new [[Communist League]].<ref>Frederick Engels, "Principles of Communism" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers, New York, 1976) pp. 341–57.</ref>

[[File:Communist-manifesto.png|thumb|left|upright|The first edition of ''[[The Communist Manifesto|The Manifesto of the Communist Party]]'', published in German in 1848]]

In late 1847, Marx and Engels began writing what was to become their most famous work&nbsp;– a programme of action for the [[Communist League]]. Written jointly by Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' was first published on 21 February 1848.<ref>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "The Communist Manifesto" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'', pp. 477–519.</ref> ''The Communist Manifesto'' laid out the beliefs of the new Communist League. No longer a secret society, the Communist League wanted to make aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding its beliefs as the League of the Just had been doing.{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=115}} The opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Marxism: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".<ref name="ShillingMellor2001">{{cite book |first1=Chris |last1=Shilling |first2=Philip A. |last2=Mellor |title=The Sociological Ambition: Elementary Forms of Social and Moral Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CdgJe9Jx0UC&pg=PA114 |year=2001 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=978-0-7619-6549-7 |page=114 |access-date=27 June 2015 |archive-date=15 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915145130/https://books.google.com/books?id=1CdgJe9Jx0UC&pg=PA114 |url-status=live |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> It goes on to examine the antagonisms that Marx claimed were arising in the clashes of interest between the [[bourgeoisie]] (the wealthy capitalist class) and the [[proletariat]] (the industrial working class). Proceeding on from this, the ''Manifesto'' presents the argument for why the Communist League, as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting in the interests of the proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and to replace it with socialism.<ref>[[#Mar48|Marx and Engels 1848]].</ref>

Later that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions, and often violent upheavals that became known as the [[Revolutions of 1848]].{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=125}} In France, [[French Revolution of 1848|a revolution]] led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the [[French Second Republic]].{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=125}} Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father (withheld by his uncle Lionel Philips since his father's death in 1838) of either 6,000<ref name="MaltsevN.-93"/> or 5,000 francs<ref>{{cite book |first=Saul Kussiel |last=Padover |title=Karl Marx, an intimate biography |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |date=1978 |page=205}}</ref>{{sfn|Wheen|2001|pp=126–27}} he allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action.{{sfn|Wheen|2001|pp=126–27}} Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed,<ref name="MaltsevN.-93"/><ref>David McLellan 1973 ''Karl Marx: His life and Thought''.

Temporarily settling down in Paris, Marx transferred the Communist League executive headquarters to the city and also set up a [[German Workers' Society|German Workers' Club]] with various German socialists living there.{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=128}} Hoping to see the revolution spread to Germany, in 1848 Marx moved back to Cologne where he began issuing a handbill entitled the ''Demands of the Communist Party in Germany'',<ref>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "Demands of the Communist Party" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 7'' (International Publishers: New York, 1977) pp. 3–6.</ref> in which he argued for only four of the ten points of the ''Communist Manifesto'', believing that in Germany at that time the bourgeoisie must overthrow the [[feudalism|feudal]] monarchy and aristocracy before the proletariat could overthrow the bourgeoisie.{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=129}} On 1 June, Marx started the publication of a daily newspaper, the {{lang|de|[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]}}, which he helped to finance through his recent inheritance from his father.

Marx moved to London in early June 1849 and would remain based in the city for the rest of his life. The headquarters of the Communist League also moved to London. However, in the winter of 1849–1850, a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by [[August Willich]] and [[Karl Schapper]] began agitating for an immediate uprising. Willich and Schapper believed that once the Communist League had initiated the uprising, the entire working class from across Europe would rise "spontaneously" to join it, thus creating revolution across Europe. Marx and Engels protested that such an unplanned uprising on the part of the Communist League was "adventuristic" and would be suicide for the Communist League.{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=233}} Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe. Marx maintained that this would spell doom for the Communist League itself, arguing that changes in society are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of a handful of men.{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=233}} They are instead brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development. In the present stage of development (''circa'' 1850), following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848 he felt that the Communist League should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms, such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal (male) suffrage. In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working-class agenda and a working-class revolution.{{cn|date=August 2024}}

After a long struggle that threatened to ruin the Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually, the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society.<ref>Note 269 contained on p. 674 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11''.</ref> The Society held their meetings in [[Great Windmill Street]], [[Soho]], central London's entertainment district.{{sfn|Wheen|2001|pp=151–155}}<ref name="Harriss2006"/> This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.<ref>Note 269 on p. 674 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11''.</ref>

The ''New-York Daily Tribune'' had been founded in April 1841 by [[Horace Greeley]].{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=274}} Its editorial board contained progressive bourgeois journalists and publishers, among them [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] and the journalist [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles Dana]], who was editor-in-chief.

On 21 March 1857, Dana informed Marx that due to the economic recession only one article a week would be paid for, published or not; the others would be paid for only if published. Marx had sent his articles on Tuesdays and Fridays, but, that October, the ''Tribune'' discharged all its correspondents in Europe except Marx and B. Taylor, and reduced Marx to a weekly article. Between September and November 1860, only five were published. After a six-month interval, Marx resumed contributions from September 1861 until March 1862, when Dana wrote to inform him that there was no longer space in the ''Tribune'' for reports from London, due to American domestic affairs.<ref name="MECW">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/MarxEngelsCollectedWorksVolume10MKarlMarx|title=Marx & Engels Collected Works, vol.41|date=15 March 2017}}</ref> In 1868, Dana set up a rival newspaper, the ''New York Sun'', at which he was editor-in-chief.<ref>Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'' (Alfred A.

The 1850s and 1860s may be said to mark a philosophical boundary distinguishing the [[young Marx]]'s [[Hegelian]] [[idealism]] and the more [[mature Marx]]'s<ref name="Wood"/><ref name="Wood1993"/><ref name="Hook1994"/><ref name="Johnston2000"/> scientific ideology associated with [[structural Marxism]].<ref name="Johnston2000"/> However, not all scholars accept this distinction.<ref name="Hook1994"/><ref name="GeorgeScanlan1975"/> For Marx and Engels, their experience of the [[Revolutions of 1848]] to 1849 were formative in the development of their theory of economics and historical progression. After the "failures" of 1848, the revolutionary impetus appeared spent and not to be renewed without an economic recession. Contention arose between Marx and his fellow communists, whom he denounced as "adventurists". Marx deemed it fanciful to propose that "will power" could be sufficient to create the revolutionary conditions when in reality the economic component was the necessary requisite. The recession in the United States' economy in 1852 gave Marx and Engels grounds for optimism for revolutionary activity, yet this economy was seen as too immature for a capitalist revolution. Open territories on America's western frontier dissipated the forces of social unrest. Moreover, any economic crisis arising in the United States would not lead to revolutionary contagion of the older economies of individual European nations, which were closed systems bounded by their national borders. When the so-called [[Panic of 1857]] in the United States spread globally, it broke all economic theory models, and was the first truly global economic crisis.<ref>Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 320.</ref>

=== First International and ''Das Kapital'' ===
[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich Das Kapital Marx 1867.jpg|thumb|upright|The first volume of ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]]'']]

Marx continued to write articles for the ''New York Daily Tribune'' as long as he was sure that the ''Tribune''{{'}}s editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy.<ref>Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 347.</ref> No longer was the ''Tribune'' to be a strong [[abolitionist]] paper dedicated to a complete [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the ''Tribune''.{{sfn|Fedoseyev|1973|p=345}}

In 1864, Marx became involved in the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (also known as the First International),{{sfn|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|2007|p=[https://web.archive.org/web/20130622083426/http://books.google.com/books?id=4rbH49xtcpkC&pg=PA192 192]}} to whose General Council he was elected at its inception in 1864.{{sfn|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|2007|p=[https://web.archive.org/web/20130616235612/http://books.google.com/books?id=4rbH49xtcpkC&pg=PA269 267]}} In that organisation, Marx was involved in the struggle against the anarchist wing centred on [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814–1876).{{r|egsbio}} Although Marx won this contest, the transfer of the seat of the General Council from London to New York in 1872, which Marx supported, led to the decline of the International.<ref name="JessopWheatley1999-526"/> The most important political event during the existence of the International was the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 when the citizens of Paris rebelled against their government and held the city for two months. In response to the bloody suppression of this rebellion, Marx wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, "[[The Civil War in France]]", a defence of the Commune.<ref name="Curtis1997"/><ref>Karl Marx, "The Civil War in France" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 22'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) pp. 307–59.</ref>

Given the repeated failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx also sought to understand and provide a critique suitable for the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], and hence spent a great deal of time in the reading room of the [[British Museum]] studying.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|p=20}} By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, [[landed property]], wage labour, the state, and foreign trade, and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939, under the title ''[[Grundrisse|Grundrisse der Kritik der Politischen Ökonomie]]'' ({{langx|en|Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy}}).<ref name="Segrest2002"/><ref>Karl Marx, "Economic Manuscripts of 1857–1858" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 28'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) pp. 5–537.</ref><ref>Karl Marx, "Economic Manuscripts of 1857–1858" contained in the Preparatory Materials section of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'' (International Publishers: New York, 1987) pp. 421–507.</ref>

In 1859, Marx published ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'',<ref>Karl Marx, "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', pp. 257–417.</ref> his first serious critique of political economy.

The prophets of the eighteenth century, on whose shoulders Adam Smith and Ricardo were still wholly standing, envisaged this 18th-century individual – a product of the dissolution of feudal society on the one hand and of the new productive forces evolved since the sixteenth century on the other – as an ideal whose existence belonged to the past.

The successful sales of ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' stimulated Marx in the early 1860s to finish work on the three large volumes that would compose his major life's work&nbsp;– {{lang|de|Das Kapital}} and the ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', which discussed and critiqued the theoreticians of political economy, particularly [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]].{{r|egsbio}} ''Theories of Surplus Value'' is often referred to as the fourth volume of {{lang|de|Das Kapital}} and constitutes one of the first comprehensive treatises on the [[history of economic thought]].<ref name="Rockmore2002"/> In 1867, the first volume of {{lang|de|Das Kapital}} was published, a work which critically analysed capital.<ref name="BrewerMarx1984-15"/><ref name=":0" /> {{lang|de|Das Kapital}} proposes an explanation of the "laws of motion" of the [[mode of production]] from its origins to its future by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital, with topics such as the growth of [[wage labour]], the transformation of the workplace, [[capital accumulation]], competition, the [[banking]] system, the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] and land-rents, as well as how waged labour continually reproduce the rule of capital.{{sfn|Postone|2006|pp=190, 26–27. 135, 374–75}}{{sfn|Calhoun|2012}}{{sfn|Pepperell|2010|pp=104–105}} Marx proposes that the driving force of capital is in the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of [[Labour (economics)|labour]], whose unpaid work is the ultimate source of [[surplus value]].

Demand for a Russian language edition of {{lang|de|Das Kapital}} soon led to the printing of 3,000 copies of the book in the Russian language, which was published on 27 March 1872. By the autumn of 1871, the entire first edition of the German-language edition of {{lang|de|Das Kapital}} had been sold out and a second edition was published.

Volumes II and III of {{lang|de|Das Kapital}} remained mere manuscripts upon which Marx continued to work for the rest of his life.

[[File:Marx old.jpg|thumb|upright|Marx in 1882]]

During the last decade of his life, Marx's health declined, and he became incapable of the sustained effort that had characterised his previous work.{{r|egsbio}} He did manage to comment substantially on contemporary politics, particularly in Germany and Russia. His ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'' opposed the tendency of his followers [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and [[August Bebel]] to compromise with the [[state socialism|state socialist]] ideas of [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] in the interests of a united socialist party.{{r|egsbio}} This work is also notable for another famous Marx quote: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".<ref name="CGP P1"/>

In a letter to [[Vera Zasulich]] dated 8 March 1881, Marx contemplated the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village ''[[mir (social)|mir]]''.{{r|egsbio}}<ref>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Collected Works Volume 46'' (International Publishers: New York, 1992) p. 71.</ref> While admitting that Russia's rural "commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia", Marx also warned that in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage it "would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it [the rural commune] from all sides".<ref name="k72"/> Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Marx allowed that "normal conditions of spontaneous development" of the rural commune could exist.<ref name=k72/> However, in the same letter to Vera Zasulich he points out that "at the core of the capitalist system&nbsp;... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production".<ref name=k72/> In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past. He wrote that "the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type&nbsp;– collective production and appropriation". He added that "the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, etc. societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies".<ref>K. Marx, First draft of the letter to Vera Zasulich [1881]. In Marx-Engels 'Collected Works', Volume 24, p. 346.</ref> Before he died, Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]''.

Marx was afflicted by poor health, what he himself described as "the wretchedness of existence",{{sfn|Blumenberg|2000|p=98}} and various authors have sought to describe and explain it. His biographer Werner Blumenberg attributed it to liver and gall problems which Marx had in 1849 and from which he was never afterward free, exacerbated by an unsuitable lifestyle. The attacks often came with headaches, eye inflammation, [[neuralgia]] in the head, and rheumatic pains. A serious nervous disorder appeared in 1877 and protracted [[insomnia]] was a consequence, which Marx fought with narcotics.{{sfn|Blumenberg|2000|p=100}}

The illness was aggravated by excessive nocturnal work and faulty diet. Marx was fond of highly seasoned dishes, smoked fish, caviare, pickled cucumbers, "none of which are good for liver patients", but he also liked wine and liqueurs and smoked an enormous amount "and since he had no money, it was usually bad-quality cigars". From 1863, Marx complained a lot about boils: "These are very frequent with liver patients and may be due to the same causes".{{sfn|Blumenberg|2000|p=100}} The abscesses were so bad that Marx could neither sit nor work upright. According to Blumenberg, Marx's irritability is often found in liver patients:

<blockquote>The illness emphasised certain traits in his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had blind faith in his closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence&nbsp;... There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this&nbsp;... not even Engels was an exception.{{sfn|Blumenberg|2000|pp=99–100}}</blockquote>

According to Princeton historian [[Jerrold Seigel]], in his late teens, Marx may have had pneumonia or pleurisy, the effects of which led to his being exempted from Prussian military service. In later life whilst working on {{lang|de|Das Kapital}} (which he never completed),{{sfn|Blumenberg|2000|p=98}}{{sfn|Seigel|1978|p=494}} Marx suffered from a trio of afflictions. A liver ailment, probably hereditary, was aggravated by overwork, a bad diet, and lack of sleep. Inflammation of the eyes was induced by too much work at night. A third affliction, eruption of carbuncles or boils, "was probably brought on by general physical debility to which the various features of Marx's style of life&nbsp;– alcohol, tobacco, poor diet, and failure to sleep&nbsp;– all contributed. Engels often exhorted Marx to alter this dangerous regime". In Seigel's thesis, what lay behind this punishing sacrifice of his health may have been guilt about self-involvement and egoism, originally induced in Karl Marx by his father.{{sfn|Seigel|1978|pp=495–496}}

In 2007, a [[retrodiagnosis]] of Marx's skin disease was made by [[dermatologist]] Sam Shuster of [[Newcastle University]] and for Shuster, the most probable explanation was that Marx suffered not from liver problems, but from [[hidradenitis suppurativa]], a recurring infective condition arising from blockage of [[apocrine]] ducts opening into [[hair follicles]]. This condition, which was not described in the English medical literature until 1933 (hence would not have been known to Marx's physicians), can produce joint pain (which could be misdiagnosed as rheumatic disorder) and painful eye conditions.{{sfn|Shuster|2008|pp=1–2}}

To arrive at his retrodiagnosis, Shuster considered the primary material: the Marx correspondence published in the 50 volumes of the ''Marx/Engels Collected Works''. There, "although the skin lesions were called 'furuncles', 'boils' and 'carbuncles' by Marx, his wife, and his physicians, they were too persistent, recurrent, destructive and site-specific for that diagnosis". The sites of the persistent 'carbuncles' were noted repeatedly in the armpits, groins, [[perianal]], [[genital]] ([[Human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]]) and [[suprapubic]] regions and inner thighs, "favoured sites of hidradenitis suppurativa". Professor Shuster claimed the diagnosis "can now be made definitively".{{sfn|Shuster|2008|pp=1–2}}

Shuster went on to consider the potential [[psychosocial]] effects of the disease, noting that the skin is an organ of communication and that hidradenitis suppurativa produces much psychological distress, including loathing and disgust and depression of self-image, mood, and well-being, feelings for which Shuster found "much evidence" in the Marx correspondence. Professor Shuster went on to ask himself whether the mental effects of the disease affected Marx's work and even helped him to develop [[Marx's theory of alienation|his theory of alienation]].{{sfn|Shuster|2008|p=3}}

=== Death ===
[[File:Grave of Karl Marx Highgate Cemetery in London 2016 (10).jpg|thumb|[[Tomb of Karl Marx]], East [[Highgate Cemetery]], London]]

Following the death of his wife Jenny in December 1881, Marx developed a [[catarrh]] that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life. It eventually brought on the [[bronchitis]] and [[pleurisy]] that killed him in London on 14 March 1883, when he died a [[Statelessness|stateless person]] at age 64.<ref name="stateless"/> Family and friends in London buried his body in [[Highgate Cemetery]] (East), London, on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists. For example, [[George Eliot]]'s grave is nearby. According to [[Francis Wheen]], there were between nine and eleven mourners at his funeral.{{sfn|Wheen|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3KOyuSakn80C&pg=PA382 382]}}<ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/> Research from contemporary sources identifies thirteen named individuals attending the funeral: [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Eleanor Marx]], [[Edward Aveling]], [[Paul Lafargue]], [[Charles Longuet]], [[Helene Demuth]], [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], Gottlieb Lemke, [[Frederick Lessner]], G Lochner, Sir [[Ray Lankester]], [[Carl Schorlemmer]] and [[Ernest Radford]].<ref>John Shepperd, 'Who was really at Marx's funeral?', in "Friends of Highgate Cemetery Newsletter ", April (2018), pp. 10–11. https://highgatecemetery.org/uploads/2018-04_Newsletter_final_web.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204074940/https://highgatecemetery.org/uploads/2018-04_Newsletter_final_web.pdf |date=4 February 2020 }}</ref> A contemporary newspaper account claims that twenty-five to thirty relatives and friends attended the funeral.<ref>'Dr Karl Marx', in ''[[The Sunday People|The People]]'', 25 March 1883, p.3.</ref> 

A writer in ''[[The Graphic]]'' noted: 'By a strange blunder ... his death was not announced for two days, and then as having taken place at Paris. The next day the correction came from Paris; and when his friends and followers hastened to his house in [[Haverstock Hill]], to learn the time and place of burial, they learned that he was already in the cold ground. But for this secresy [sic] and haste, a great popular demonstration would undoubtedly have been held over his grave'.<ref>'Dr Karl Marx' in ''The Graphic'', 31 March 1883, pp. 319, 322</ref>

Several of his closest friends spoke at his funeral, including [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and Friedrich Engels. Engels' speech included the passage: {{blockquote|On the 14th&nbsp;of March, at a quarter to three in the afternoon, the greatest living thinker ceased to think.

Lochner, whom Engels described as "an old member of the Communist League"; and [[Carl Schorlemmer]], a professor of chemistry in Manchester, a member of the [[Royal Society]], and a communist activist involved in the 1848 [[Revolution in Baden|Baden revolution]].<ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/> Another attendee of the funeral was [[Ray Lankester]], a British zoologist who would later become a prominent academic.<ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/>

The Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] remarked: "One cannot say Marx died a failure." Although he had not achieved a large following of disciples in Britain, his writings had already begun to make an impact on the left-wing movements in Germany and Russia. Within twenty-five years of his death, the continental European socialist parties that acknowledged Marx's influence on their politics had contributed to significant gains in their [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] elections.<ref>[[#Hob11|Hobsbawm 2011]]. pp. 3–4.</ref>

== Thought ==
{{Marxism}}

=== Influences ===
{{Main|Influences on Karl Marx}}
Marx's thought demonstrates influence from many sources, including but not limited to:
* [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s philosophy{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=20–23}}
* The classical political economy (economics) of Adam Smith and [[David Ricardo]],<ref name="Sherman1995"/> as well as [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]]'s critique of laissez-faire economics and analysis of the precarious state of the proletariat<ref name="Paresh">{{cite book |last1=Chattopadhyay |first1=Paresh |title=Marx's Associated Mode of Production: A Critique of Marxism |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |pages=39–41}}</ref>
* [[History of the Left in France|French socialist thought]],<ref name="Sherman1995"/> in particular the thought of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]<ref name="Beilharz1992"/>{{sfn|Clark|1998|pp=57–59}}
* Earlier German philosophical materialism among the [[Young Hegelians]], particularly that of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Bruno Bauer]],<ref name=et/> as well as the French materialism of the late 18th century, including [[Diderot]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] and [[d'Holbach]]
* [[Friedrich Engels|Friedrich Engels']] analysis of the working class,<ref name="Bottomore1991"/> as well as the early descriptions of class provided by French liberals and Saint-Simonians such as [[François Guizot]] and [[Augustin Thierry]]
* Marx's Judaic legacy has been identified as formative to both his moral outlook<ref>Eagleton, Terry. ''[[Why Marx Was Right]]''. Yale University Press, 2011, p. 158</ref> and his materialist philosophy.{{sfn|Seigel|1978|pp=112–119}}

Marx's view of history, which came to be called [[historical materialism]] (controversially adapted as the philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]] by Engels and Lenin), certainly shows the influence of Hegel's claim that one should view reality (and history) [[dialectic]]ally.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=20–23}} However, whereas Hegel had thought in [[idealist]] terms, putting ideas in the forefront, Marx sought to conceptualise dialectics in [[materialist]] terms, arguing for the primacy of matter over idea.<ref name=sep/>{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=20–23}} 

Where Hegel saw the "spirit" as driving history, Marx saw this as an unnecessary mystification, obscuring the reality of humanity and its physical actions shaping the world.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=20–23}} He wrote that Hegelianism stood the movement of reality on its head, and that one needed to set it upon its feet.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=20–23}} Despite his dislike of mystical terms, Marx used [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] language in several of his works: in ''The Communist Manifesto'' he proclaims "A spectre is haunting Europe&nbsp;– the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre", and in ''The Capital'' he refers to capital as "[[necromancy]] that surrounds the products of labour".<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/OPE/archive/0604/att-0138/01-PoliticalEconOfTheDead.pdf |first=Mark |last=Neocleous |title=The Political Economy of the Dead: Marx's Vampires |access-date=1 November 2013 |archive-date=12 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412205331/http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/OPE/archive/0604/att-0138/01-PoliticalEconOfTheDead.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

Though inspired by French socialist and sociological thought,<ref name="Sherman1995"/> Marx criticised [[utopian socialists]], arguing that their favoured small-scale socialistic communities would be bound to marginalisation and poverty and that only a large-scale change in the [[economic system]] could bring about real change.{{sfn|Clark|1998|pp=57–59}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leopold |first1=David |title=Marx, Engels, and Some (Non-Foundational) Arguments against Utopian Socialism |url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ba0c49a8-6592-4961-9d54-3a805c564272/files/m1c8aee21e160b7ea7c6e728719ba7a69 |website=ORA - Oxford University Research Archive |access-date=August 22, 2024 |archive-date=22 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240822025856/https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ba0c49a8-6592-4961-9d54-3a805c564272/files/m1c8aee21e160b7ea7c6e728719ba7a69 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Other important contributions to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of [[class conflict]] and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution,<ref name="Bottomore1991"/> as well as from the social democrat [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schulz]], who in {{lang|de|Die Bewegung der Produktion}} described the movement of society as "flowing from the contradiction between the forces of production and the mode of production."<ref name="Levine">{{cite book |last1=Levine |first1=Norman |title=Divergent Paths: The Hegelian foundations of Marx's method |date=2006 |publisher=[[Lexington Books]] |page=223}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated144">{{cite book|first=Jonathan |last=Sperber |author-link=Jonathan Sperber |title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life |page=144}}</ref>

Marx believed that he could study history and society scientifically, discerning tendencies of history and thereby predicting the outcome of social conflicts. Some followers of Marx, therefore, concluded that a communist revolution would inevitably occur. However, Marx famously asserted in the eleventh of his "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]" that "philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point however is to change it" and he clearly dedicated himself to trying to alter the world.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=23–24}}<ref name="wh1"/>

Marx's theories inspired several theories and disciplines of future, including but not limited to:
* [[Critique of political economy|Contemporary critique of political economy]]
* [[Kondratiev wave]] and [[Kuznets swing]]
* Theory of [[Underconsumption]]
* [[Creative destruction]]
* [[Crisis theory]]
* [[Quantitative Economic History]]
* [[World-systems theory]]

=== Philosophy and social thought ===
Marx has been called "the first great user of [[critical method]] in social sciences", a characterisation stemming from his frequent use of [[polemic]]s throughout his work to effect critiques of other thinkers.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=20–23}}<ref name="Sherman1995"/> He criticised speculative philosophy, equating [[metaphysics]] with ideology.{{sfn|Bannerji|2001|p=27}}<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Paolucci |first1=Paul |title=Marx's scientific and political criticism: The internal relation |journal=Capital & Class |year=2015|volume=39 |pages=65–78 |doi=10.1177/0309816814564657 }}</ref> By adopting this approach, Marx attempted to separate key findings from ideological biases.<ref name="Sherman1995"/> This set him apart from many contemporary philosophers.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=23–24}}

For both Marx and Hegel, self-development begins with an experience of internal [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] stemming from this recognition, followed by a realisation that the actual self, as a [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] agent, renders its potential counterpart an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] to be apprehended.<ref name="Marx_critique"/> Marx further argues that by moulding nature<ref name = "Lefever">See also Lefever DM; Lefever JT (1977).

Marx thus departs from Hegel by insisting that "the fact that man is a corporeal, actual, sentient, objective being with natural capacities means that he has actual, sensuous objects for his nature as objects of his life-expression, or that he can only express his life in actual sensuous objects".<ref name = "Marx_objects">Marx (1997), p. 325, emphasis in original.</ref> Consequently, Marx revises Hegelian "work" into material "[[labour (economics)|labour]]" and in the context of human capacity to transform nature the term "[[labour power]]".<ref name=sep/>

[[File:Marx et Engels à Shanghai.jpg|upright|thumb|A monument dedicated to Marx and Engels in [[Shanghai]], China]]

Marx had a special concern with how people relate to their own labour power.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|p=22}} He wrote extensively about this in terms of the problem of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]].{{sfn|Mészáros|2006|p=96}} As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|p=22}} [[Capitalism]] mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|p=22}} For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour&nbsp;– one's capacity to transform the world&nbsp;– is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|p=22}} Marx described this loss as [[commodity fetishism]], in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.<ref name="Balibar1995"/>

[[Commodity fetishism]] provides an example of what Engels called "[[false consciousness]]",<ref name="KołakowskiFalla2005">{{cite book|first1=Leszek |last1=Kołakowski |author-link1=Leszek Kołakowski |first2=Paul Stephen |last2=Falla |title=Main currents of Marxism: the founders, the golden age, the breakdown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUCxpznbkaoC&pg=PA226 |access-date=8 March 2011 |year=2005 |publisher=[[W.W.

Marx's thoughts on labour and its function in reproducing capital were related to the primacy he gave to social relations in determining the society's past, present and future.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=20–23}}<ref name="Turner2005"/><ref name=":1">{{cite web |last=Marx |first=Karl |title=Grundrisse 06 |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch06.htm |access-date=21 November 2021 |website=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |quote=the demand that wage labour be continued but capital suspended is self-contradictory, self-dissolving. |archive-date=21 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211121201428/https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch06.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Critics have called this [[economic determinism]]. Labour is the precondition for the existence of, and [[accumulation of capital]], which both shape the [[social system]].<ref name=":1" /> For Marx, [[social change]] was driven by conflict between opposing interests, by parties situated in the historical situation of their [[mode of production]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2012}} This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the [[conflict theory]].<ref name="Turner2005"/> 

In his [[sociocultural evolution|evolutionary]] model of history, he argued that [[human history]] began with free, productive and creative activities that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=20–23}} Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, but rather due to the immanent logic of the current [[mode of production]] which demands more human labour ([[Abstract labour and concrete labour|abstract labour]]) to reproduce the social relationships of capital.{{sfn|Postone|2006|pp=190, 26–27. 135, 374–75}}{{sfn|Pepperell|2010|pp=104–105}}

The organisation of society depends on [[means of production]]. The means of production are all things required to produce material goods, such as land, natural resources, and technology but not human labour. The [[relations of production]] are the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production.<ref name="Turner2005"/> Together, these compose the [[mode of production]] and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of modes of production. Marx differentiated between [[base and superstructure]], where the base (or substructure) is the [[economic system]] and superstructure is the cultural and political system.<ref name="Turner2005"/> Marx regarded this mismatch between economic base and social [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] as a major source of social disruption and conflict.<ref name="Turner2005"/>

Despite Marx's stress on the critique of capitalism and discussion of the new [[communist society]] that should replace it, his explicit critique is guarded, as he saw it as an improved society compared to the past ones ([[slavery]] and [[feudalism]]).<ref name=sep/> Marx never clearly discusses issues of [[morality]] and [[justice]], but scholars agree that his work contained [[Logical implication|implicit]] discussion of those concepts.<ref name=sep/>

Marx's view of capitalism was two-sided.<ref name=sep/><ref name="Wood1993"/> On one hand, in the 19th century's deepest critique of the dehumanising aspects of this system he noted that defining features of capitalism include alienation, exploitation and recurring, cyclical [[economic depression|depressions]] leading to mass unemployment. On the other hand, he characterised capitalism as "revolutionising, industrialising and universalising qualities of development, growth and progressivity" (by which Marx meant industrialisation, urbanisation, technological progress, increased [[productivity]] and growth, [[rationality]], and [[scientific revolution]]) that are responsible for progress, at in contrast to earlier forms of societies.<ref name=sep/><ref name="Wood1993"/>{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=20–23}} 

Marx considered the capitalist class to be one of the most revolutionary in history because it constantly improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history and was responsible for the overthrow of [[feudalism]].{{sfn|Clark|1998|pp=57–59}}<ref name="Gilbert2010" /> Capitalism can stimulate considerable growth because the capitalist has an incentive to reinvest profits in new technologies and [[capital equipment]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|p=22}}

According to Marx, capitalists take advantage of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference "[[surplus value]]" and argued that it was based on [[surplus labour]], the difference between what it costs to keep workers alive, and what they can produce.<ref name=sep/> Although Marx describes capitalists as [[vampire]]s sucking worker's blood,{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=20–23}} he notes that drawing profit is "by no means an injustice" since Marx, according to [[Allen W. Wood]] "excludes any trans-epochal standpoint from which one can comment" on the morals of such particular arrangements.<ref name=sep/> Marx also noted that even the capitalists themselves cannot go against the system.{{sfn|Clark|1998|pp=57–59}} The problem is the "cancerous cell" of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], understood not as property or equipment, but the social relations between workers and owners, (the selling and purchasing of labour power)&nbsp;– the societal system, or rather [[mode of production]], in general.{{sfn|Clark|1998|pp=57–59}}

At the same time, Marx stressed that capitalism was unstable and prone to [[crisis theory|periodic crises]].<ref name=wk/> He suggested that over time capitalists would invest more and more in new technologies and less and less in labour.<ref name=sep/> Since Marx believed that profit derived from surplus value appropriated from labour, he concluded that the rate of profit would fall as the economy grows.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|p=23}} Marx believed that increasingly severe crises would punctuate this [[business cycles|cycle]] of growth and collapse.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|p=23}} Moreover, he believed that in the long-term, this process would enrich and [[empowerment|empower]] the capitalist class and impoverish the proletariat.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|p=23}}{{sfn|Clark|1998|pp=57–59}} In section one of ''The Communist Manifesto'', Marx describes [[feudalism]], capitalism and the role internal social contradictions play in the historical process:

{{blockquote|We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged&nbsp;... the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder. Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it, and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class. A similar movement is going on before our own eyes&nbsp;... The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring order into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property.<ref name=manifesto/>}}

[[File:MandK Industrial Revolution 1900.jpg|thumb|Outside a factory in [[Oldham]], 1900. Marx believed that industrial workers, the [[proletariat]], would rise up around the world.]]

Marx believed that those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate its end, giving way to socialism, or a [[post-capitalism|post-capitalistic]], communist society:

{{blockquote|The development of modern industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.<ref name="manifesto"/>}}

Thanks to various processes overseen by capitalism, such as urbanisation, the working class, the proletariat, should grow in numbers and develop [[class consciousness]], in time realising that they can and must change the system.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=20–23}} Marx believed that if the proletariat were to seize the means of production, they would encourage social relations that would benefit everyone equally, abolishing the exploiting class and introducing a system of production less vulnerable to cyclical crises.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|pp=20–23}} Marx argued in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' that capitalism will end through the organised actions of an international working class: {{blockquote|Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality will have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.<ref name="Elster1985"/>|sign=|source=}}

In this new society, the alienation would end and humans would be free to act without being bound by selling their labour.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|p=23}} It would be a democratic society, enfranchising the entire population.{{sfn|Clark|1998|pp=57–59}} In such a [[utopia]]n world, there would also be little need for a state, whose goal was previously to enforce the alienation.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002|p=23}} Marx theorised that between capitalism and the establishment of a socialist/communist system, would exist a period of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]&nbsp;– where the working class holds political power and forcibly socialises the means of production.{{sfn|Clark|1998|pp=57–59}} As he wrote in his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'', "between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the [[communist revolution|revolutionary transformation]] of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat".<ref name="Karl Marx:Critique of the Gotha Programme"/> While he allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong [[democracy|democratic]] institutional structures (such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[United States]], and the [[Netherlands]]), he suggested that in other countries in which workers cannot "attain their goal by peaceful means" the "lever of our revolution must be force".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/09/08.htm La Liberté Speech] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716015355/https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/09/08.htm |date=16 July 2018 }} delivered by Karl Marx on 8 September 1872, in [[Amsterdam]].

This being the case, we must also recognise the fact that in most countries on the Continent the lever of our revolution must be force; it is force to which we must some day appeal to erect the rule of labour."</ref>

We know where the enemies of the revolution are concentrated, ''viz''. in Russia and the Slav regions of Austria, and no fine phrases, no allusions to an undefined democratic future for these countries can deter us from treating our enemies as enemies.

Marx and Engels sympathised with the [[Narodniks|Narodnik]] revolutionaries of the 1860s and 1870s. When the [[Narodnaya Volya|Russian revolutionaries]] assassinated Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], Marx expressed the hope that the assassination foreshadowed 'the formation of a Russian commune'.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels to the Chairman of the Slavonic Meeting, 21 March 1881.

{{blockquote|In the first place the policy of Russia is changeless... Its methods, its tactics, its manoeuvres may change, but the polar star of its policy – world domination – is a fixed star.

Marx supported the cause of [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish independence]]<!--The quote shows he meant more than Home Rule. He also seemed to be confusing England and Great Britain.-->. In 1867, he wrote Engels: "I used to think the separation of Ireland from England impossible. I now think it inevitable.

Marx spent some time in [[French Algeria]], which had been [[French conquest of Algeria|invaded]] and made a [[French colonial empire|French colony]] in 1830, and had the opportunity to observe life in colonial North Africa. He wrote about the colonial justice system, in which "a form of torture has been used (and this happens 'regularly') to extract confessions from the Arabs; naturally it is done (like the English in India) by the 'police'; the judge is supposed to know nothing at all about it."<ref name="alahram"/> Marx was surprised by the arrogance of many [[Pied-Noir|European settlers]] in Algiers and wrote in a letter: "when a European colonist dwells among the 'lesser breeds,' either as a settler or even on business, he generally regards himself as even more inviolable than handsome William I [a Prussian king]. Still, when it comes to bare-faced arrogance and presumptuousness vis-à-vis the 'lesser breeds,' the British and Dutch outdo the French."<ref name="alahram"/>

According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'': "Marx's analysis of colonialism as a progressive force bringing modernization to a backward feudal society sounds like a transparent rationalization for foreign domination. His account of British domination, however, reflects the same ambivalence that he shows towards capitalism in Europe. In both cases, Marx recognizes the immense suffering brought about during the transition from feudal to bourgeois society while insisting that the transition is both necessary and ultimately progressive. He argues that the penetration of foreign commerce will cause a social revolution in India."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Colonialism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year=2017 |access-date=10 August 2018 |archive-date=11 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611042603/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

From an academic perspective, Marx's work contributed to the birth of modern sociology.

Social theorists of the 20th and 21st centuries have pursued two main strategies in response to Marx. One move has been to reduce it to its analytical core, known as analytical Marxism. Another, more common move has been to dilute the explanatory claims of Marx's social theory and emphasise the "relative [[autonomy]]working-class agenda" of aspects of social and economic life not directly related to Marx's central narrative of interaction between the development of the "forces of production" and the succession of "modes of production". This has been the [[neo-Marxist]] theorising adopted by historians inspired by Marx's social theory such as [[E. P. Thompson]] and Eric Hobsbawm. It has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists such as [[Antonio Gramsci]] who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice, seen in the light of Marxist social theory.<ref>Kołakowski, Leszek.
