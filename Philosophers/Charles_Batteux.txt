==Biography==
Batteux was born in [[Alland'Huy-et-Sausseuil]], [[Ardennes]], and studied [[theology]] at [[Reims]]. In 1739 he came to [[Paris]], and after teaching in the colleges of [[Lisieux]] and [[Navarre]], was appointed to the chair of [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Roman philosophy]] in the [[Collège de France]]. 
His 1746 treatise ''Les beaux arts réduits à un même principe'' (translated into English as ''The Fine Arts Reduced to a Single Principle'', trans. James O. Young, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015) was an attempt to find a unity among existing theories of [[beauty]] and [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] on "a single principle", and its views were widely accepted,<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Batteux, Charles|volume=3|page=533}} This cites [[André Dacier|Dacier]] et Dupuy, ''Éloges'', in ''Mémoires de l'Académie des Inscriptions''.</ref> not only in France but throughout Europe.
 
According to [[Paul Oskar Kristeller|P. O. Kristeller]], {{blockquote|the decisive step towards the system of the fine arts [thereby to the modern idea, "fine art"] was taken by the Abbé Batteux in his famous and influential treatise ... [making him] the first to set forth a clearcut system of the fine arts in a treatise devoted entirely to this subject.<ref>[[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], "The Modern System of the Arts" (1951–1952), repr. in Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought and the Arts'' (New York: Harper & Row, 1965), pp. 163-227.</ref> }}

The reputation thus gained, confirmed by his translation of [[Horace]] (1750), led to Batteux's becoming a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions]] (1754) and of the [[Académie française]] (1761). His ''Cours de belles lettres'' (1765) was afterwards included with some minor writings in the large treatise, ''Principes de la littérature'' (1774). His philosophical writings were ''La morale d'Épicure tirée de ses propres écrits'' (1758), and the ''Histoire des causes premières'' (1769). In consequence of the freedom with which in this work he attacked the abuse of authority in philosophy, he lost his professorial chair. 
His last and most extensive work was a ''Cours d'études à l'usage des élèves de l'école militaire'' in forty-five volumes.<ref name=EB1911/>

In ''Les Beaux Arts'', Batteux developed a theory influenced by [[John Locke]] through [[Voltaire]]'s sceptical [[sensualism]]. He held that the [[fine arts]] are arts ("assemblages of rules for doing well"), for producing fine or beautiful things ("which please" of themselves), always "in imitation of ''la belle nature''" and requiring genius.  
Applying this principle to the art of [[poetry]], and analysing, line by line and even word by word, the works of great poets, he deduced the law that the beauty of poetry consists in the accuracy, beauty and harmony of individual expression. 
His ''Histoire des causes premières'' was among the first attempts at a history of philosophy, and in his work on [[Epicurus]], following on [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], he defended [[Epicureanism]] against the general attacks made against it.<ref name=EB1911/><br />
<br />
For his work "La Morale d'Épicure" [[1758]] 
see A. Toscano,“La Morale d’Épicure” di Charles Batteux ed il principio del “secondo natura”, in “Scienze e Ricerche” n. 42, 1 dicembre 2016, ISSN: 2283-5873, pp.&nbsp;20–29.

Strictly in Aesthetics terms Batteux sets the single principle for fine arts in imitation of nature, and this in terms of ideal of perfection to make a harmonious whole: "let's choose the most beautiful parts of nature, to make an exquisite whole, more perfect then nature, but never ending to be natural".<ref>Book I, part I: "à faire un choix des plus belles parties de la nature pour en former en tout exquis, qui fùt plus parfait que la nature elle-méme, sans cependant cesser d'étre naturel". See: TOSCANO A. (1991). Charles Batteux: Les Quatre Poëtiques. RIVISTA DI ESTETICA, vol. 39; p. 67-78, {{ISSN|0035-6212}}.</ref> In this concept, clearly, Batteux follows a long tradition, present at least in [[Leon Battista Alberti#Contributions|Leon Battista Alberti]]; as well as for the expression of fine arts, present in [[Giovanni Battista Armenini]] and more back in [[Sebastiano Serlio#Content|Sebastiano Serlio]].
