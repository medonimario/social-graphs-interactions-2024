'''Andrew Feenberg''' (born 1943) is an American philosopher. He holds the [[Canada Research Chairs|Canada Research Chair]] in the Philosophy of Technology in the School of Communication at [[Simon Fraser University]] in Vancouver.  His main interests are [[philosophy of technology]], [[continental philosophy]], [[critique of technology]] and [[science and technology studies]].

==Education==
Feenberg studied philosophy under [[Herbert Marcuse]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]] and was awarded his PhD in 1972.  During this time Feenberg was active in the [[New Left]], founding a journal entitled ''Alternatives'' and participating in the [[May 1968 in France|May '68]] events in Paris.

==Feenberg's philosophy of technology==
Compared to his predecessors in philosophy of technology, such as [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Jacques Ellul]] who have a dystopian view of technology, Feenberg's view is positive even though critical. For [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Jacques Ellul|Ellul]] technology affects people's life but is for the most part beyond their control. For Feenberg technology and society influence each other. He separates himself from the instrumentalists who view technology merely as instruments which are within humans' full control. 

Feenberg's primary contribution to the philosophy of technology is his argument for the democratic transformation of technology.  From his book ''Transforming Technology,''  
:"What human beings are and will become is decided in the shape of our tools no less than in the action of statesmen and political movements.  The design of technology is thus an ontological decision fraught with political consequences.  The exclusion of the vast majority from participation in this decision is profoundly undemocratic" (p.3).
Feenberg provides the theoretical foundation for this idea through the Critical Theory of Technology which he develops over three books: ''The Critical Theory of Technology'' (1991) (re-published as ''Transforming Technology: A Critical Theory Revisited''  [2002]), ''Alternative Modernity: The Technical Turn in Philosophy and Social Theory'' (1995), and ''Questioning Technology'' (1999). The basis of Feenberg's critical theory of technology is a concept of dialectical technological rationality he terms instrumentalization theory.  Instrumentalization theory combines the social critique of technology familiar from the philosophy of technology ([[Karl Marx]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jacques Ellul]]) with insights taken from the empirical case studies of [[science and technology studies]].  Applications of his theory include studies of online education, [[Minitel|the Minitel]], the Internet, and digital games.

Feenberg has also published books and articles on the philosophy of [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Marxist theory|Karl Marx]], [[György Lukács|Georg Lukacs]], and [[Kitaro Nishida|Kitarō Nishida]].
