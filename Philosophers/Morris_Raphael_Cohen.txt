Cohen was born in [[Minsk]], [[Imperial Russia]] (present-day [[Belarus]]), the son of Bessie (Farfel) and Abraham Mordecai Cohen. He moved with his family to New York, at the age of 12. He attended the [[City College of New York]] and [[Harvard University]], where he studied under [[Josiah Royce]], [[William James]], and [[Hugo Münsterberg]]. He obtained a [[PhD]] from [[Harvard]] in 1906.<ref name="MathGenealogy-1906">{{Mathgenealogy|id=51456}}</ref>

He was Professor of Philosophy at CCNY from 1912 to 1938. He also taught law at City College and the [[University of Chicago]] 1938-41, gave courses at the [[New School for Social Research]], and lectured in Philosophy and Law at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], Harvard, [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Yale University|Yale]], and other universities.

Cohen was legendary as a professor for his wit, encyclopedic knowledge, and ability to demolish philosophical systems. "He could and did tear things apart in the most devastating and entertaining way; but...he had a positive message of his own", said [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Robert Hutchins]]. [[Bertrand Russell]] said of Cohen that he had the most original mind in contemporary American philosophy.<ref>''Holmes-Laski Letters''. Edited by Mark DeWolfe Howe. Harvard University
Press, 1953 (p. 483).</ref>

In the 1930s, Cohen helped give CCNY its reputation as the "proletarian Harvard," perhaps more than any other faculty member. He advocated [[liberalism]] in politics but opposed [[laissez-faire]] economics.<ref>Cohen,''The Faith of a Liberal: Selected Essays by Morris R. Cohen''. H. Holt and Company, 1946 (p. 110).</ref> Cohen also defended [[liberal democracy]] and wrote indictments of both [[fascism]] and [[communism]].<ref name="jrm">''The Jew in the American World: a source book''.
Edited by Jacob Rader Marcus. Wayne State University Press, 1996, (pp. 317-22). {{ISBN|0-8143-2548-3}}</ref> Cohen's obituary in the ''[[New York Times]]'' called him "an almost legendary figure in American philosophy, education and the liberal tradition".<ref name="jrm" />

From his work, ''Reason and Nature'':
:To be sure, the vast majority of people who are untrained can accept the results of science only on authority. But there is obviously an important difference between an establishment that is open and invites every one to come, study its methods, and suggest improvement, and one that regards the questioning of credentials as due to wickedness of heart, such as [[Cardinal Newman]] attributed to those who questioned the infallibility of the Bible. . . . Rational science treats its credit notes as always redeemable on demand, while non-rational [[authoritarianism]] regards the demand for the redemption of its paper as a disloyal lack of faith.

On May 3, 1953, under President [[Buell G. Gallagher]], the City College Library was dedicated to and named for Morris Raphael Cohen.<ref>Rosenfield, Leonora Davidson Cohen "[http://cohenlibrary.ccny.cuny.edu/mr_cohen.html Who Was Morris Raphael Cohen?]" ''The City College Alumnus, v. 76'' #2, December 1980, p. 8-9.</ref>
