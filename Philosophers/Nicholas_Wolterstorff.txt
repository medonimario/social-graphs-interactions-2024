== Thought ==
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2024}}
While an undergraduate at Calvin College, Wolterstorff was greatly influenced by professors [[William Harry Jellema]], Henry Stob, and Henry Zylstra, who introduced him to schools of thought that have dominated his mature thinking: Reformed theology and [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|common sense]] philosophy. (These have also influenced the thinking of his friend and colleague [[Alvin Plantinga]], another alumnus of Calvin College).

Wolterstorff builds upon the ideas of the Scottish common-sense philosopher [[Thomas Reid]], who approached knowledge "from the bottom-up". Instead of reasoning about [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] conditions of knowledge, Wolterstorff suggests that knowledge and our knowing faculties are not the subject of our research but have to be seen as its starting point. He rejects classical [[foundationalism]] and instead sees knowledge as based upon insights in reality which are direct and indubitable.<ref name=":1" /> In ''Justice in Love,'' he rejects fundamentist notions of Christianity that hold to the necessity of the penal substitutionary atonement and justification by faith alone.
