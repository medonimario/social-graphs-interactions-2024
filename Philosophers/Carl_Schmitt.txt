'''Carl Schmitt'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ʃ|m|ɪ|t}}}} (11 July 1888 – 7 April 1985) was a German [[jurist]], [[political theorist]], and prominent member of the [[Nazi Party]].

Born in [[Plettenberg]] in 1888, Schmitt studied law in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], and [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]]. In 1916, he married his first wife, Pavla Dorotić, but divorced her after realizing that she had pretended to be a countess. Schmitt was Catholic but broke with the church in the 1920s. He married Duška Todorović in 1926. During this time, he taught in [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], and [[Technical University of Munich|Munich]] and published ''Dictatorship'' and ''Political Theology''. Schmitt taught in Cologne in 1932, published ''[[The Concept of the Political]]'', and supported the [[Papen cabinet|Papen government]] in ''[[1932 Prussian coup d'état#Legal proceedings: Prussia contra Reich|Prussia v. Reich]]''. After the appointment of [[Adolf Hitler]] as [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]] in 1933, Schmitt joined the [[Nazi Party]]. He was an active jurist, a member of the [[Prussian State Council]], and a professor in Berlin. In 1936 Schmitt was forced to resign his political role when the {{Lang|de|[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]|label=none}} targeted him, but [[Hermann Göring]] protected him. After the [[Second World War]] ended, Schmitt spent over a year in an internment camp and returned to Plettenberg. He refused [[denazification]], which barred him from academic positions. However, he continued his studies and frequently received scholarly visitors. In 1963, he published the ''[[Theory of the Partisan]]''. Schmitt died on 7 April 1985 at the age of 96.

Schmitt wrote extensively about the effective wielding of political power. An [[authoritarian conservative]] theorist,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Political Theory|last=Hoffman|first=John|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781317556602|pages=114}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Piero Gobetti and the Politics of Liberal Revolution|last=Martin|first=James|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-61686-8|pages=142|publisher=Springer }}</ref> he is noted as a critic of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]], [[liberalism]], and [[cosmopolitanism]].{{sfn|Vinx|2019}} His works cover political theory, legal theory, continental philosophy, and [[political theology]]. However, they are controversial, mainly due to his intellectual support for and active involvement with [[Nazism]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Caldwell |first=Peter C. |date=June 2005 |title=Controversies over Carl Schmitt: A Review of Recent Literature |journal=The Journal of Modern History |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=357–387 |doi=10.1086/431819 |issn=0022-2801}}</ref> According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "Schmitt was an acute observer and analyst of the weaknesses of liberal [[constitutionalism]] and liberal cosmopolitanism.

==Early life==
Schmitt was born in [[Plettenberg]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]], [[German Empire]]. His parents were [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] from the German [[Eifel]] region who had settled in Plettenberg. His father was a minor businessman. Schmitt studied [[law]] at the Universities of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], [[University of Munich|Munich]], and [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], and took his graduation and state examinations in then-German Strasbourg in 1915.<ref name="conscience56">{{harvnb|Koonz|2003|p=56}}</ref> His 1910 [[doctoral thesis]] was titled {{lang|de|Über Schuld und Schuldarten}} (''On Guilt and Types of Guilt'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://markkukoivusalo.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/syyllisyys.jpg|title=Cover of Carl Schmitt's dissertation from 1910|access-date=16 October 2018|archive-date=8 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308234100/https://markkukoivusalo.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/syyllisyys.jpg|url-status=live}}</ref>

Schmitt volunteered for the army in 1916.<ref name="conscience56" /> The same year, he earned his [[habilitation]] at Strasbourg with a thesis under the title {{lang|de|Der Wert des Staates und die Bedeutung des Einzelnen}} (''The Value of the State and the Significance of the Individual''). He then taught at various business schools and universities, namely the [[University of Greifswald]] (1921), the [[University of Bonn]] (1921), the [[Technical University of Munich]] (1928), the [[University of Cologne]] (1933), and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] (1933–1945).

In 1916, Schmitt married his first wife, Pavla Dorotić,<ref name="conscience57">{{harvnb|Koonz|2003|p=57}}</ref> a Croatian woman who pretended to be a countess. They divorced, but no annulment was granted by a [[Roman Curia|Catholic tribunal]], so his 1926 marriage to Duška Todorović (1903–1950), a Serbian woman, was not deemed valid under [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Catholic law]].<ref name= "conscience57" />

As a young man, Schmitt was "a devoted Catholic until his break with the church in the mid twenties".<ref>McCormick, John P. ''Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism: Against Politics as Technology''. 1st paperback ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999:86–87.</ref> From around the end of the First World War, he began to describe his Catholicism as "displaced" and "de-totalised".<ref>Müller, Jan-Werner. ''A Dangerous Mind: Carl Schmitt in Post-War European Thought''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2003:xxix.</ref>

==Academic career==
In 1921, Schmitt became a professor at the [[University of Greifswald]], where he published his essay ''Die Diktatur'' (on [[dictatorship]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In 1922 he published {{lang|de|Politische Theologie}} (''[[Political theology|Political Theology]]'') while working as a professor at the [[University of Bonn]]. Schmitt changed universities in 1926, when he became professor of law at the Handelshochschule in [[Berlin]], and again in 1932, when he accepted a position in [[University of Cologne|Cologne]]. His most famous paper, {{lang|de|italic=no|"Der Begriff des Politischen"}} ("[[The Concept of the Political]]"), was based on lectures at the {{lang|de|italic=no|[[Deutsche Hochschule für Politik]]}} in Berlin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gottfried |first=Paul |title=Carl Schmitt |year=1990 |publisher=Claridge Press |isbn=978-1-870626-46-0 |page=20}}</ref>

In 1932, Schmitt was counsel for the Reich government in the case ''Preussen contra Reich'' (''Prussia vs. Reich''), in which the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]-controlled government of the state of [[Prussia]] disputed its dismissal by the right-wing Reich government of [[Franz von Papen]]. Papen was motivated to do so because Prussia, by far the largest state in [[Germany]], served as a powerful base for the political left and provided it with institutional power, particularly in the form of the Prussian police. Schmitt, Carl Bilfinger, and Erwin Jacobi represented the Reich<ref name="gppcr">{{harvnb|Balakrishnan|2000|pages=168–169}}</ref> and one of the counsel for the Prussian government was [[Hermann Heller (legal scholar)|Hermann Heller]]. The court ruled in October 1932 that the Prussian government had been suspended unlawfully but that the Reich had the right to install a commissar.<ref name="gppcr" /> In German history, the struggle resulting in the ''de facto'' destruction of federalism in the Weimar republic is known as the ''[[Preußenschlag]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

==Hitler's seizure of control==
{{main|Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931–1933)}}

Schmitt remarked on 31 January 1933 that with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s appointment as Chancellor, "one can say that '[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] died.{{'"}}{{sfn|Balakrishnan|2000|p=187}} [[Richard Wolin]] observes:<ref name="Wolin">{{cite journal |last=Wolin |first=Richard |year=1992 |title=Carl Schmitt: The Conservative Revolutionary Habitus and the Aesthetics of Horror |journal=[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]] |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=424–25|doi=10.1177/0090591792020003003 |s2cid=143762314 }}</ref>

{{Blockquote | it is Hegel qua philosopher of the "bureaucratic class" or Beamtenstaat that has been definitely surpassed with Hitler's triumph… this class of civil servants—which Hegel in the Rechtsphilosophie deems the "universal class"—represents an impermissible drag on the sovereignty of executive authority. For Schmitt… the very essence of the bureaucratic conduct of business is reverence for the norm, a standpoint that could not but exist in great tension with the doctrines of Carl Schmitt…  Hegel had set an ignominious precedent by according this putative universal class a position of preeminence in his political thought, insofar as the primacy of the bureaucracy tends to diminish or supplant the prerogative of sovereign authority.}}

The Nazis forced the passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] in March, which changed the [[Weimar Constitution]] to allow the "present government" to rule by decree, bypassing both the President, [[Paul von Hindenburg]], and the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

[[Alfred Hugenberg]], the leader of the [[German National People's Party]], one of the Nazis' partners in the coalition government that was being squeezed out of existence, hoped to slow the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Nazi takeover of the country]] by threatening to quit his cabinet position. Hugenberg reasoned that by doing so, the government would be changed, and the Enabling Act would no longer apply, as the "present government" would no longer exist. A legal opinion by Schmitt prevented this manoeuvre from succeeding. Well known at the time as a constitutional theorist, Schmitt declared that "present government" did not refer to the cabinet's makeup when the act was passed, but to the "completely different kind of government"—that is, different from the democracy of the [[Weimar Republic]]—that the [[Hitler cabinet]] had brought into existence.<ref>[[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Richard J.]] (2003) ''[[The Coming of the Third Reich]]'' New York: [[Penguin Press]]. p. 371 {{ISBN|0-14-303469-3}}</ref>

==Nazi Party==
{{Fascism sidebar|intellectuals}}
Schmitt joined the [[Nazi Party]] on 1 May 1933.{{sfn|Koonz|2003|p=58}} Within days, he rejoiced in the burning of "un-German" and "anti-German" material by Jewish authors, and called for a much more extensive purge, to include works by authors even influenced by "Jewish" ideas.{{sfn|Koonz|2003|p=59}} From June 1933, he was in the leadership council of [[Hans Frank]]'s [[Academy for German Law]] and served as chairman of the Committee for State and Administrative Law.<ref>{{cite book |last= Klee |first= Ernst |title= Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich.

He also replaced Heller as a professor at the [[University of Berlin]],{{sfn |Balakrishnan|2000|pp=183–184}} a position he held until the end of [[World War II]]. He presented his theories as an ideological foundation of the Nazi dictatorship and a justification of the ''[[Führer]]'' state concerning legal philosophy, particularly through the concept of ''[[auctoritas]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In June 1934, Schmitt was appointed editor-in-chief of the Nazi newspaper for lawyers, the ''{{ill|Deutsche Juristen-Zeitung |de}}'' ("German Jurists' Journal").<ref name="facsimile">{{Citation | publisher = Flechsig | title = Deutsche Juristen-Zeitung | url = http://www.flechsig.biz/DJZ34_CS.pdf | language = de | access-date = 20 July 2009 | archive-date = 20 January 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100120071127/http://www.flechsig.biz/DJZ34_CS.pdf | url-status = live }}.</ref> In July he published in it "The Leader Protects the Law (''Der Führer schützt das Recht'')", a justification of the political murders of the [[Night of the Long Knives]] with Hitler's authority as the "highest form of administrative justice (''höchste Form administrativer Justiz'')".<ref name="DJR">''Deutsche Juristen-Zeitung'', 38, 1934; trans. as "The Führer Protects Justice" in Detlev Vagts, ''Carl Schmitt's Ultimate Emergency: The Night of the Long Knives'' (2012) 87(2) ''The Germanic Review'' 203.</ref> Schmitt presented himself as a radical [[antisemitism|antisemite]] and was the chairman of an October 1936 law teachers' convention in Berlin{{sfn|Koonz|2003|p=207}} at which he demanded that German law be cleansed of the "Jewish spirit (''jüdischem Geist'')" and that all Jewish scientists' publications be marked with a small symbol.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Nevertheless, in December 1936, the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) publication ''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'' accused Schmitt of being an opportunist, a Hegelian state thinker, and a Catholic, and called his antisemitism a mere pretense, citing earlier statements in which he criticized the Nazis' racial theories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/carl-schmitt%E2%80%99s-war-liberalism-12704|title=Carl Schmitt's War on Liberalism|last=Lind|first=Michael|date=2015-04-23|work=The National Interest|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en|archive-date=31 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031091208/https://nationalinterest.org/feature/carl-schmitt%E2%80%99s-war-liberalism-12704|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thechinastory.org/cot/carl-schmitt-in-china/|title=Carl Schmitt in China|website=The China story|place=[[Australia|AU]]|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-10-31|archive-date=5 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005230701/https://www.thechinastory.org/cot/carl-schmitt-in-china/|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Schmitt|2008a|p=xx}} After this, Schmitt resigned as ''Reichsfachgruppenleiter'' (Reich Professional Group Leader) but retained his professorship in Berlin and his title "Prussian State Councillor".

During the [[Paris in World War II|German occupation of Paris]] a "round-table" of French and German intellectuals met at the [[Georges V Hotel in Paris|Georges V Hotel]], including Schmitt, the writers [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Paul Morand]], [[Jean Cocteau]], and [[Henry de Montherlant]], and the publisher [[Gaston Gallimard]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Jünger |first= Ernst|authorlink=Ernst Jünger|title=A German Officer in Occupied Paris|year=2019|publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York|isbn=978-0-23112740-0|page=xvi}}</ref>

==After World War II==
[[File:Wohnhaus 1971-1985.jpeg|thumb|275px|"San Casciano", home of Carl Schmitt in Plettenberg-Pasel from 1971 until 1985]]
In 1945, American forces captured Schmitt and, after spending more than a year in an internment camp, he returned to his home town of [[Plettenberg]] and later to the house of his housekeeper Anni Stand in Plettenberg-Pasel. He remained unrepentant for his role in the creation of the Nazi state, and refused every attempt at [[denazification]], which barred him from academic jobs.{{sfn|Vinx|2019}} Despite being isolated from the mainstream of the scholarly and political community, he continued his studies, especially of [[international law]], from the 1950s on, and frequently received visitors, both colleagues and younger intellectuals, well into his old age. Among the visitors were [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Jacob Taubes]], and [[Alexandre Kojève]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In 1962, Schmitt gave lectures in [[Francoist Spain]], two of which resulted in the publication, the next year, of ''[[Theory of the Partisan]];'' here he characterized the [[Spanish Civil War]] as a "war of national liberation" against "international Communism". Schmitt regarded the [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] as a specific and significant phenomenon which, during the latter half of the 20th century, indicated the emergence of a new theory of warfare.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Schmitt and Todorović had a daughter, Anima, who in 1957 married Alfonso Otero Varela (1925–2001), a Spanish law professor at the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] and a member of the ruling [[FET y de las JONS]] party in [[Francoist Spain]]. She translated several of her father's works into Spanish. Letters from Schmitt to his son-in-law have been published. Schmitt died on 7 April 1985 and is buried in [[Plettenberg]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021 |title=Carl Schmitt-Erinnerungsorte in Plettenberg |url=https://www.carl-schmitt.de/wp-content/uploads/Erinnerungsorte_neu-3.pdf |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=1 October 2024 |website=carl-schmitt.de}}</ref>

==Publications==
===''The Dictatorship''===
In his essay ''Die Diktatur'' ("The Dictatorship"), he discussed the foundations of the newly established [[Weimar Republic]], emphasising the office of the [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|President of Germany]]. In this essay, Schmitt compared and contrasted what he saw as the effective and ineffective elements of the new constitution of his country. He saw the office of the president as a comparatively effective element, because of the power granted to the president to declare a [[state of exception]] (''Ausnahmezustand''). This power, which Schmitt discussed and implicitly praised as dictatorial,<ref name="DJR" /> was more in line with the underlying mentality of executive power than the comparatively slow and ineffective processes of legislative power reached through parliamentary discussion and compromise.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Schmitt was at pains to remove what he saw as a taboo surrounding the concept of "dictatorship" and to show that the concept is implicit whenever power is wielded by means other than the slow processes of parliamentary politics and the bureaucracy:<ref>[http://www.hjlenger.de/reader/schmitt%20theologie%20diktatur%20leviathan.pdf ''Die Diktatur''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124022722/http://www.hjlenger.de/reader/schmitt%20theologie%20diktatur%20leviathan.pdf |date=2013-01-24 }} § XV p. 11.</ref>

{{blockquote|If the constitution of a state is democratic, then every exceptional negation of democratic principles, every exercise of state power independent of the approval of the majority, can be called dictatorship.}}

For Schmitt, every government capable of decisive action must include a dictatorial element within its constitution. Although the German concept of ''Ausnahmezustand'' is best translated as "state of emergency", it literally means "[[state of exception]]" which, according to Schmitt, frees the executive from any legal restraints to its power that would normally apply. The use of the term "exceptional" has to be underlined here: Schmitt defines [[sovereignty]] as the power to ''decide'' to initiate a [[state of emergency|state of exception]], as [[Giorgio Agamben]] has noted. According to Agamben,{{sfn|Agamben|2005|pp=52–55}} Schmitt's conceptualization of the "state of exception" as belonging to the core-concept of sovereignty was a response to [[Walter Benjamin]]'s concept of a "pure" or "revolutionary" violence, which did not enter into any relationship whatsoever with right. Through the state of exception, Schmitt included all types of violence under right, in the case of the authority of Hitler leading to the formulation "The leader defends the law" ("''Der Führer schützt das Recht''").<ref name="DJR" />

Schmitt opposed what he termed "commissarial dictatorship", or the declaration of a state of emergency in order to save the legal order (a temporary suspension of law, defined itself by moral or legal right): the state of emergency is limited (even if ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'', by law) to "sovereign dictatorship", in which law was suspended, as in the classical state of exception, not to "save the [[Constitution]]", but rather to create another constitution. This is how he theorized [[Adolf Hitler]]'s continual suspension of the legal constitutional order during the [[Third Reich]] (the [[Weimar Republic]]'s Constitution was never abrogated, emphasized Giorgio Agamben;<ref>{{harvnb|Agamben|1998|p=168}}. On the February 28, 1933, decree of the ''Ausnahmezustand'' (state of exception), Agamben notes that this very term was conspicuously absent: "The decree remained de facto in force until the end of the Third Reich... The state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself."</ref> rather, it was "suspended" for four years, first with the 28 February 1933 [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], with the suspension renewed every four years, implying a continual state of emergency).{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

===''Political Theology'' <!-- Redirected from [[Politische Theologie]] -->===
''On Dictatorship'' was followed by another essay in 1922, titled ''Politische Theologie'' ([[political theology]]); in it, Schmitt, gave further substance to his authoritarian theories with the now notorious definition: "Sovereign is he who decides on the exception." By "exception", Schmitt means stepping outside the [[rule of law]] under the [[state of exception]] (''Ausnahmezustand'') doctrine he first introduced in ''On Dictatorship'' for the purpose of managing some crisis, which Schmitt defines loosely as "a case of extreme peril, a danger to the existence of the state, or the like." For this reason, the "exception" is understood as a "borderline concept" for Schmitt because it is not within the purview of the normal legal order. Schmitt opposes this definition of sovereignty to those offered by contemporary theorists on the issue, particularly [[Hans Kelsen]], whose work is criticized at several points in the essay. The state of exception is a critique of "normativism", a [[legal positivism|positivist]] concept of law developed by Kelsen of law as the expression of norms that are abstract and generally applicable, in all circumstances.<ref>{{cite book |last=Head |first=Michael |title=Emergency Powers in Theory and Practice: The Long Shadow Carl Schmitt |publisher=Ashgate |page=16}}</ref>

A year later, Schmitt supported the emergence of [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] power structures in his paper "''Die geistesgeschichtliche Lage des heutigen Parlamentarismus''" (roughly: "The Intellectual-Historical Situation of Today's Parliamentarianism", translated as ''[[The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy]]'' by Ellen Kennedy). Schmitt criticized the institutional practices of liberal politics, arguing that they are justified by a faith in rational discussion and openness that is at odds with actual parliamentary [[party politics]], in which outcomes are hammered out in [[smoke-filled room]]s by party leaders. Schmitt also posits an essential division between the liberal doctrine of [[separation of powers]] and what he holds to be the nature of [[democracy]] itself, the identity of the rulers and the ruled. Although many critics of Schmitt today, such as [[Stephen Holmes (political scientist)|Stephen Holmes]] in his ''The Anatomy of Anti-Liberalism'', take exception to his fundamentally [[authoritarian]] outlook, the idea of incompatibility between liberalism and democracy is one reason for the continued interest in his [[political philosophy]].<ref>William E. Scheuerman, "Survey Article: Emergency Powers and the Rule of Law after 9/11", ''[[The Journal of Political Philosophy]]'', vol. 14, no. 1, 2006, pp. 61–84.</ref>

In chapter 4 of his ''State of Exception'' (2005), Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] argued that Schmitt's ''Political Theology'' ought to be read as a response to [[Walter Benjamin]]'s influential essay ''Towards the Critique of Violence''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

The book's title derives from Schmitt's assertion (in chapter 3) that "all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts"—in other words, that [[political theory]] addresses the state (and sovereignty) in much the same manner as [[theology]] does God.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

===''The Concept of the Political''===
{{Main|The Concept of the Political}}

For Schmitt, "the political" is not equal to any other domain, such as the economic (which distinguishes between profitable and not profitable), but instead is the most essential to identity. While churches are predominant in religion or society is predominant in economics, the state is usually predominant in politics. Yet, for Schmitt, the political was not autonomous or equivalent to the other domains, but rather the existential basis that would determine any other domain should it reach the point of politics (e.g. religion ceases to be merely theological when it makes a clear distinction between the "friend" and the "enemy").{{citation needed|date=November 2023}}

He views political concepts and images as inherently contestable. Hegemonic powers seek to control and direct how political concepts are applied for a purpose and to effect an outcome such as making the enemy knowable and, in all cases, intended to manifest the inclusive and exclusive aspects of the social order represented by the political words and symbolism:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thaler |first1=Mathias |title=Naming Violence: A Critical Theory of Genocide, Torture, and Terrorism |date=2018 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |page=4}}</ref>

{{quote|All political concepts, images, and terms have a polemical meaning. They are focused on a specific conflict and are bound to a concrete situation; the result (which manifests itself in war or revolution) is a friend–enemy grouping, and they turn into empty and ghostlike abstractions when this situation disappears. Words such as state, republic, society, class, as well as sovereignty, constitutional state, absolutism, dictatorship, economic planning, neutral or total state, and so on, are incomprehensible if one does not know exactly who is to be affected, combated, refuted or negated by such a term.}}

Schmitt, in perhaps his best-known formulation, bases his conceptual realm of state sovereignty and autonomy upon the distinction between ''friend'' and ''enemy''. Schmitt writes:{{sfn|Schmitt|2008a|p=27}}

{{quote|The political enemy need not be morally evil or aesthetically ugly… But he is, nevertheless, the other, the stranger&nbsp;...}}

This distinction is to be determined "existentially", which is to say that the enemy is whoever is "in a specially intense way, existentially something different and alien, so that in the extreme case conflicts with him are possible".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schmitt |first=Carl |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sUYDQIXSEtoC |title=The Concept of the Political |edition=expanded |date=2008-12-01 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-73884-0 |pages=27 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0">For a good discussion of Schmitt's ideas on this topic, see {{cite journal |first=Charles E. |last=Frye |title=Carl Schmitt's Concept of the Political |journal=[[The Journal of Politics]] |volume=28 |issue=4 |date=November 1966 |pages=818–830 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.2307/2127676 |jstor=2127676}}</ref> Such an enemy need not even be based on nationality: so long as the conflict is potentially intense enough to become a violent one between political entities, the actual substance of enmity may be anything.<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Benabdallah |first=Amine |date=2007 |title=Une réception de Carl Schmitt dans l'extrême-gauche: La théologie politique de Giorgio Agamben |type=Master's thesis |url=https://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.1.2065.4965/1 |publisher=Sciences Po, Paris |language=fr |doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.2065.4965/1}}</ref> In this work, Schmitt makes the distinction between several different types of enemies one may make, stating that political enemies ought to be made out of a legitimate concern for the safety of the state rather than moral intuitions.{{sfn|Schmitt|2008a|p=28}}

The collectivization of friendship and enmity is, for Schmitt, the essence of politics. This theory of politics was influential in the Third Reich where the recognition and eradication of the enemy became a necessary component of the collective national identity. Similar views were shared by other Nazi legal theorists like [[Werner Best]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Bartov |first=Omer |title=Mirrors of Destruction: War, Genocide and Modern Identity |date=2000 |page=143}}</ref> Although there have been divergent interpretations concerning this work, there is broad agreement that ''The Concept of the Political'' is an attempt to achieve state unity by defining the content of politics as opposition to the "enemy". Additionally, the prominence of the state stands as an arbitrary force dominating potentially fractious civil society, whose various antagonisms must not be allowed to affect politics, lest civil war result.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

===''Political Romanticism''===
Schmitt's ''Political Romanticism'' (1926) contains Schmitt's critique of [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] [[German conservatism|conservatism]], which he considers unrealistic for the political arena of the modern era as it only seeks a restoration of the ''[[ancien régime]]'', which Schmitt considers unfeasible. Distancing himself from the tradition of legitimist "restorative conservatives" such as [[Adam Müller]] or [[Joseph de Maistre]], Schmitt instead champions the thought of the 19th century Spanish reactionary thinker [[Juan Donoso Cortés]], who advocated for a dictatorship.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Destruction of Reason|last=Lukács|first=György|publisher=Merlin Press|year=1980|orig-year=1952|publication-place=London|chapter=German Sociology of the Imperialist Period|chapter-url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4179816/mod_resource/content/1/THE%20DESTRUCTION%20OF%20REASON.pdf|translator-last=Palmer|translator-first=Peter R.|access-date=3 December 2023|archive-date=6 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406203959/https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4179816/mod_resource/content/1/THE%20DESTRUCTION%20OF%20REASON.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to [[György Lukács]], this text is both the starting point of Schmitt's advocacy for a [[Realpolitik|politics of realism]] and his extreme anti-humanism. Lukács quotes Schmitt's comment that Cortes's 'great theoretical significance for the history of counter-revolutionary theory lies in [that] his contempt for human beings knew no bounds; their blind understanding, their feeble wills, the derisory elan of their carnal desires seem so pitiful to him that all the vocabulary of all human languages is not sufficient to express the full baseness of these creatures,' and Lukács writes:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Destruction of Reason|last=Lukács|first=György|publisher=Merlin Press|year=1980|orig-year=1952|publication-place=London|chapter=Epilogue|chapter-url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4179816/mod_resource/content/1/THE%20DESTRUCTION%20OF%20REASON.pdf|translator-last=Palmer|translator-first=Peter R.|access-date=3 December 2023|archive-date=6 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406203959/https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4179816/mod_resource/content/1/THE%20DESTRUCTION%20OF%20REASON.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

<blockquote>Here we clearly perceive Schmitt's association with all anti-human tendencies, past and present, along with the reason for it in socio-human terms: he is an enemy of the masses grown blind with hatred, a fanatic in the campaign against ''Vermassung'' or mass feeling.</blockquote>

====Dialogue with Leo Strauss====
Schmitt provided a positive reference for [[Leo Strauss]], and approved his work, which was instrumental in winning Strauss the scholarship funding that allowed him to leave Germany.<ref>''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: the hidden dialogue'', [[Heinrich Meier]], University of Chicago Press 1995, 123</ref> In turn, Strauss's critique and clarifications of ''The Concept of the Political'' led Schmitt to make significant emendations in its second edition. Writing to Schmitt during 1932, Strauss summarized Schmitt's political theology thus: "[B]ecause man is by nature evil, he therefore needs ''dominion''. But dominion can be established, that is, men can be unified only in a unity against—against other men. Every association of men is necessarily a separation from other men… the political thus understood is not the constitutive principle of the state, of order, but a condition of the state."<ref>''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: the hidden dialogue'', Heinrich Meier, University of Chicago Press 1995, 125</ref>

=== ''The Leviathan in the State Theory of Thomas Hobbes'' ===
''The Leviathan in the State Theory of Thomas Hobbes'', with the subtitle "Meaning and Failure of a Political Symbol", is a 1938 work by Schmitt that revisits one of his most critical theoretical inspirations: [[Thomas Hobbes]]. Schmitt's work can be described as both a critique and appraisal of the controversial political theorist. This work also contains some of Schmitt's more anti-Semitic language. As contemporary writers on Schmitt have noted, his anti-Semitism may be read as more a kind of "anti-Judaism" as, unlike his Nazi allies, he did not attribute the dangers of Judaism to "biological" reasons but strictly religious ones. This work by Schmitt is also one of the most intimately involved by him with the concept of myth in a political setting.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

The text itself begins with an overview of the religious history of the mythical character "[[Leviathan]]". Schmitt traces this character as a unique subject of conflicting interpretations in [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] doctrines, whereby the Leviathan, understood most pointedly as a "big fish," is occasionally interchangeable with that of a dragon or serpent, which Schmitt remarks have been "protective and benevolent deities"{{sfn|Schmitt|2008b|p=9}} in the history of non-Jewish peoples. But, as Schmitt makes clear, Hobbes' Leviathan is very different from these interpretations, being illustrated firstly in his work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' as a "huge man". The Leviathan as a "huge man" is used throughout Hobbes' work as a symbol of the sovereign person. Although the Leviathan is not the only allegory made by Hobbes of the sovereign, which gravitates throughout his work as "a huge man, a huge leviathan, an artificial being, an ''animal artificiale'', an ''automaton'', or a ''machina''".{{sfn|Schmitt|2008b|p=19}} Hobbes' concern was mainly to convey the sovereign person as a frightening creature that could instill fear into those chaotic elements of man that belong to his interpretation of the [[state of nature]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Schmitt's critique of Hobbes begins with Hobbes' understanding of the state as a "machine" which is set into motion by the sovereign. This, according to Schmitt, is actually a continuation of [[René Descartes]]'s concept of [[mind–body dualism]]. For Hobbes to conceptualize the state as a machine whose soul is the sovereign renders it really as just a mechanic structure, carrying over the cartesian dualism into political theory: "As a totality, the state is body and soul, a ''homo artificialis'', and, as such, a machine. It is a manmade product... the soul thereby becomes a mere component of a machine artificially manufactured by man."{{sfn|Schmitt|2008b|p=34}} Schmitt adds that this technical conception of the state is essential in the modern interpretation of government as a widespread administrative organ.{{efn|1=The concept of the "administrative state" is elaborated by Schmitt in his other works such as ''Legality and Legitimacy'' as a technical interpretation of state activity that is excessively bureaucratic and wherein all disputes of the state can be settled through "more proper" or "more perfect" management.{{sfn|Schmitt|2008b|pp=5–6}}}} Therefore, Schmitt attributes Hobbes' mechanistic and often also a legally positivist interpretation of the state (what is legitimate = what is legal) with the process of political neutralization. This is consistent with Schmitt's larger attitude toward attempts to apply technical principles to political matters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Also, Schmitt critiques Hobbes' insistence that belief in miracles must only be outwardly consistent with the position of the state and can, privately, deviate into one's own opinion as to the validity of such "miracles".{{sfn|Schmitt|2008b|p=56}} The belief in miracles was a relevant point in Hobbes' century for kings would regularly "bestow miracles" by touching the hands of those of ill health, supposedly healing them—obviously a consequence of the medieval belief that kings had a divine character. Hobbes' position was that "private reason" may disagree with what the state claims to be a miracle, but the "public reason" must by necessity agree to its position in order to avoid chaos. Schmitt's critique of Hobbes here is twofold. Firstly, Hobbes opens the crack toward a liberal understanding of [[Individual and group rights|individual rights]] (such as the right to "private reason") which Schmitt was a tireless critique of and, secondly, Hobbes guts the state of any "substantive truth" (such as the genuine belief of the individual, even in private, of the kings [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]) and renders the state into now simply a "justifiable external power".{{sfn|Schmitt|2008b|p=56}} This opens up the elementary basis of liberal society which, for Schmitt, was [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]]. Such a pluralist society lacked ideological homogeneity and nationally bound group identity, both of which were fundamental premises of a democratic society to Schmitt.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|title=The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy|publisher=The MIT Press}}</ref> Despite his critiques, Schmitt, nonetheless, finishes the book with a celebration of Hobbes as a truly magnificent thinker, ranking him along with other theorists he values greatly like [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Giambattista Vico]].{{sfn|Schmitt|2008b|pp=83–86}}

===''The Nomos of the Earth''===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}

''The Nomos of the Earth'' is Schmitt's most historical and geopolitical work. Published in 1950, it was also one of his final texts. It describes the origin of the [[Eurocentric]] global order, which Schmitt dates from the [[discovery of the New World]], discusses its specific character and its contribution to civilization, analyses the reasons for its decline at the end of the 19th century, and concludes with prospects for a new world order. It defends European achievements, not only in creating the first truly global order of [[international law]], but also in limiting war to conflicts among sovereign states, which, in effect, civilized war. In Schmitt's view, the European sovereign state was the greatest achievement of [[Europe|Occidental]] rationalism; in becoming the principal agency of secularization, the European state created the modern age.

Notable in Schmitt's discussion of the European epoch of world history is the role played by the [[New World]], which ultimately replaced the [[Old World]] as the centre of the Earth and became the arbiter in European and world politics. According to Schmitt, the [[United States]]' internal conflicts between economic presence and political absence, between isolationism and interventionism, are global problems, which today continue to hamper the creation of a new world order. But however critical Schmitt is of American actions at the end of the 19th century and after World War I, he considered the United States to be the only political entity capable of resolving the crisis of global order.

===''Hamlet or Hecuba''===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}

Published in 1956, ''Hamlet or Hecuba: The Intrusion of the Time into the Play'' was Schmitt's most extended piece of literary criticism. In it Schmitt focuses his attention on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' and argues that the significance of the work hinges on its ability to integrate history in the form of the taboo of the queen and the deformation of the figure of the avenger. Schmitt uses this interpretation to develop a theory of myth and politics that serves as a cultural foundation for his concept of political representation. Beyond literary criticism or historical analysis, Schmitt's book also reveals a comprehensive theory of the relationship between aesthetics and politics that responds to alternative ideas developed by [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]].

===''Theory of the Partisan''===
{{Main|Theory of the Partisan}}

Schmitt's ''Theory of the Partisan'' originated in two lectures delivered during 1962,{{sfn|Schmitt|2004|page=11}} and has been seen as a rethinking of ''The Concept of the Political''.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Michael|last1=Hoelzl |first2=Graham|last2=Ward |title=Editors' introduction to Political Theology II |publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity]] |year=2008|page=4|isbn=978-0-7456-4254-3}}</ref> It addressed the transformation of war in the post-European age, analysing a specific and significant phenomenon that ushered in a new [[theory of war]] and enmity. It contains an implicit theory of the terrorist, which during the 21st century has resulted in yet another new theory of war and enmity. In the lectures, Schmitt directly tackles the issues surrounding "the problem of the Partisan" figure: the guerrilla or revolutionary who "fights irregularly" (p.&nbsp;3).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.telospress.com/?main_page=product_info&products_id=318 | title=Telos Press | access-date=19 March 2022 | archive-date=12 February 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220212032617/http://www.telospress.com/?main_page=product_info&products_id=318 | url-status=live }}{{Failed verification|date=March 2022|reason=Nothing there.}}</ref> Both because of its scope, with extended discussions on historical figures like [[Napoleon]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Mao Zedong]], as well as the events marking the beginning of the 20th century, Schmitt's text has had a resurgence of popularity. [[Jacques Derrida]], in his ''Politics of Friendship'' remarked:<ref>{{cite book|first=Jacques|last=Derrida|author-link=Jacques Derrida|title=The Politics of Friendship|publisher=Verso|year=1997|page=146|isbn=978-1-84467-054-3}}</ref>

<blockquote>
Despite certain signs of ironic distrust in the areas of metaphysics and ontology, ''The Concept of the Political'' was, as we have seen, a philosophical type of essay to 'frame' the topic of a concept unable to constitute itself on philosophical ground. But in ''Theory of the Partisan'', it is in the same areas that the topic of this concept is both radicalized and properly uprooted, where Schmitt wished to regrasp in history the event or node of events that engaged this uprooting radicalization, and it is precisely there that the philosophical as such intervenes again.
</blockquote>

Schmitt concludes ''Theory of the Partisan'' with the statement: "The theory of the partisan flows into the question of the concept of the political, into the question of the real enemy and of a new ''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'' of the earth."{{sfn|Schmitt|2004|page=78}} Schmitt's work on the Partisan has since spurred comparisons with the post-9/11 'terrorist' in recent scholarship.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1080/14797585.2017.1410991|title = Carl Schmitt's politics in the age of drone strikes: Examining the Schmittian texture of Obama's enemy|year = 2018|last1 = Fairhead|first1 = Edward|journal = Journal for Cultural Research|volume = 22|pages = 39–54|s2cid = 148618541}}</ref> The Italian philosopher [[Domenico Losurdo]] comments:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Il linguaggio dell'Impero.

<blockquote>Thus, for Schmitt, the colonized peoples' struggle for national independence, although embracing ever larger sections of the population, becomes synonymous with terrorism, while the actions of the occupying army, foreign and hated by the citizens of the occupied country, are characterized as "counter-terrorist". Of course, the "retaliations" can be very harsh, but - Schmitt observes, referring to [[Algerian War|Algeria]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] - we must take into account the "irresistible logic of the old rule according to which insurgents can only be dealt with by insurgent methods." As we see, the main difference between terrorism and counter-terrorism is not a specific behavior (ie. the impact on, or participation of, citizens). It coincides with the border between barbarism and civilization, between East and West. The power that determines who the barbarians are every time also determines who the terrorists are.</blockquote>

==Influence==
{{Conservatism in Germany|Intellectuals}}
Through [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Andrew Arato]], [[Chantal Mouffe]] and other writers, Schmitt has become a common reference in recent writings of the intellectual left as well as the right.<ref>See for example Lebovic, Nitzan (2008), "The Jerusalem School: The Theo-Political Hour", ''New German Critique'' (103), 97–120.</ref> These discussions concern not only the interpretation of Schmitt's own positions, but also matters relevant to contemporary politics: the idea that laws of the state cannot strictly limit actions of its [[sovereignty|sovereign]], the problem of a "[[state of exception]]" (later expanded upon by Agamben).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ine réception de Carl Schmitt dans l'extrême-gauche: La théologie politique de Giorgio Agamben|language=fr|author=Amine Benabdallah|date=June 2007|access-date=2015-04-14 |url=http://fr.slideshare.net/AmineBenabdallah1/la-rception-de-carl-schmitt-par-giorgio-agamben-a-benabdallah|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134127/http://fr.slideshare.net/AmineBenabdallah1/la-rception-de-carl-schmitt-par-giorgio-agamben-a-benabdallah |archive-date=2015-04-02 }}</ref>

Schmitt's argument that political concepts are ''secularized theological concepts'' has also recently been seen as consequential for those interested in contemporary [[political theology]]. The German-Jewish philosopher [[Jacob Taubes]], for example, engaged Schmitt widely in his study of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], ''The Political Theology of Paul'' (Stanford Univ. Press, 2004). Taubes' understanding of political theology is, however, very different from Schmitt's, and emphasizes the political aspect of theological claims, rather than the religious derivation of political claims.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Schmitt is described as a "classic of political thought" by [[Herfried Münkler]], while in the same article Münkler speaks of his post-war writings as reflecting an "embittered, jealous, occasionally malicious man" ("verbitterten, eifersüchtigen, gelegentlich bösartigen Mann"). Schmitt was termed the "Crown Jurist of the [[Third Reich]]" ("Kronjurist des Dritten Reiches") by [[Waldemar Gurian]].<ref>[[Herfried Münkler]], Erkenntnis wächst an den Rändern – Der Denker Carl Schmitt beschäftigt auch 20 Jahre nach seinem Tod Rechte wie Linke, in [https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article583822/Erkenntnis_waechst_an_den_Raendern.html ''Die Welt''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118084207/https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article583822/Erkenntnis_waechst_an_den_Raendern.html |date=18 January 2012 }}, 7 April 2005</ref>

According to historian Renato Cristi in the writing of the 1980 [[Chilean Constitution of 1980|Constitution of Chile]], [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] collaborator [[Jaime Guzmán]] based his work on the ''pouvoir constituant'' concept used by Schmitt (as well as drawing inspiration in the ideas of [[Market economy|market society]] of [[Friedrich Hayek]]). This way Guzmán would have enabled a framework for a dictatorial state combined with a [[free market]] economic system.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=[[LOM Ediciones]] |title=El pensamiento político de Jaime Guzmán |edition=2nd |url=http://www.lom.cl/330a726e-6617-494e-bae3-7b95b5bb19ae/El-pensamiento-pol%C3%ADtico-de-Jaime-Guzm%C3%A1n-%282%C2%AA-edici%C3%B3n%29.aspx |access-date=10 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145722/http://www.lom.cl/330a726e-6617-494e-bae3-7b95b5bb19ae/El-pensamiento-pol%C3%ADtico-de-Jaime-Guzm%C3%A1n-%282%C2%AA-edici%C3%B3n%29.aspx |archive-date=14 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Law of emergency powers===

Schmitt's "state of exception" doctrine has enjoyed a revival in the 21st century. Formulated 10 years before the 1933 Nazi takeover of Germany, Schmitt claimed that urgency justified the following:<ref name="Head 14">{{cite book |last=Head |first=Michael |title=Emergency Powers in Theory and Practice: The Long Shadow Carl Schmitt |publisher=Ashgate |page=14}}</ref>

The first important wave of Schmitt's reception in China started with Liu's writings at the end of the 1990s.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Xiaofeng|date=1998|title=Carl Schmitt and the Predicament of Liberal Constitutionalism|journal=[[Twenty-First Century]]|volume=47}}</ref> In the context of a transition period, Schmitt was used both by liberal, nationalist and conservative intellectuals to find answers to contemporary issues. In the 21st century, most of them are still concerned with state power and to what extent a strong state is required to tackle China's modernization. Some authors consider Schmitt's works as a weapon against liberalism.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Jian|date=2006|title=For the Sake of Fighting the Common Enemy: Schmitt and his Allies|journal=[[Twenty-First Century]]|volume=94}}</ref> Others think that his theories are helpful for China's development.<ref name="Sapio" />

A critical reception of his use in a Chinese context does also exist.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Ben|date=2006|title=China Has No Need of Such 'Politics' and 'Decisionism': The Cult of Carl Schmitt and Nationalism|journal=[[Twenty-First Century]]|volume=94}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Gao|first=Quanxi|date=2006|title=The Issues of Carl Schmitt in the Context of the Chinese Society|journal=[[Twenty-First Century]]|volume=95}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> These differences go together with different interpretations of Schmitt's relation with fascism. While some scholars regard him as a faithful follower of fascism, others, such as Liu Xiaofeng, consider his support to the Nazi regime only as instrumental and attempt to separate his works from their historical context.<ref name=":1" /> According to them, his real goal is to pave a different and unique way for the modernization of Germany—precisely what makes him interesting for China. Generally speaking, the Chinese reception is ambivalent: quite diverse and dynamic, but also highly ideological.<ref name="Sapio" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Qi|first=Zheng|date=2012|title=Carl Schmitt in China|journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]|volume=2012|issue=160|pages=29–52|doi=10.3817/0912160029|s2cid=219190612}}</ref> Other scholars are cautious when it comes to Schmitt's arguments for state power, considering the danger of totalitarianism, they assume at the same time that state power is necessary for the current transition and that a "dogmatic faith" in liberalism is unsuitable for China.<ref name=":3" /> By emphasizing the danger of social chaos, many of them agree with Schmitt—beyond their differences—on the necessity of a strong state.<ref name="Sapio" />
