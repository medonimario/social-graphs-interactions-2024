==Biography==

===Early life===
Saadia was born in Dilāẓ in the [[Faiyum]] in [[Middle Egypt]] in 892. He immigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (in the Abbasid province of Bilad Al-Sham) in 915 at the age of 23, where he studied in [[Tiberias]] under the scholar Abu Kathir Yaḥya al-Katib (known as [[Eli ben Yehudah ha-Nazir]] in Hebrew), a Jewish [[mutakallim]] or theologian also mentioned by [[ibn Hazm|ibn Ḥazm]]. In 926, Saadia settled permanently in [[Lower Mesopotamia]], known to Jews as "[[Talmudic academies in Babylonia|Babylonia]]", where he became a member of [[Sura Academy]].

Saadia, in ''Sefer ha-Galui'', stresses his Jewish lineage, claiming to belong to the noble family of [[Shelah (son of Judah)|Shelah]], son of [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]],<ref>{{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|1|4:21|HE}}</ref> and counting among his ancestors [[Hanina ben Dosa]], the famous ascetic of the first century. Saadia expressed this claim by calling his son [[Dosa ben Saadia|Dosa]]; this son later served as gaon of Sura Academy from 1012–1018. Regarding Joseph, Saadia's father, a statement of the [[Talmudic academies in Syria Palaestina|Palestinian gaon]] [[Aaron ben Meïr]] has been preserved saying that he was compelled to leave Egypt and died in [[Jaffa]], probably during Saadia's prolonged residence in the [[Holy Land]].

The usual [[Nisba (onomastics)|nisba]] ''al-Fayyumi'' refers to Saadia's native place, the [[Fayyum]], which is located in [[Middle Egypt]]; in Hebrew, it is often given as ''Pitomi'', derived from a contemporary identification of Fayum with the Biblical [[Pithom]], an identification found in Saadia's works.

At the age of 20, Saadia began composing his first great work, the Hebrew [[dictionary]] called the ''[[Agron (dictionary)|Agron]]''.<ref>[[Abraham Firkovich]], Hebrew Newspaper ''Hamelitz'' - 1868, Issue 26–27</ref>  At 23, he composed a polemic against the followers of [[Anan ben David]], particularly Solomon ben Yeruham, thus beginning the activity which was to prove important in opposition to [[Karaite Judaism]] in defense of [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. In the same year, he left Egypt and moved to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

In 921, Saadia triumphed over Gaon Aaron ben Meïr over the latter's introduction of a new [[triennial cycle]] of Torah reading that also changed the dates of [[Passover]] and [[Rosh Hashanah]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Saadia Gaon |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/saadia-gaon |website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref> Later, one of Saadia's chief disputants was the Karaite by the name of Abu al-Surri ben Zuṭa, who is referred to by [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], in his commentary on [[Mishpatim#Second reading—Exodus 21:20–22:3|Exodus 21:24]] and [[Emor#Fifth reading—Leviticus 23:23–32|Leviticus 23:15]]).<ref>[Herzog College Ben Zuta], [[Herzog College]] (in Hebrew)</ref>

In the year 928, at the age of thirty-six (variant: forty-six), [[David ben Zakkai]], the [[Exilarch]] or head of Babylonian Jewry, petitioned Saadia to assume the honorary title of gaon, where he was appointed that same year the Gaon of Sura Academy at [[Mata Mehasya]], a position which he held for 14 years until his death.<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Sherira Gaon |author-link=Sherira Gaon |title=The Iggeres of Rav Sherira Gaon |translator=Nosson Dovid Rabinowich | publisher=Rabbi Jacob Joseph School Press - Ahavath Torah Institute Moznaim|date=1988 |location=Jerusalem|pages=150–151 |language=en|oclc=923562173 }}</ref>

After only two years of teaching, Saadia recused himself from teaching because of a dispute that had fallen out between him and the Exilarch. During Saadia's absence, his post was occupied by [[Joseph ben Jacob]], the grandson of [[Natronai ben Hilai]]. At length, Saadia was reconciled with the Exilarch and returned to serve in his former position, although Joseph ben Jacob also remained serving in his capacity as Gaon.

===Dispute with Ben Meir===
In 922, six years before Saadia was appointed Gaon of Babylonia, a controversy arose concerning the [[Hebrew calendar]], that threatened the entire Jewish community. Since [[Hillel II]] (around 359 CE), the calendar had been based on a series of rules (described more fully in [[Maimonides]]' Code<ref>Laws of the Sanctification of the Moon, chs. 6-10, written c. 1170.</ref>) rather than on observation of the [[lunar phase]]s. One of these rules required the date of [[Rosh Hashanah]] to be postponed if the calculated [[lunar conjunction]] occurred at noon or later. Rabbi [[Aaron ben Meïr]], head of the [[Palestinian Gaonate]] (then located in [[Ramla]]), claimed a tradition according to which the cutoff point was 642/1080 of an hour (approximately 35 minutes) after noon.{{cfn|Various suggestions have been made as to where Ben Meir got this figure. A contemporary author, Remy Landau, suggests that he wanted to optimize the rule and thereby reduce the frequency of this postponement: {{cite web |title=Hebrew Calendar Science and Myths |url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/1584/index.html |date=7 March 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000307015735/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/1584/index.html |archive-date=2000-03-07 }}|date=July 2024}} In that particular year, this change would result in a two-day schism with the major Jewish communities in Babylonia: according to Ben Meir the first day of Passover would be on a Sunday, while according to the generally accepted rule it would be on Tuesday.

Saadia was in [[Aleppo]], on his way from the East, when he learned of Ben Meïr's regulation of the Jewish calendar. Saadia addressed a warning to him, and in Mesopotamia, he placed his knowledge and pen at the disposal of the exilarch [[David ben Zakkai]] and the scholars of the academies, adding his letters to those sent by them to the communities of the [[Jewish diaspora]] (922). In Babylonia, he wrote his ''Sefer haMo'adim'', or "Book of [[Jewish festivals|Festivals]]," in which he refuted the assertions of Ben Meïr regarding the calendar and helped to avert from the Jewish community the perils of schism.

===Appointment as Gaon===
His dispute with Ben Meir was an important factor in his call to Sura in 928. The Exilarch insisted on appointing him as Gaon "head of the academy" despite the weight of precedent (no foreigner had ever served as Gaon before) and against the advice of the aged Nissim Nahrwani, a [[Resh Kallah]] at Sura, who feared a confrontation between the two strong-willed personalities, Exilarch David and Saadia. Nissim declared, however, that if David was determined to see Saadia in the position, then he would be ready to become the first of Saadia's followers.<ref>Yuchasin, section 3, account by Nathan the Babylonian.</ref>

Under his leadership, the ancient academy of Sura founded by [[Abba Arikha]] entered upon a new period of brilliancy.<ref>Letter of Sherira Gaon.</ref> This renaissance was cut short by a clash between Saadia and David, much as Nissim had predicted.

In a probate case, Saadia refused to sign a verdict of the exilarch, which he thought unjust, although the Gaon of [[Pumbedita]] had subscribed to it. When the son of the exilarch threatened Saadia with violence to secure his compliance and was roughly handled by Saadia's servant, open war broke out between the exilarch and the gaon. Each [[Herem (censure)|excommunicated]] the other, declaring that he deposed his opponent from office. David ben Zakkai appointed Joseph ben Jacob Gaon of Sura and Saadia conferred the exilarchate on David's brother Hasan (Josiah; 930).

Hasan was forced to flee and died in exile in [[Greater Khorasan]], and the strife that divided Babylonian Judaism continued. Saadia was attacked by the exilarch and his chief adherent, the young but learned [[Aaron ibn Sargado]] (later Gaon of Pumbedita, 943-960), in Hebrew pamphlets. Fragments of these pamphlets show a hatred on the part of the exilarch and his partisans that did not shrink from scandal. Saadia did not fail to reply.

===Influence===
Saadia's influence upon the [[Jews of Yemen]] has been exceptionally great, as many of Saadia's extant works were preserved by the community and used extensively by them. The basis for the [[Baladi-rite prayer|Yemenite ''tiklāl'']] is founded upon the prayer format edited originally by Saadia.<ref name= "TobiY2000">{{cite book |editor-last1=Tobi|editor-first1=Yosef|editor-last2=Seri|editor-first2=Shalom|title=Yalqut Teman - Lexicon of Yemenite Jewry|publisher=E'eleh betamar |date=2000 |location=Tel-Aviv|page=190 |language=he |oclc=609321911}}</ref> The Yemenite Jewish community also adopted thirteen penitential verse written by Saadia for [[Yom Kippur]], as well as the liturgical poems composed by him for [[Hoshana Rabbah]], the seventh day of [[Sukkot]].<ref name= "TobiY2000" />

Saadia's Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch, the ''Tafsir'', was copied by the Yemenite Jews in nearly all their handwritten codices. They originally studied Saadia's major work of philosophy, ''Beliefs and Opinions'', in its original Judeo-Arabic,<ref name= "TobiY2000" /> although by the early 20th-century, only fragments survived.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saadia Gaon|author-link=Saadia Gaon|translator=Yosef Qafih|title=Book of Beliefs & Opinions (Sefer ha-Nivḥar ba-emunot uva-deʻot) |publisher=Mekhkon Mishnat ha-Rambam|year=2011|location=Kiryat Ono|page=5 |language=he|oclc=989874916}}</ref>

===Method of translation===
As much as Saadia's Judeo-Arabic translation of the [[Torah]] (''Tafsīr'') has brought relief and succour to Jews living in Arabic-speaking countries, his identification of places, fauna and flora, and the stones of the [[priestly breastplate]], has found him at variance with some scholars. [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], in his commentary on the Torah, wrote scathing remarks on Saadia's commentary,<ref>''Abraham ibn Ezra's Commentary of the Pentateuch'', on Genesis 2:11–12 and on Exodus 28:30, as well as in his critique on RSG's identification of the bird, ''ʿozniah'' (the [[Steppe eagle]]), in Leviticus 11:13.</ref> saying: "He doesn't have an oral tradition […] perhaps he has a vision in a dream, while he has already erred with respect to certain places […]; therefore, we will not rely on his dreams."

However, Saadia assures his readers elsewhere that when he rendered translations for the twenty-odd [[kosher animals|unclean fowl]] mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]], <small>([[Leviticus]] 11:13&ndash;19; [[Deuteronomy]] 14:12&ndash;18)</small> his translation was based on an [[oral tradition]] received by him.<ref>[[Zohar Amar]], ''Flora of the Bible'', Rubin Mass Ltd.: Jerusalem, p. 58 {{ISBN|978-965-09-0308-7|invalid1=yes}} {{oclc|783455868}} {{LCCN|2012426122}} (Hebrew); Yosef Qafih, ''Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Commentaries on the Pentateuch'', Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1984, p. [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzMzdN1V2iR8X1BZcFRnS284QWM/view 125 (note 7)] (Hebrew)</ref> Saadia's method of conveying names for the fowls based on what he had received by way of an oral tradition prompted him to add in his defense: "Every detail about them, had one of them merely come unto us [for identification], we would not have been able to identify it for certain, much less recognize their related kinds."<ref>[[Zohar Amar]], ''Flora of the Bible'', Rubin Mass Ltd.: Jerusalem, p. 59 {{ISBN|978-965-09-0308-7|invalid1=yes}} {{oclc|783455868}} {{LCCN|2012426122}} (Hebrew); Yosef Qafih, ''Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Commentaries on the Pentateuch'', Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1984, p. 125 (note 7) (Hebrew)</ref>

The question often asked by scholars now is whether Saadia applied this principle in his other translations. ''Re'em'' ({{langx|he|ראם|rəʾēm|link=no}}), as in [[V'Zot_HaBerachah#Third_reading—Deuteronomy_33:13–17|Deuteronomy 33:17]], improperly translated as "unicorn" in some English translations, is a word that is now used in [[Modern Hebrew]] to represent the "[[oryx]]." However, Saadia understood the same word to mean "[[rhinoceros]]" and writes there the Judeo-Arabic word for the creature ({{langx|jrb|אלכרכדאן|al-karkadann}}). He interprets the ''zamer'' ({{langx|he|זָֽמֶר|zāmer|link=no}}) in [[Re'eh#Fourth_reading—Deuteronomy_14:1–21|Deuteronomy 14:5]] as [[giraffe]].

In Saadia's translation and commentary on the ''[[Book of Psalms]]'' (''Kitāb al-Tasābiḥ''), he has done what no other medieval writer has done before him, bringing down a biblical [[exegesis]] and noting where the verse is to be read as a rhetorical question, and where the verse itself derides the question with good humor:
{{blockquote|
<poem>{{Script/Hebrew|

}} 
Is the hill of God the hill of Bashan? A hunchback mountain is the hill of Bashan! (Meaning, it is unfit for God's Divine Presence).
Why leap ye, ye hunchback mountains?
That mountain wherein God desires to dwell (i.e. Mount Moriah in Jerusalem), even the Lord shall dwell [therein] forever more.
</poem>

Saadia's approach to [[Biblical exegesis|rabbinic exegesis]] and midrashic literature was ambivalent. Although he adopted them in his liturgies, he did not recoil from denouncing them in his commentary on the Bible whenever he thought that they broke-away from the plain and ordinary meaning of the text.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tobi |first=Yosef|title=Sa'adia's Biblical Exegesis and his Poetic Practice |journal=Hebrew Annual Review|publisher=Ohio State University |volume=8|pages=241–257|date=1984|oclc=231040805|language=en}}; {{cite book|last=Ben-Shammai|first=Haggai |title=Leader's Project: Studies in the Philosophical and Exegetical Works of Saadya Gaon

In some instances, Saadia's biblical translations reflect his own rationale of difficult Hebrew words based on their lexical root, and he will, at times, reject the earlier [[Targum]] for his own understanding. For example, in Psalm 16:4, Saadia retracts from the Targum (translated): "They will multiply their goddesses<ref>English translation "goddesses" follows the Aramaic Targum of Psalm 16:4, where the word '''צלמניהון''' is used for '''עצבות''', the plural feminine form of עצבים (images; idols) found in Psalm 115:4, Psalm 135:15, among other places.</ref> ({{Langx|he|עַצְּבוֹתָם}}); they have hastened after some other thing; I shall not pour out their libations of blood, neither shall I take-up their names upon my lips," writing instead: "They will multiply their revenues (Judeo-Arabic:אכסאבהם); they have hastened after some other thing," etc.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saadia|author-link=Saadia Gaon |translator=Qafih, Yosef |translator-link=Yosef Qafih |title=Book of Psalms with a Translation and Commentary of Rabbi Saadia Gaon (תהלים עם תרגום ופירוש הגאון רבינו סעדיה בן יוסף פיומי זצ"ל)|date=2010|publisher=Makhon Moshe (Makhon Mishnat haRambam)|location=Kiryat-Ono |page=74 (Ps. 16:4) |language=he |oclc=741156698 }}</ref> Even where a certain explanation is given in the [[Talmud]], such as the Hebrew words {{Script/Hebrew|בד בבד}} in Exo. 30:34 (explained in ''[[Taanit (Talmud)|Taanit]]'' 7a as meaning "each spice pounded separately"), Saadia deviates from the rabbinic tradition in his Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch, in this case explaining its sense as "having them made of equal portions."<ref>{{cite book|last=Saadia Gaon|author-link=Saadia Gaon|title=Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Commentaries on the Pentateuch |editor=Yosef Qafih |editor-link=Yosef Qafih |edition=4 |year=1984|publisher=[[Mossad Harav Kook]]|location=Jerusalem|page=97 |language=he|oclc=232667032}}</ref>

In another apparent deviation from Talmudic tradition, where the Talmud (''Hullin'' 63a) names a biblical species of fowl <small>(Leviticus 11:18)</small> known as ''raḥam'' ({{langx|he|רחם}}) and says that it is the colorful [[European bee-eater]] called the ''sheraqraq'', Saadia in his Judeo-Arabic translation of the [[Humash]] writes that ''raḥam'' is the [[Egyptian vulture]] based on the phonetic similarity of its Arabic name with the Hebrew.<ref name= "Dalman2013">{{cite book |author-last=Dalman|author-first=Gustaf |author-link=Gustaf Dalman |title=Work and Customs in Palestine |volume=I/1 |translator=Nadia Abdulhadi Sukhtian |location=Ramallah|publisher=Dar Al Nasher |year=2013 |pages=168–169 (vol. 1) |language=en |url=https://www.amazon.com/Customs-Palestine-Translation-Gustaf-2013-08-02/dp/B01K3MCDFE |oclc=1040774903|isbn=9789950385-00-9}}</ref> The ''sheraqraq'' ({{langx|ar|شقراق|translit=šiqirrāq}}) is a bird that harbingers rain in the [[Levant]] (around October), for which reason the Talmud says: "When ''raḥam'' arrives, mercy (''raḥamīm'') comes into the world."<ref name= "Dalman2013"/>

===Later years===
He wrote both in Hebrew and in Arabic a work, now known only from a few fragments, entitled "Sefer ha-Galui" (Arabic title, "Kitab al-Ṭarid"), in which he emphasized with great but justifiable pride the services which he had rendered, especially in his opposition to heresy.

The fourteen years which Saadia spent in [[Babylonia]] did not interrupt his literary activity. His principal philosophical work was completed in 933; and four years later, through Ibn Sargado's father-in-law, Bishr ben Aaron, the two enemies were reconciled. Saadia was reinstated in his office; but he held it for only five more years. David b. Zakkai died before him (c. 940), being followed a few months later by the exilarch's son Judah, while David's young grandson was nobly protected by Saadia as by a father. According to a statement made by [[Abraham ibn Daud]] and doubtless derived from Saadia's son Dosa, Saadia himself died in [[Babylonia]] at [[Sura (city)|Sura]] in 942, at the age of sixty, of "black gall" (melancholia), repeated illnesses having undermined his health.

===Mention in Sefer Hasidim===
An anecdote is reported in ''[[Sefer Hasidim]]'' about Saadia ben Yosef "the sage," in which he ends a dispute between a servant who claims to be the heir of his deceased master and the man's true son and heir by having them both draw blood into separate vessels. He then took a bone from the deceased man and placed it into each of the cups. The bone in the cup of the true heir absorbed the blood, while the servant's blood was not absorbed in the bone. Using this as genetic proof of the son's true inheritance, Saadia had the servant return the man's property to his son.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg|title=ספר חסידים - יהודה בן שמואל, החסיד, 1146-1217 (page 73 of 228)|url=https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14561&st=&pgnum=73|access-date=31 October 2017|author1-link=Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg}}</ref>

Saadia Gaon was a pioneer in the fields in which he toiled. The foremost object of his work was the Bible; his importance is due primarily to his establishment of a new school of Biblical exegesis characterized by a rational investigation of the contents of the Bible and a scientific knowledge of the language of the holy text.

Saadia's Arabic translation of the [[Torah]] is of importance for the history of civilization; itself a product of the [[Arabization]] of a large portion of Judaism, it served for centuries as a potent factor in the impregnation of the Jewish spirit with Arabic culture, so that, in this respect, it may take its place beside the Greek Bible-translation of antiquity and the German translation of the Pentateuch by Moses Mendelssohn. As a means of popular religious enlightenment, Saadia's translation presented the Scriptures even to the unlearned in a rational form which aimed at the greatest possible degree of clarity and consistency.

His system of hermeneutics was not limited to the exegesis of individual passages, but treated also each book of the Bible as a whole, and showed the connection of its various portions with one another.

The commentary contained, as is stated in the author's own introduction to his translation of the Pentateuch, not only an exact interpretation of the text, but also a refutation of the cavils which the heretics raised against it. Further, it set forth the bases of the commandments of reason and the characterization of the commandments of revelation; in the case of the former the author appealed to philosophical speculation; of the latter, naturally, to tradition.

The position assigned to Saadia in the oldest list of Hebrew grammarians, which is contained in the introduction to [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]'s "Moznayim," has not been challenged even by the latest historical investigations. Here, too, he was the first; his grammatical work, now lost, gave an inspiration to further studies, which attained their most brilliant and lasting results in [[Spain]], and he created in part the categories and rules along whose lines was developed the grammatical study of the Hebrew language. His dictionary, primitive and merely practical as it was, became the foundation of Hebrew lexicography; and the name "Agron" (literally, "collection"), which he chose and doubtless created, was long used as a designation for Hebrew lexicons, especially by the Karaites. The very categories of rhetoric, as they were found among the Arabs, were first applied by Saadia to the style of the Bible. He was likewise one of the founders of comparative philology, not only through his brief "Book of Seventy Words," already mentioned, but especially through his explanation of the Hebrew vocabulary by the Arabic, particularly in the case of the favorite translation of Biblical words by Arabic terms having the same sound.

Saadia's works were the inspiration and basis for later Jewish writers, such as [[Berachyah]] in his encyclopedic philosophical work ''Sefer Hahibbur'' (The Book of Compilation).

Saadia likewise identifies the definitive trait of "[[fighting cock|a cock girded about the loins]]" within Proverbs 30:31 ([[Douay–Rheims Bible]]) as "the honesty of their behavior and their success",<ref>PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18 - Michael V. Fox - Yale University Press 2009 - 704 pages</ref> rather than the [[aesthetic]] interpretations of so many others, thus identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious and spiritual instilling schema of purpose and use.

==Relations to mysticism==
In his commentary on the [[Sefer Yetzirah]], Saadia sought to render lucid and intelligible the content of this esoteric work by the light of philosophy and scientific knowledge, especially by a system of Hebrew phonology which he himself had founded. He did not permit himself in this commentary to be influenced by the theological speculations of the [[Kalam]], which are so important in his main works. In introducing Sefer Yetzirah's theory of creation he makes a distinction between the Biblical account of [[creation ex nihilo]], in which no process of creation is described, and the process described in Sefer Yetzirah (matter formed by speech). The cosmogony of Sefer Yetzirah is even omitted from the discussion of creation in his magnum opus "Kitab al-Amanat wal-I'tiḳadat." Concerning the supposed attribution of the book to the patriarch [[Abraham]], he allows that the ideas it contains might be ancient. Nonetheless, he clearly considered the work worthy of deep study and echoes of Sefer Yetzirah's cosmogony do appear in "Kitab al-Amanat wal-I'tiḳadat" when Saadia discusses his theory of prophecy.

===Hebrew linguistics===
# ''[[Agron (dictionary)|Agron]]''
# ''[[Kutub al-Lughah]]'', also known as ''Kitāb faṣīḥ lughat al-‘ibrāniyyīn'', “The Book of Eloquent Language of the Hebrews”<ref>Aron Dotan, ''Or Rišon Beḥokhmat ha-Lašon'', Jerusalem 1997.</ref>
# "Tafsir al-Sab'ina Lafẓah," a list of seventy (properly ninety) Hebrew (and Aramaic) words which occur in the [[Hebrew Bible]] only once or very rarely, and which may be explained from traditional literature, especially from the Neo-[[Hebraism]]s of the [[Mishnah]]. This small work has been frequently reprinted.

===Halakhic writings===
# Short monographs in which problems of Jewish law are systematically presented. Of these Arabic treatises, little but the titles and extracts is known, and it is only in the "Kitab al-Mawarith" that fragments of any length have survived.
# A commentary on the thirteen rules of [[Rabbi Ishmael]], preserved only in a Hebrew translation by [[Nahum Ma'arabi]]. An Arabic methodology of the Talmud is also mentioned, by [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai|Azulai]], as a work of Saadia under the title "Kelale ha-Talmud".
#[[Responsa]]. With few exceptions these exist only in Hebrew, some of them having been probably written in that language.
# The [[Siddur of Saadia Gaon]] (''Kitāb jāmiʿ al-ṣalawāt wal-tasābīḥ''), containing the texts of the prayers, commentary in Arabic and original synagogal poetry. Of this synagogal poetry the most noteworthy portions are the "Azharot" on the 613 commandments, which give the author's name as "Sa'id b. Joseph", followed by the title "Alluf," thus showing that the poems were written before he became gaon.

===Philosophy of religion===
# [[Emunoth ve-Deoth]] (''Kitāb al-amānāt wa-al-iʿatiqādāt''), the ''Book of Beliefs and Opinions'':<ref>This (כתאב אלאמאנאת ואלאעתקאדאת [Judeo-Arabic]) was the name of Saadia's first edition, later emended by Saadia to אלמכ'תאר פי אלאמאנאת ואלאעתקאדאת (Hebrew: הנבחר באמונות ובדעות) as described by [[Yosef Qafih|Kafih]] on pages 8-9 of his edition (https://www.otzar.org/wotzar/book.aspx?12163&lang=eng).</ref> This work, first compiled in 933 CE, of which several revisions were made until its final redaction,<ref>{{cite book|last=Saadia Gaon|author-link=Saadia Gaon|translator=Yosef Qafih|title=Book of Beliefs & Opinions (Sefer ha-Nivḥar ba-emunot uva-deʻot) |publisher=Mekhkon Mishnat ha-Rambam|year=2011|location=Kiryat Ono|page=6 (Introduction)|language=he|oclc=989874916}}</ref> is considered to be the first systematic attempt to synthesize the Jewish tradition with philosophical teachings. Prior to Saadia, the only other Jew to attempt any such  fusion was [[Philo]] {{Harv|Ivry|1989}}. Saadia's objective here was to show the parallelism between the truths delivered to the people of Israel by Divine revelation, on the one side, and the necessary conclusions that can also be reached by way of rational observation, on the other. The effect of these ideas expressed in his philosophical books are clearly reflected in Saadia's story of creation, especially when he comes to deal with the theological problems, such as in the verse of Deuteronomy 4:24: “For the LORD your God is a devouring fire,” which constitutes an example of a verse that cannot be understood in its plain context, but should rather be understood in such a way as not to contradict one's definite knowledge that God does not change, nor can anything corporeal be associated with him.<ref>Ayelet Cohen, ''Linguistic Comments in Saadia's Biblical Commentary'' (Abstract), Haifa University 2017</ref> 
# ''Tafsīr Kitāb al-Mabādī'',<ref>Saadia Gaon's version of the text itself along with his Judeo-Arabic commentary with facing Hebrew translation by Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih|Yosef Kafih]] (https://www.otzar.org/wotzar/book.aspx?23506&lang=eng [first 40 pages viewable for free]).</ref> an Arabic translation of and commentary on the [[Sefer Yetzirah]], written while its author was still residing in Egypt (or Israel), and intended to explain in a scientific manner how the universe came into existence.<ref>''Sefer Yetzirah Hashalem'' (with Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Commentary), [[Yosef Qafih]] (editor), Jerusalem 1972, p. 46 (Hebrew / Judeo-Arabic)</ref> On the linguistic aspect, Saadia combines a debate on the letters and on their attributes (e.g. phonemes), as well as a debate on related linguistic matters.

===Polemical writings===
# Refutations of Karaite authors, always designated by the name "Kitab al-Radd," or "Book of Refutation." These three works are known only from scanty references to them in other works; that the third was written after 933 is proved by one of the citations.
# "Kitab al-Tamyiz" (in Hebrew, "Sefer ha-Hakkarah"), or "Book of Distinction," composed in 926, and Saadia's most extensive polemical work. It was still cited in the twelfth century; and a number of passages from it are given in a Biblical commentary of [[Japheth ha-Levi]].
# There was perhaps a special polemic of Saadia against Ben Zuta, though the data regarding this controversy between is known only from the gaon's gloss on the Torah.
# A refutation directed against the rationalistic Biblical critic [[Hiwi al-Balkhi]], whose views were rejected by the Karaites themselves;
# "Kitab al-Shara'i'," or "Book of the Commandments of Religion."
# "Kitab al-'Ibbur," or "Book of the Calendar," likewise apparently containing polemics against Karaite Jews;
# "Sefer ha-Mo'adim," or "Book of Festivals," the Hebrew polemic against Ben Meir which has been mentioned above.
# "Sefer ha-Galui," also composed in Hebrew and in the same flowery biblical style as the "Sefer ha-Mo'adim," being an autobiographical and apologetic work directed against the Exilarch (''rosh galuth''), David b. Zakkai, and his chief patron, Aharon ibn Sargado, in which he proved his own uprightness and equity in the matter of controversy between them.
