'''Felix Weltsch''' (6 October 1884, [[Prague]] &ndash; 9 November 1964, [[Jerusalem]]) was a [[German language|German]]-speaking [[Jew]]ish librarian, philosopher, author, editor, publisher and journalist. A close friend of [[Max Brod]], [[Ludwig Winder]] and [[Franz Kafka]], he was one of the most important [[Zionism|Zionists]] in [[Bohemia]].

==Life==
Born in [[Prague]] (then in [[Austria-Hungary]]), Weltsch studied Law and Philosophy at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität|Charles University]]. He lived and worked in Prague until 15 March 1939, and left the city with [[Max Brod]] and his family on the last train out of [[Czechoslovakia]]. In what at his arrival was [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and later the state of [[Israel]], he worked as a librarian in [[Jerusalem]] until his death in 1964.

He had one daughter, Ruth Weltsch (1920–1991), with his wife Irma Herz (1892–1969). They married in August 1914. The publisher, journalist and Zionist [[Robert Weltsch]] was Felix Weltsch's cousin, and the Prague-born concert pianist [[Alice Herz-Sommer]], who performed in and survived [[Theresienstadt]] at her death the world's oldest Holocaust survivor, was his sister-in-law. His grandson, [[Eli Gorenstein]] is an actor, cellist and among Israel's leading voice dubbers.

==Influence==
Weltsch's works deal with the subjects of Ethics, Politics and Philosophy. For his ethical and political publications he received the Ruppin-Prize from the city of [[Haifa]] in 1952. His most important work was the Jewish-Zionist weekly paper ''Selbstwehr'' (self-defense), which he led from 1919 until 1938. With this work and hundreds of articles he became one of the most important personalities in Jewish life next to [[Martin Buber]], [[Chaim Weizmann]] and [[Hugo Bergmann]], his early school friend.
