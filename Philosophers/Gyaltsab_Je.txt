'''Gyaltsab Je''' ({{Bo-tw|t=རྒྱལ་ཚབ་རྗེ་|w=Rgyal tshab rje}}) (1364 – 1432) or more elaborately, Gyaltsab Dharma Rinchen was born in the Tsang province of central [[Tibet]]. He was a famous student of [[Je Tsongkhapa]], and actually became the first [[Ganden Tripa]] (throne holder) of the [[Gelug]] tradition after Je Tsongkhapa's death. He also studied with Rendawa Zhonnu Lodro (red mda' ba gzhon nu blo gros, 1349–1412).

Gyaltsab Je was a prolific writer; one of his most famous texts is a commentary of Shantideva's ''[[A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way Of Life]]''.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia
