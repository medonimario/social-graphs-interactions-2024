He served more than 30 years as a [[professor]] at [[Princeton University]].

He is renowned as a [[scholar]] and translator of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He also wrote a 1965 book on [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and published a translation of [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']], and [[Martin Buber]]'s ''[[I and Thou]]''.

==Philosophical work==
In a 1959 article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', he summarily rejected all religious values and practice, especially the liberal [[Protestantism]] of [[continental Europe]] that began with [[Schleiermacher]] and culminated in the writings of [[Paul Tillich]] and [[Rudolf Bultmann]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://walterkaufmann.com/articles/1959_Faith_of_Heretic.pdf|title=Faith of a Heretic|author=Kaufmann, Walter|date=February 1959|work=[[Harper's Magazine]]|access-date=July 9, 2015}}</ref> In their place, he praised moralists such as the [[bible|biblical]] [[Nevi'im|prophets]], the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and [[Socrates]]. He argued that [[critical analysis]] and the acquisition of [[knowledge]] were [[emancipation|liberating]] and [[empowerment|empowering]] forces. He forcefully criticized the fashionable [[Liberal Christianity#Liberal Protestantism|liberal Protestantism]] of the 20th century as filled with contradictions and evasions, preferring the austerity of the [[book of Job]] and the [[Jewish existentialism]] of [[Martin Buber]]. Kaufmann discussed many of these issues in his 1958 ''Critique of Religion and Philosophy''.

Kaufmann wrote a good deal on the [[existentialism]] of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Karl Jaspers]]. Kaufmann had great admiration for Kierkegaard's passion and his insights on [[freedom]], [[anxiety]], and [[individualism]].<ref name="Kierkegaard">Kaufmann, W (1980).''Discovering the Mind: Goethe, Kant, and Hegel.'' New York: McGraw-Hill Co., p.26</ref> Kaufmann wrote: "Nobody before Kierkegaard had seen so clearly that the freedom to make a fateful decision that may change our character and future breeds anxiety."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315125312|title=Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Buber|last=Kaufmann|first=Walter|date=2017-09-29|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351502955|language=en|chapter=Kierkegaard as Psychologist|doi=10.4324/9781315125312|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rcs3DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT52|editor1-last=Kaufmann|editor1-first=Walter}}</ref> Although Kaufmann did not share Kierkegaard's religious outlook and was critical of his [[Protestantism#Theology|Protestant theology]], Kaufmann was nevertheless sympathetic and impressed with the depth of Kierkegaard's thinking:

{{quote|I know of no other great writer in the whole nineteenth century, perhaps even in the whole of world literature, to whom I respond with less happiness and with a more profound sense that I am on trial and found wanting, unless it were Søren Kierkegaard.<ref name="Kierkegaard2">{{cite book |last=Kaufmann |first=W. |date=1961 |title=Religion From Tolstoy To Camus |publisher=Harper and Brothers |page=3}}</ref>}}

Kaufmann edited the anthology ''Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre''. Kaufmann disliked [[Martin Heidegger]]'s thinking, along with his unclear writing.<ref>[[Denis Dutton]], "[http://www.denisdutton.com/heidegger.htm Kaufmann, Heidegger, and Nazism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060404105532/http://www.denisdutton.com/heidegger.htm |date=2006-04-04 }}" ''Philosophy and Literature'' 12 (1988): 325–36</ref>

Kaufmann is renowned for his translations and exegesis of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], whom he saw as gravely misunderstood by English speakers, as a major early [[existentialist]], and as an unwitting precursor, in some respects, to Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy]]. Michael Tanner called Kaufmann's commentaries on Nietzsche "obtrusive, self-referential, and lacking insight",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/nietzschepastmas00mich/page/84|title=Nietzsche|last=Tanner|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-19-287680-5|pages=84}}</ref> but [[Llewellyn Jones]] wrote that Kaufmann's "fresh insights into ... Nietzsche ... can deepen the insights of every discriminating student of literature,"<ref>[[Llewellyn Jones|Jones, Llewellyn]], ''[[The Humanist]],''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=FksTAAAAIAAJ Volume 21] (1961) quoted on [https://books.google.com/books?id=fLj1cQDlVWcC&pg=PA458 the back cover] of Kaufmann, Walter Arnold, ''From Shakespeare to Existentialism'' (Princeton University Press 1979),</ref> and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that Kaufmann "has produced what may be the definitive study of Nietzsche's ... thought—an informed, scholarly, and lustrous work."<ref>Kaufman, Walter Arnold, ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'' (Princeton University Press 1974), on [[iarchive:nietzschephiloso0000kauf/page/n553|back cover]], {{ISBN|0-691-01983-5}}, accessed 2012-Jul-29</ref>

In his ''[[Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist]]'' (1950) Kaufmann wrote that 

{{quote|It is evident at once that Nietzsche is far superior to Kant and Hegel as a stylist; but it also seems that as a philosopher he represents a very sharp decline — and men have not been lacking who have not considered him a philosopher at all — because he had no “system.” Yet this argument is hardly cogent. Schelling and Hegel, Spinoza and Aquinas had their systems; in Kant’s and Plato’s case the word is far less applicable; and of the many important philosophers who very definitely did not have systems one need only mention Socrates and many of the pre-Socratics. Not only can one defend Nietzsche on this score — how many philosophers today have systems? — but one must add that he had strong philosophic reasons for not having a system.<ref>{{cite book| last=Kaufman| first=Walter| title=Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=1974| pages=79| isbn=0-691-01983-5| url=https://archive.org/details/nietzschephiloso0000kauf/page/79/mode/1up| access-date=December 17, 2008}}</ref>}}

Kaufmann also sympathized with Nietzsche's acerbic [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Christianity and morality|criticisms of Christianity]]. However, Kaufmann faulted much in Nietzsche, writing that "my disagreements with [Nietzsche] are legion."<ref>{{cite book| last=Kaufman| first=Walter| title=Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Buber: Discovering the Mind, Volume 2| publisher=Princeton University Press| date=1980| pages=6| isbn=0-88738-394-7| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qLGtL7XOjgC| access-date=December 20, 2008}}</ref> Regarding style, Kaufmann argued that Nietzsche's ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', for example, is in parts badly written, melodramatic, or verbose, yet concluded that the book "is not only a mine of ideas, but also a major work of literature and a personal triumph."<ref>Kaufmann, Walter (1976), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=blfwSlxhjvAC&pg=PT70 Editor's Preface]" to ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', in ''The Portable Nietzsche'', New York: Penguin Books, pp. 120–124. {{ISBN|0-14-015062-5}}</ref>

Kaufmann described his own [[ethic]] and his own [[philosophy of life|philosophy of living]] in his books, including ''The Faith of a Heretic'' (1961) and ''Without Guilt and Justice: From Decidophobia to Autonomy'' (1973). In the former work he advocated living in accordance with what he proposed as the four cardinal virtues: "humbition" (a fusion of [[humility]] and ambition), [[love]], [[courage]], and [[honesty]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kaufmann |first=Walter Arnold |url=https://archive.org/details/faithofheretic00kaufrich/page/304/mode/1up |title=The Faith of a Heretic |date=1963 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City |pages=304-305, 304-329 |ol=13574757M |quote=My own ethic is not absolute but a morality of openness.  It is not a morality of rules but an ethic of virtues... The first lacks any single name but is a fusion of humility and aspiration.  Humility consists in realizing one’s stark limitations and remembering that one may be wrong.  But humility fused with smugness, with complacency, with resignation is no virtue to my mind.  What I praise is not the meekness that squats in the dust, content to be lowly, eager not to stand out, but humility winged by ambition.  There is no teacher of humility like great ambition.  Petty aspirations can be satisfied and may be hostile to humility.  Hence, ambition and humility are not two virtues: taken separately, they are not admirable.  Fused, they represent the first cardinal virtue.  Since there is no name for it we shall have to coin one-at the risk of sounding humorous: humbition. |url-access=registration}}</ref>
