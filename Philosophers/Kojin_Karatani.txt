==Biography==

Karatani entered the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1960, where he joined the radical Marxist [[Communist League (Japan)|Communist League]], better known as "[[Communist League (Japan)|The Bund]]," and participated in the massive [[Anpo protests|1960 Anpo protests]] against the [[U.S.-Japan Security Treaty]], which he would later come to view as a formative political experience.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hioe |first1=Brian |last2=Small |first2=Houston |title=There Is No Such Thing as Japanese Marxism: An Interview with Kojin Karatani |journal=Platypus Review |issue=71 |date=November 2014 |access-date=June 11, 2021 |url=https://platypus1917.org/2014/11/01/platypus-review-issue-71-article-1/}}</ref>

Karatani graduated with a [[Bachelor's degree|B.A.]] in [[economics]] in 1965, and added an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in [[English literature]] in 1967. The Gunzō Literary Prize, which he received at the age of 27 for an essay on [[Natsume Sōseki]], was his first critical acclaim as a literary critic. While teaching at [[Hosei University]], Tokyo, he wrote extensively about modernity and postmodernity with a particular focus on language, number, and money, concepts that form the subtitle of one of his central books: ''Architecture as Metaphor''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

In 1975, he was invited to [[Yale University]] to teach [[Japanese literature]] as a [[visiting professor]], where he met [[Paul de Man]] and [[Fredric Jameson]] and began to work on [[Formalism (literature)|formalism]]. He started from a study of Natsume Sōseki.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Karatani collaborated with novelist [[Kenji Nakagami]], to whom he introduced the works of [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]. With Nakagami, he published  ''Kobayashi Hideo o koete'' (''Overcoming Kobayashi Hideo''). The title is an ironic reference to “Kindai no chokoku” (''Overcoming Modernity''), a symposium held in the summer of 1942 at Kyoto Imperial University (now [[Kyoto University]]) at which [[Hideo Kobayashi]] (whom Karatani and Nakagami did not hold in great esteem) was a participant.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

He was also a regular member of [[ANY (conference)|ANY]], the international architects' conference that was held annually for the last decade of the 20th century and that also published an architectural/philosophical series with Rizzoli under the general heading of ''Anyone''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Since 1990, Karatani has been regularly teaching at [[Columbia University]] as a visiting professor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Karatani founded the [[:ja:New Associationist Movement|New Associationist Movement]] (NAM) in Japan in the summer of 2000.<ref>Harootunian, Harry. "Out of Japan: The New Associationist Movement". ''[[Radical Philosophy]]''. Issue 108 (July/August 2001). Retrieved 21 Mar. 2009. {{cite web |url=http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2187&editorial_id=9899 |title=Radical Philosophy - Commentaries - July/August 2001 |access-date=2008-09-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416092300/http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2187&editorial_id=9899 |archive-date=2007-04-16 }}</ref> NAM was conceived as a counter–capitalist/nation-state association, inspired by the experiment of LETS ([[Local Exchange Trading Systems]], based on non-marketed currency). He was also the co-editor, with [[Akira Asada]], of the Japanese quarterly journal ''Hihyōkūkan'' (''Critical Space''), until it ended in 2002.

In 2006, Karatani retired from the chair of the International Center for Human Sciences at [[Kinki University]], [[Osaka]], where he had been teaching.

In 2022, Karatani was awarded the $1 million Berggruen Prize for Culture and Philosophy.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.noemamag.com/japanese-philosopher-kojin-karatani-awarded-the-2022-berggruen-prize/ | title=Japanese Philosopher Kojin Karatani Awarded the 2022 Berggruen Prize | date=16 December 2022 | last1=Gardels | first1=Nathan }}</ref>

== Philosophy ==
Karatani has produced philosophical concepts, such as "the will to [[architecture]]", which he calls the foundation of all Western thinking,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bookoblivion.com/2019/11/14/kojin-karatani-will-to-architecture/|title=Kojin Karatani on the Will to Architecture|last=Manuel|first=Jessica S.|date=2019-11-14|website=Book Oblivion|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> but the best-known of them is probably that of "Transcritique", which he proposed in his book ''Transcritique'', where he reads [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] through [[Marx]] and vice versa. Writing about ''Transcritique'' in the ''New Left Review'' of January–February 2004, [[Slavoj Žižek]] brought Karatani's work to greater critical attention. Žižek borrowed the concept of "[[parallax]] view" (which is also the title of his review) for the title of his own book.

Karatani has interrogated the possibility of a ([[Paul de Man|de Manian]]) deconstruction and engaged in a dialogue with [[Jacques Derrida]] at the Second International Conference on Humanistic Discourse, organized by the [[Université de Montréal]]. Derrida commented on Karatani's paper "Nationalism and Ecriture" with an emphasis on the interpretation of his own concept of [[écriture]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pum.umontreal.ca/revues/surfaces/vol5/derrida.html |title=Jacques Derrida, Introduction to Kōjin Karatani's "Nationalism and Ecriture" |access-date=2006-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501070435/http://www.pum.umontreal.ca/revues/surfaces/vol5/derrida.html |archive-date=2008-05-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
