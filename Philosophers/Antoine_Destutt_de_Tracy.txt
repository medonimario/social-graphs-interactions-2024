'''Antoine Louis Claude Destutt, comte de Tracy''' ({{IPA|fr|dɛstyt də tʁasi|lang}}; 20 July 1754 – 9 March 1836) was a French [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] and [[philosopher]] who coined the term "[[ideology]]".

== Biography ==
The son of a distinguished soldier, Claude Destutt, he was born in [[Paris]]. His family was of Scottish descent, tracing its origin to Walter Stutt, who had accompanied the Earls of Buchan and Douglas to the court of France in 1420 and whose family afterwards rose to be counts of Tracy. He was educated at home and at the [[University of Strasbourg]], where he was noted for his athletic skill. He went into the army and when the [[French Revolution]] broke out he took an active part in the provincial assembly of Bourbonnais. Elected a deputy of the nobility to the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]], he sat alongside his friend, the [[Marquis de La Fayette]]. In the spring of 1792, he received the rank of ''[[maréchal de camp]]'' in command of the cavalry in the army of the north, but the influence of the extremists becoming predominant he took indefinite leave of absence and settled at [[Auteuil, Paris|Auteuil]], where with [[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet]] and [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]] he devoted himself to scientific studies.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Tracy, Antoine Louis Claude Destutt, Comte de |volume=27 |pages=126–127 }}</ref> Under the [[Reign of Terror]], he was arrested and imprisoned for nearly a year, during which he studied [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] and [[John Locke]] and abandoned the natural sciences for philosophy.<ref name="EB1911"/>

In 1795, he was named associate of the [[Institut de France]] when it was first established.<ref name="Byrnes2010">{{cite book|author=Joseph F. Byrnes|title=Catholic and French Forever: Religious and National Identity in Modern France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ayrAG5YjUEC&pg=PA83|year=2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04779-9|page=83}}</ref> On the motion of Cabanis, he was named in the class of the moral and political sciences. He soon began to attract attention by the memoires which he read before his colleagues—papers which formed the first draft of his comprehensive work on [[ideology]], named ''Eléments d'idéologie''. He conceived of ideology as the "science of ideas". The society of "ideologists" at Auteuil embraced, besides Cabanis and Tracy, [[Constantin-François de Chassebœuf, Comte de Volney]] and [[Dominique Joseph Garat]], professor in the National Institute.<ref name="EB1911"/> Along with some of these colleagues, he was a member of the cultural society ''[[Les Neuf Sœurs]]''. In 1806, he was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in [[Philadelphia]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Antoine+L.C.+Desturr+de+Tracy&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-04-01|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>

Under the [[First French Empire|Empire]], Tracy was a member of the senate, but he took little part in its deliberations. Under the [[Bourbon Restoration in France|Restoration]], he became a [[peer of France]], but protested against the reactionary split of the government and remained in opposition. In 1808, he was elected a member of the [[Académie française]] in place of Cabanis and in 1832 was also named a member of the Academy of Moral Sciences on its reorganization. He appeared only once at its conferences, owing to his age and to disappointment at the comparative failure of his work. Destutt de Tracy was one of the principal advocates of [[liberalism]] during and after the Revolution. He died in [[Paris]].<ref name="EB1911"/>

== Philosophy ==
[[File:David d'Angers - Destutt de Tracy.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Destutt de Tracy by [[David d'Angers]] (1837)]]
Destutt de Tracy was the last eminent representative of the [[Sensualism|sensualistic]] school which Condillac founded in France upon a one-sided interpretation of Locke. In full agreement with the materialist views of Cabanis, de Tracy pushed the sensualist principles of Condillac to their most necessary consequences. While the attention of Cabanis was devoted mostly to the physiological side of man, Tracy's interests concerned the then newly determined "ideological", in contrast to "psychological", sides of humanity. His grounding notion of ideology, he frankly stated, should be classified as "a part of zoology" (biology). The four faculties into which de Tracy divides the conscious life—perception, memory, judgment and volition—are all varieties of sensation. Perception is sensation caused by a present affection of the external extremities of the nerves; memory is sensation caused in the absence of present excitation by dispositions of the nerves which are the result of past experiences; judgment is the perception of relations between sensations and is itself a species of sensation because if we are aware of the sensations we must be aware also of the relations between them; and volition he identifies with the feeling of desire and is therefore included as a type of sensation.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Considered for the influences of his philosophy, de Tracy minimally deserves credit for his distinction between active and passive touch which ultimately fed the development of psychological theories of muscular sense. His account of the notion of external existence as being derived not from pure sensation, but from the experience of action on the one hand and resistance on the other, stands in this light to be compared with the works of [[Alexander Bain (philosopher)|Alexander Bain]] and later psychologists.<ref name="EB1911"/>

His chief works are the five-volume ''Éléments d'idéologie'' (1817–1818), the first volume of which was presented as "Ideology Strictly Defined" and which completed the arguments made in earlier completed monographs; ''Commentaire sur l'esprit des lois de Montesquieu'' (1806) and ''Essai sur le génie, et les ouvrages de Montesquieu'' (1808).<ref name="EB1911"/> The fourth volume of the ''Eléments d'idéologie'' the author regarded as the introduction to a ''second'' section of the planned nine-part work<ref>Tracy, Antoine Louis Claude Destutt de, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EzpdAAAAcAAJ A Treatise on Political Economy]'', trans. edited by Thomas Jefferson (Georgetown: Joseph Milligan, 1817; reprinted New York: Augustus M.

== Legacy ==
Tracy advanced a rigorous use of deductive method in social theory, seeing economics in terms of actions ([[praxeology]]) and exchanges ([[catallactics]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Klein |first=Daniel |title=Deductive economic methodology in the French Enlightenment: Condillac and Destutt de Tracy |journal=[[History of Political Economy]] |year=1985 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=51–71 |doi=10.1215/00182702-17-1-51 |s2cid=145372504 }}</ref> Tracy's influence can be seen both on the Continent (particularly on [[Stendhal]], [[Augustin Thierry]], [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Charles Dunoyer]]) and in the United States, where the general approach of the [[French Liberal School]] of political economy competed evenly with British [[Classical economics|classical political economy]] well until the end of the 19th century as evidenced in the work and reputation of [[Arthur Latham Perry]] and others. In his political writings<ref>de Tracy, Antoine Louis Claude Destutt, ''A Commentary and Review of Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws'', trans. Thomas Jefferson (1811) (New York: Burt Franklin, 1969)</ref> Tracy rejected [[monarchism]], favoring the American republican form of government. This [[republicanism]] as well as his advocacy of [[reason]] in philosophy and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' for economic policy lost him favor with [[Napoleon]], who turned Tracy's coinage of "ideology" into a term of abuse. [[Karl Marx]] followed this vein of invective to refer to Tracy as a "fischblütige Bourgeoisdoktrinär" (a "fish-blooded bourgeois doctrinaire").<ref>{{Cite web |title=Narratives Across Border |url=https://www.cambridgescholars.com/resources/pdfs/978-1-4438-8811-0-sample.pdf |website=cambridgescholars.com |access-date=24 November 2023}} Introduction, p. 6.</ref>

On the other hand, [[Thomas Jefferson]] thought highly enough of Destutt de Tracy's work to ready two of his manuscripts for American publication. In his preface to the 1817 publication, Jefferson wrote: "By diffusing sound principles of Political Economy, it will protect the public industry from the parasite institutions now consuming it".<ref>Campbell, Willisam F. "[http://www.phillysoc.org/campwilm.htm Liberty, Peace, and Self-Interest Properly Understood] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908093412/http://www.phillysoc.org/campwilm.htm |date=September 8, 2008 }}", speech before The Philadelphia Society, Regional Meeting, Wilmington, Delaware, October 10, 1998.</ref> Tracy's criticism of [[Montesquieu]] and his endorsement of representative democracy were influential on Jefferson's thinking.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dahl|first1=Robert|title=On Democracy|url=https://archive.org/details/ondemocracy00dahl|url-access=registration|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|page=[https://archive.org/details/ondemocracy00dahl/page/104 104]|isbn=9780300076271 }}</ref>

[[Stendhal]] was much influenced by Tracy's enlightenment ideals and attended the de Tracy salon regularly in the 1820s as he described in ''[[Memoirs of an Egotist]]''.<ref>Matthew Josephison, ''Stendhal'', p. 277</ref> According to Richard Stites, he was important to the liberals of the 1820s:
<blockquote>[[Franco Venturi]] noted that the ''Commentary'' "resounded throughout the whole period of the liberal revolutions, from the Spain of 1820 to the Russia of 1825." An American historian wrote that "the [[Decembrist revolt|Russian Decembrists]], along with numerous other liberals, ''[[Carbonari]]'', and [[Revolutions during the 1820s|revolutionaries of the 1820s]] used this ''Commentary'' as their political Bible." The Decembrist Mikhail Orlov recalled that his circle considered it "the epitome of wisdom."<ref>Richard Stites, ''The Four Horsemen: Riding to Liberty in Post-Napoleonic Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 2014; {{ISBN|0199978085}}), p. 13.</ref></blockquote>
