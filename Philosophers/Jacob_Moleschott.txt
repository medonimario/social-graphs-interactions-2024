'''Jacob Moleschott''' (9 August 1822 – 20 May 1893) was a Dutch [[physiologist]] and writer on nutrition and [[dietetics]]. He was known for his philosophical and political positions in regard to [[scientific materialism]] and against [[vitalism]]. He saw a need for scientists to engage in political thinking. He was a member of [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]] (since 1884). Although born in the Netherlands, he studied in Germany and later wrote extensively in Italian, especially on "scienza positiva".

Jacobus Albertus Willebrordus Moleschott was born in [['s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Netherlands]], to physician Jo(h)annes Franciscus Gabriel Moleschott (1793-1857) and Elizabeth Antonia (or Antonetta) van der Monde (1795-1866).<ref>Meneghello (2017):40.</ref> He went to school at [[Kleve|Cleves]], and here he learnt Greek and Latin and was encouraged by the school director Ferdinand Helmke. His Latin and Greek teacher Moritz Fleischer also introduced him to Hegelian philosophy.<ref>Meneghello (2017):44.</ref> Moleschott's father had been skeptical of religion and discouraged his son from religion and encouraging the natural sciences at an early age. Moleschott studied medicine at [[Heidelberg University]] unlike his father who went to Leiden. He studied botany under [[Theodor Ludwig Wilhelm von Bischoff|Theodor Bischoff]] and chemistry from [[Friedrich Wilhelm Hermann Delffs|Wilhelm Delff]]. Anatomy was taught by [[Friedrich Tiedemann]] (1781-1861) and physiology by [[Leopold Gmelin]] (1788-1853).<ref>Meneghello (2017):47.</ref> His supervisor was [[Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle|Jacob Henle]], where he obtained his PhD in 1845. During this period he also became active in a circle of Johann Christian Kapp. He met [[Justus von Liebig|Justus Liebig]] in Giessen and [[Lorenz Oken]] in Bern and began to form networks. He translated [[Gerardus Johannes Mulder|Johannes Mulder]]'s work which he gifted to [[Gabriel Valentin|Gabriel Gustav Valentin]] in Bern. He passed on Valentin's work to Tiedemann. He moved to [[Utrecht]] in 1845 and became an assistant to Mulder. He discussed the physiology of vision with [[Franciscus Donders|Franciscus Cornelis Donders]] (1818-1889).<ref>Meneghello (2017):57-60.</ref>  He soon moved back to Heidelberg University taking an interest in Mulder's work on nutrition and working as a Privatdozent. Moleschott was also interested in socialism as being helpful in bettering the nutrition of people. A debate between Liebig and Mulder strained Moleschott's relationship with Liebig. Liebig held that carbohydrates alone acted as fuel for the body while Moleschott included the roles of protein and fat.<ref>Meneghello (2017):77.</ref> He lectured on [[physiology]] starting in 1847 and published ''Physiologie der Nahrungsmittel'' (1850) which received praise including from [[Alexander von Humboldt]].<ref>Meneghello (2017):82.</ref> He also gave special emphasis to experimental methods. He then extended it with a series of public lectures open to all dealing with anthropology through experimental methods.<ref>Meneghello (2017):63.</ref>  The university under orders from the Interior Ministry of Baden reprimanded Moleschott for his radical political position, "brutal materialism" and atheism leading to his resignation in 1854.<ref>Meneghello (2017):86-88.</ref> Next to [[Carl Vogt]] and [[Ludwig Büchner]], Moleschott stood in the center of the public debates about [[materialism]] in Germany in the 1850s.<ref>[[Andreas Daum|Daum]], ''Wissenschaftspopularisierung'', pp. 210, 293–99, 355, 379, 415–6, 426, 443, 456–57, 503.</ref>

Moleschott spent two years without an academic post and began to work on the 15-volume ''Untersuchungen zur Naturlehre des Menschen und der Thiere''.<ref>Meneghello (2017):92.</ref> He also wrote a biography of Georg Forster who he described as a people's scientist.<ref>Meneghello (2017):97.</ref> In 1856 a cookbook that proved to be popular by Wilhelmine Rührig titled ''Frankfurter Kochbuch'', later as ''Kochbuch fürʼs Deutsche Haus'' was based on the nutritional theories of Liebig and Moleschott.<ref>Meneghello (2017):122.</ref> Moleschott advised the consumption of proteins on a daily basis. Another woman Mathilde Reichardt-Stromberg wrote an essay on morality through rational thought rather than religion using Moleschott's ''Kreislauf des Lebens''.<ref>Meneghello (2017):123.</ref> Moleschott received a position in the University of Zurich as a professor of physiology in 1856. He and his wife learned Italian while in Zurich.  He then moved to [[University of Turin|Turin]] (1861) where he was particularly active in building networks between Swiss, German and Italian researchers. In 1867 he received Italian citizenship. He continued to popularize science and physiology in particular. In 1876 he was appointed as a Senator. In 1878 he moved to La Sapienza in [[Sapienza University of Rome|Rome]] (1879) as professor of experimental physiology.<ref>Meneghello (2017):224-225.</ref> He used his political position to support a lawyer's position for Lidia Poët who had been refused on the ground of being a woman.<ref>Meneghello (2017):229-240.</ref> He also opposed anti-semitism<ref>Meneghello (2017):240-245.</ref> as well as the Macinato or grist tax.<ref>Meneghello (2017):306-308.</ref> On June 9, 1889 he gave a public talk on the inauguration of a statue of [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Vatican alongside a speech by Gaetano Trezza (1828-1892). He supported the role of rational thought against the intolerance of the Church.<ref>Meneghello (2017):338-348.</ref> 

Moleschott married Sophie Strecker in 1849 and they had two sons and three daughters. She was an amateur poet and helped edit Moleschott's works. She suffered from melacholia in Italy and committed suciide in 1891.<ref>Meneghello (2017):70-71.</ref> Moleschott died in Rome.

A bronze bust by [[Ettore Ferrari]] was installed in the University of Turin on June 9, 1893, with a commemorative speech by [[Cesare Lombroso]] who had translated Moleschott's ''Kreislauf des Lebens'' into Italian.<ref>Meneghello (2017):394-408.</ref>

== Writings ==
Moleschott explained the origin and condition of animals by the working of physical causes. He was an [[atheist]] which led to his removal from teaching at the Heidelberg University.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Science and Culture of Nutrition, 1840-1940|year=1995|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-5183-818-3|author=Harmke Kamminga|page=31|quote=Moleschott's atheism is much more prominent, for example, and he declares absurd Liebig's opinion that insights into the laws of nature inevitably lead us to the notion of a Being knowable only through revelation.}}</ref> His characteristic formulae were "no thought without [[phosphorus]]" and "the brain secretes thought as the liver secretes [[bile]]."
