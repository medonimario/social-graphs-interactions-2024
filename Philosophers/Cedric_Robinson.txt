He headed the Department of Black Studies and the Department of Political Science. He served as the Director of the Center for Black Studies Research. Robinson's areas of interest included classical and modern [[political philosophy]], [[Left-wing politics|radical]] [[social theory]] in the [[African diaspora]], [[comparative politics]], [[racial capitalism]], and the relationships between and among [[media and politics]].

==Early life==
Robinson was given the name Cedric James Hill when he was born on November 5, 1940, in [[Alameda County, California]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/cedric_james_hill_born_1940_2233038 |title=The Birth of Cedric Hill |website=California Birth Index}}</ref> in Oakland, California. He grew up in Oakland there. He attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[social anthropology]] in 1963, and [[Stanford University]], where he received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in political theory in 1974.

He became a political [[activist]] during his student days, when he protested against the university administration and American foreign and domestic policies along with other Black radical students.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://readingfanon.blogspot.co.za/2016/06/cedric-j-robinson-making-of-black.html |title=Cedric J. Robinson: the Making of a Black Radical Intellectual |first=Robin |last=Kelley |website=The Frantz Fanon Blog: Reading Frantz Fanon in Grahamstown, South Africa |date=June 2016}}</ref> He was part of the [[Afro-American Association]] at Berkeley, a student group that discussed Black identity, African decolonization, historical and contemporary racism, and related topics.<ref name=":0" />

Robinson's grandfather, Winston "Cap" Whiteside, influenced his radical political views. His grandfather was forced to flee after defending his wife Cecilia, Robinson's future grandmother, from an abusive boss in their hometowns of [[Mobile, Alabama]] and decided to go to California during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] in the 1920s. Robinson named [[C. L. R. James]] and [[Terence Hopkins]] as other thinkers who shaped his political outlook.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://readingfanon.blogspot.co.za/2016/11/robin-d-g-kelly-revisiting-black.html |title=Revisiting Black Marxism in the Wake of Black Lives Matter |first=Robin |last=Kelley |website=The Frantz Fanon Blog: Reading Frantz Fanon in Grahamstown, South Africa |date=2016-11-01}}</ref>

==Career and public service==
After leaving Berkeley, Robinson was drafted into the U.S. Army and also worked at the Alameda County Probation Department.<ref>{{Cite magazine |first=Robin D. G. |last=Kelley |date=Winter 2017 |title=What Did Cedric Robinson Mean by Racial Capitalism? |url=https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/robin-d-g-kelley-introduction-race-capitalism-justice/ |access-date=2022-10-25 |magazine=[[Boston Review]] |issue=1, ''Race, Capitalism, Justice'' |language=en-US}}</ref> From 1971 to 1973, Cedric was a lecturer in Political Science and Black Studies at the [[University of Michigan]]. In 1973, Cedric accepted his first tenure-track job at [[Binghamton University]]–State University of New York. In 1978, Robinson joined the [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and became director of the Center for Black Studies Research.

In 1980, trying to correct what they saw as overall media bias as well as media laziness in accepting what the White House, the [[US State Department]], and [[The Pentagon]] said about the [[Third World]] and American relations with it, Robinson and UCSB student Corey Dubin started ''[[Third World News Review]]'' (''TWNR'') on the campus and community radio station, [[KCSB-FM|KCSB]]. Five years later the program became available on [[public access television]]. Since 1980, UCSB students from the [[Third World]] and other UCSB faculty members have contributed to the program, produced it, or both.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Elizabeth |last=Robinson |title=Twenty-five years of the Third World News Review |journal=Race & Class |date=October 2005 |volume=47 |number=2, ''Cedric Robinson and the philosophy of Black resistance'' |pages=78|doi=10.1177/0306396805058084 }}</ref>

The author of five books, Robinson also had articles appear in academic journals and anthologies on subjects ranging from political thought in the United States, [[Africa]], and the [[Caribbean]] to [[Western world|Western]] social theory, film, and the press.
