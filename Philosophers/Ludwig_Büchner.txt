'''Friedrich Karl Christian Ludwig Büchner''' (29 March 1824 – 30 April 1899) was a German [[philosopher]], [[physiologist]] and [[physician]] who became one of the exponents of 19th-century [[scientific materialism]].

==Biography==
Büchner was born at [[Darmstadt]] on 29 March 1824. From 1842 to 1848 he studied [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[mineralogy]], [[philosophy]] and [[medicine]] at the [[University of Giessen]], where he graduated in 1848 with a dissertation entitled ''Beiträge zur Hall'schen Lehre von einem excitomotorischen Nervensystem'' (''Contributions to the [[Hallerian physiology|Hallerian Theory]] of an Excitomotor Nervous System''). Afterwards, he continued his studies at the [[University of Strasbourg]], the [[University of Würzburg]] (where he studied [[pathology]] with the great [[Rudolf Virchow]]) and the [[University of Vienna]]. In 1852 he became lecturer in [[medicine]] at the [[University of Tübingen]], where he published his magnum opus ''Kraft und Stoff: Empirisch-naturphilosophische Studien'' (''Force and Matter: Empiricophilosophical Studies'', 1855).<ref>Available online at [https://archive.org/details/kraftundstoff02bcgoog archive.org].</ref> Büchner was one of the founding members of the [[Freies Deutsches Hochstift]] (Free German Foundation).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lerner |first=Franz |date=1960 |title=Die ersten Mitglieder des Freien Deutschen Hochstifts |journal=Archiv für Frankfurts Geschichte und Kunst |volume=47 |pages=63–74}}</ref>

According to [[Friedrich Albert Lange]] (''[[Geschichte des Materialismus]]'', 1866), ''Kraft und Stoff'' was imbued with a fanatical enthusiasm for humanity. Büchner sought to demonstrate the indestructibility of [[matter]], and the finality of physical [[force]]. The [[scientific materialism]] of this work, which contemporaries often lumped together with the publications of other 'materialists' like [[Carl Vogt|Karl Vogt]] and [[Jacob Moleschott]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Daum|title=Wissenschaftspopularisierung|pages=173–75, 210–14, 296–98, 456–58, 478–79.}}</ref> caused so much opposition that he was compelled to give up his post at Tübingen, and he retired to [[Darmstadt]]. He practiced as a physician and contributed regularly to pathological, physiological and popular magazines.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He continued his philosophical work in defense of materialism, and published ''Natur und Geist'' (''Nature and Spirit'', 1857), ''Aus Natur und Wissenschaft'' (''From Nature and Science'', vol. I., 1862; vol. II., 1884), ''Der Fortschritt in Natur und Geschichte im Lichte der Darwinschen Theorie'' (''Progress in Nature and History in the Light of the [[Darwinian]] Theory'', 1884), ''Tatsachen und Theorien aus dem naturwissenschaftlichen Leben der Gegenwart'' (''Facts and Theories in the Scientific Life of Present'', 1887), ''Fremdes und Eigenes aus dem geistligen Leben der Gegenwart'' (''Strangers and Selves in the Spiritual Life of the Present'', 1890), ''Darwinismus und Socialismus'' (''Darwinism and Socialism'', 1894), ''Im Dienste der Wahrheit'' (''In the Service of Truth'', 1899).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Ludwig Büchner's materialism was the founding ground for the [[Freethought|freethinker]]s' movement in Germany. In 1881 he founded in [[Frankfurt]] the "[[German Freethinkers League]]" ("Deutsche Freidenkerbund"). Being politically active, Büchner was a member of the second chamber of the   Landstände of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] as a representative of the [[German Free-minded Party]] from 1884 to 1890.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hessische Parlamentarismusgeschichte – Zugang zu Quellen & Materialien |url=https://parlamente.hessen.de/abgeordnete,%20https://parlamente.hessen.de/abgeordnete/118667939-buechner-ludwig |access-date=2023-12-12 |website=Hessische Parlamentarismusgeschichte |language=de}}</ref> 

He died at Darmstadt on 30 April 1899.<ref name=death>[[:s:en:Page:The Zoologist, 4th series, vol 3 (1899).djvu/306|This death announcement]], in ''[[The Zoologist]]'', [[:s:en:The Zoologist, 4th series, vol 3 (1899)|4th series, vol. 3 (1899)]], issue 696, p. 280, gives 30 April as the date of death.</ref>

==Philosophical work==
In estimating Büchner's philosophy it must be remembered that he was primarily a [[physiologist]], not a [[metaphysics|metaphysician]]. Matter and force (or [[energy]]) are, he maintained, [[Infinity|infinite]]; the [[Conservation of energy|conservation of force]] follows from the [[Conservation of matter|imperishability of matter]], the ultimate basis of all science.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Büchner is not always clear in his theory of the relation between matter and force. At one time he refuses to explain it, but generally he assumes that all natural and spiritual forces are indwelling in matter. Just as a [[steam engine]], he says in ''Kraft und Stoff'' (7th ed., p.&nbsp;130), produces [[motion (physics)|motion]], so the intricate [[organic (model)|organic]] complex of force-bearing substance in an animal organism produces a total sum of certain effects, which, when bound together in a unity, are called by us [[mind]], [[soul]], [[thought]]. Here he postulates force and mind as emanating from original matter, a materialistic [[monism]]. But in other parts of his works he suggests that mind and matter are two different aspects of that which is the basis of all things, a monism which is not necessarily materialistic.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Büchner was much less concerned to establish a scientific metaphysics than to protest against the romantic [[idealism]] of his predecessors and the [[theology|theological]] [[cosmology|interpretations of the universe]]. [[Nature]] according to him is purely physical; it has [[teleology|no purpose]], no will, no laws imposed by extraneous [[authority]], no [[supernatural]] [[ethics|ethical]] sanction.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Büchner endorsed [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Darwinism|theory of evolution]] within a decade of its first issuance, writing the book ''Man in the Past, Present and Future'' in 1869 about what he felt were Darwinism's implications. He believed that this included humanity moving into a kinder state of being, where a primitive [[struggle for life]] would no longer apply or at least be replaced with purely intellectual struggles, and war would end. To achieve this, Büchner advocated government social programs which would aid greater equality, including the [[collective ownership]] of land and [[women's rights]] (however he did not extend this to them receiving [[Women's suffrage|suffrage]], deeming that premature at the time).<ref>''Social Darwinism in European and American Thought, 1860-1945 Nature as Model and Nature as Threat'', Mike Hawkins, Cambridge University Press, 1997, pp.75-77</ref>

Büchner, together with [[Edward Aveling]], had attended the congress of the "International Federation of Freethinkers" held in London from 25 to 27 September 1881, the following day they visited Darwin on 28 September. Aveling published a full account of his visit in the National Reformer in 1882.<ref>"A Visit to Charles Darwin" The National Reformer, Vol. XL.—No.18. NS., October 22, 1882,pp.[273]-274.</ref>

Modern Christian apologists consider Büchner the father of atheistic evangelism in Germany, a counterpart to [[Thomas Huxley]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}
