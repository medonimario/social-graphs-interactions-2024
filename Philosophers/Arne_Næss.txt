'''Arne Dekke Eide Næss''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|n|ə|_|ˈ|n|ɛ|s}}, {{respell|AR|nə|_|NESS}}; {{IPA|no-NO-03|ˈɑ̂ːɳə ˈdɛ̂kːə ˈæ̂ɪdə ˈnɛsː|lang}}; 27 January 1912 &ndash; 12 January 2009) was a Norwegian philosopher who coined the term "[[deep ecology]]", an important intellectual and inspirational figure within the [[environmental movement]] of the late twentieth century, and a prolific writer on many other philosophical issues.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C. |title=Arne Næss (1912–2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=527–530 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1 |id={{ProQuest|775562345}} |doi-access=free}}</ref> Næss cited [[Rachel Carson]]'s 1962 book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' as being a key influence in his vision of deep ecology. Næss combined his ecological vision with Gandhian [[nonviolence]] and on several occasions participated in [[direct action]].

Næss averred that while western environmental groups of the early [[post–World War II]] period had raised public awareness of the environmental issues of the time, they had largely failed to have insight into and address what he argued were the underlying cultural and philosophical background to these problems. Næss believed that the [[environmental crisis]] of the twentieth century had arisen due to certain unspoken philosophical presuppositions and attitudes within modern western developed societies which remained unacknowledged.<ref name="luke"/>

He thereby distinguished between what he called ''deep'' and ''shallow'' ecological thinking. In contrast to the prevailing utilitarian pragmatism of western businesses and governments, he advocated that a true understanding of nature would give rise to a point of view that appreciates the value of [[biological diversity]], understanding that each living thing is dependent on the existence of other creatures in the complex web of interrelationships that is the natural world.<ref name="luke">{{cite journal |last=Luke |first=Timothy W. |title=Deep ecology: Living as if nature mattered |journal=Organization & Environment |date=June 2002 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=178–186 |doi= 10.1177/10826602015002005|s2cid=145359287 }}</ref>

==Life and career==
Næss was born in Slemdal, Oslo, Norway, the son of Christine (Dekke) and Ragnar Eide Næss.<ref>{{cite web |title=Arne Dekke Eide Næss/Else Marie Hertzberg |website=www.boslekt.com |url=http://www.boslekt.com/html/fam291xx/fam29101.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317034541/http://www.boslekt.com/html/fam291xx/fam29101.htm |archive-date=2016-03-17 |access-date=2021-09-17}}</ref> Ragnar was a successful banker, and Arne was the younger brother of shipowner [[Erling Dekke Næss]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Anonymous |title=Philosopher and Mountaineer |newspaper=The Gazette (Montreal, QC) |date=27 January 2009 |page=B7 |quote=Arne Dekke Eide Naess was born on January 27, 1912, the son of Ragnar Naess, a successful banker. His father died prematurely within a year of Arne's birth. The family home was at Vettakollen near Oslo, and there the young Arne was brought up by his mother and elder brother Erling, who later became a major shipowner.}}</ref> Næss had two children with his first wife Else and was the uncle of mountaineer and businessman [[Arne Næss Jr.]] (1937–2004).<ref name="guardian"/>

In 1939, Næss was the youngest person to be appointed full professor at the [[University of Oslo]] and the only professor of philosophy in the country at the time.{{sfn|Krabbe|2010|p=527}}

He was a noted mountaineer, who in 1950 led the expedition that made the first ascent of [[Tirich Mir]] ({{Convert|7708|m|ft|disp=or}}) in [[Pakistan]],{{sfn|Krabbe|2010|p=529}} depicted in the documentary film ''[[Tirich Mir til topps]]''. The Tvergastein hut in the [[Hallingskarvet]] massif played an important role in the name of Næss's philosophy, "Ecosophy T", as "T" is said to represent his mountain hut Tvergastein.{{sfn|Krabbe|2010|p=529}}{{sfn|Næss|1989|p=4}}

In 1958, he founded the interdisciplinary journal of philosophy ''[[Inquiry: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Philosophy|Inquiry]]''.{{sfn|Krabbe|2010|p=529}}

[[File:Arnenass28aug2003.jpg|thumb|Næss campaigning for the Norwegian Green party in 2003]]
In 1970, together with a large number of protesters, he chained himself to rocks in front of [[Mardalsfossen]], a waterfall in a Norwegian [[fjord]], and refused to descend until plans to build a dam were dropped.<ref name="guardian"/> Though the demonstrators were carried away by police and the dam was eventually built, the demonstration launched a more activist phase of Norwegian environmentalism.<ref name="guardian"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Seed |first1=John |last2=Macy |first2=Joanna |author-link2=Joanna Macy |last3=Fleming |first3=Pat |last4=Næss |first4=Arne |date=1988 |title=Thinking Like a Mountain: Towards a Council of All Beings |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=[[New Society Publishers]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/thinkinglikemoun0000unse/page/119 119] |isbn=0865711321 |oclc=18611536 |url=https://archive.org/details/thinkinglikemoun0000unse/page/119 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

When he was 61, he met Kit Fai, who was four decades younger and whom he later married.<ref name="guardian"/>

In 1996, he won the [[Swedish Academy Nordic Prize]], known as the "little Nobel". In 2005 he was decorated as a Commander with Star of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] for socially useful work. Næss was a minor political candidate for the [[Green Party (Norway)|Norwegian Green Party]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/01/10/stortingsvalg/tab-2005-10-27-18.html |title=Storting Election 2005.

Næss died on 12 January 2009, at the age of 96.<ref name="guardian"/>

==Philosophy==
Næss's book ''[[Erkenntnis und wissenschaftliches Verhalten]]'' (1936) anticipated many themes familiar in post-war [[analytic philosophy]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hannay |first=Alastair |author-link=Alastair Hannay |chapter=Norwegian Philosophy |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |editor-link=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |edition=1st |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford; New York |year=1995 |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/627 627] |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc=31239158 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/627 }}</ref>

In the 21st century, Næss came to be recognized by newer generations of philosophers as a pioneer of {{em|[[experimental philosophy]]}} (a term that Næss himself used) for his empirical semantics research.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Appiah |first=Kwame Anthony |author-link=Kwame Anthony Appiah |date=November 2008 |title=Experimental philosophy |journal=[[Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association]] |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=7–22 |jstor=27654052 |url=http://appiah.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/APA-Lecture-2007-for-Web.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Plakias |first=Alexandra |date=February 2015 |title=Experimental philosophy |journal=[[Oxford Handbooks Online]] |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935314.013.17 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Taylor Shaw |date=2014 |chapter=Experimental philosophy, 1935–1965 |editor1-last=Knobe |editor1-first=Joshua |editor1-link=Joshua Knobe |editor2-last=Lombrozo |editor2-first=Tania |editor3-last=Nichols |editor3-first=Shaun |editor3-link=Shaun Nichols |title=Oxford Studies in Experimental Philosophy |volume=1 |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages=325–368 |isbn=9780198718772 |oclc=898058805 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198718765.003.0013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Chapman |first=Siobhan |date=September 2018 |title=The experimental and the empirical: Arne Naess' statistical approach to philosophy |journal=[[British Journal for the History of Philosophy]] |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=961–981 |doi=10.1080/09608788.2017.1336075|s2cid=148886287 }}</ref> One of Næss's early publications on experimental philosophy was ''"Truth" as Conceived by Those Who Are Not Professional Philosophers'' (1938).{{sfn|Næss|1938}}

Næss's main philosophical work from the 1950s was entitled ''Interpretation and Preciseness'' (1953).{{sfn|Næss|1953}} This was an application of [[set theory]] to the problems of language interpretation, extending the work of semanticists such as [[Charles Kay Ogden]] in ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]''. A simple way of explaining it is that any given utterance (word, phrase, or sentence) can be considered as having different potential interpretations, depending on prevailing language norms, the characteristics of particular persons or groups of users, and the language situation in which the utterance occurred. These differing interpretations are to be formulated in more precise language represented as subsets of the original utterance. Each subset can, in its turn, have further subsets (theoretically ad infinitum). The advantages of this conceptualisation of interpretation are various. It enables systematic demonstration of possible interpretation, making possible evaluation of which are the more and less "reasonable interpretations". It is a logical instrument for demonstrating language vagueness, undue generalisation, conflation, pseudo-agreement and effective communication.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eriksson |first=Darek |title=Phenomeno-semantic complexity: A proposal for an alternative notion of complexity as a foundation for the management of complexity in human affairs |journal=Emergence: Complexity and Organization |year=2007 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=11–21 |issn=1521-3250}}</ref>

Næss developed a simplified, practical textbook embodying these advantages, entitled ''Communication and Argument: Elements of Applied Semantics'' (1966),{{sfn|Næss|1966}} which became a valued introduction to this pragmatics or "language logic", and was used over many decades as a ''[[sine qua non]]'' for the preparatory examination at the [[University of Oslo]], later known as ''examen philosophicum'' ("exphil").{{sfn|Krabbe|2010|p=528}}<ref name=Malkomsen>{{cite thesis |type=Masters thesis |last=Malkomsen |first=Olav Langhammer |date=May 2011 |title=Universitetet – en institusjon for dannelse?: En sammenlignende studie av studieopplegg ved et norsk og amerikansk universitet |trans-title=The university – an institution for education?: A comparative study of study programs at a Norwegian and American university |location=Oslo |publisher=Department of Sociology and Social Geography, [[University of Oslo]] |pages=37–41 |oclc=746999057 |url=https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-28544 |language=no}}</ref>

===Recommendations for public debate<!--This section is linked from [[Civil discourse]] and [[Rogerian argument]]: do not rename without including an anchor to previous name ([[MOS:HEAD]])-->===
{{See also|Civil discourse|Pragma-dialectics#Rules for critical discussion}}
Næss's book ''Communication and Argument'' (1966) included his recommendations for objective [[public debate]].{{sfn|Næss|1966|pp=121–135}} Næss argued for adhering to the following principles to make discussions as fruitful and pleasant as possible:{{sfn|Næss|1966|pp=121–135}}{{sfn|Krabbe|2010|p=529}}
# "Avoid tendentious references to side issues"—distractions such as [[personal attack]]s, claims about opponents' motivation, or irrelevant explanations or arguments.
# "Avoid tendentious renderings of other people's views"—editing quotes or paraphrasing in a biased or misleading way (for example, [[quoting out of context]]).
# "Avoid tendentious [[ambiguity]]"—deliberately offering ambiguous statements instead of more precise ones ([[equivocation]]).
# "Avoid tendentious argument from alleged implication"—assigning views to opponents that they do not hold ([[Straw man|straw men]]).
# "Avoid tendentious firsthand reports"—information that is untrue or incomplete, withholding relevant information (for example, [[lying by omission]]).
# "Avoid tendentious use of contexts"—presenting material with extra accessories of persuasion and suggestion such as visual or aural [[Appeal to emotion|appeals to emotion]] of irony, sarcasm, insult, exaggeration, or subtle (or open) threat.

For many years these points were part of a compulsory course in [[philosophy]] (''examen philosophicum'') taught in Norwegian universities.{{sfn|Krabbe|2010|p=528}}<ref name=Malkomsen/>

[[Argumentation theory|Argumentation theorist]] Erik Krabbe later said that Næss's principles for effective discussion were precursors of the [[Pragma-dialectics#Rules for critical discussion|rules for critical discussion in pragma-dialectics]].{{sfn|Krabbe|2010|p=529}}

===Ecosophy T===
Ecosophy T, as distinct from deep ecology, was originally the name of Næss's personal philosophy. Others such as [[Warwick Fox]] have interpreted deep ecology as a commitment to [[ecosophy]] T, Næss's personal beliefs. The "T" referred to Tvergastein, a mountain hut where he wrote many of his books, and reflected Næss's view that everyone should develop his own philosophy.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Murray |last1=Bookchin |first2=Graham |last2=Purchase |first3=Brian |last3=Morris |first4=Rodney |last4=Aitchtey |first5=Robert |last5=Hart |first6=Chris |last6=Wilbert |title=Deep Ecology & Anarchism: A Polemic |location=London |publisher=Freedom Press |date=1993 |isbn=0900384670 |oclc=28182962}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2021}}

Næss's ecosophy can be summed up as [[self-realization]]. According to Næss, every being, whether [[human]], [[animal]] or [[vegetable]], has an equal right to live and to blossom.{{sfn|Næss|1989|pp=164–65}} Næss states that through self-realization humans can become part of the ecosystems of Earth, in distinction to becoming only themselves.{{Explain|date=May 2017|reason=This needs a more thorough explanation.}} According to one writer, Næss defined the ethical consequences of self-realization as: If one does not know how the outcomes of one's actions will affect other beings, one should not act.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Luke |first=Timothy |title=Deep ecology: Living as if nature mattered |journal=Organization and Environment |date=June 2002 |volume=15|issue=2 |pages=178–186 |doi= 10.1177/10826602015002005 |s2cid=145359287 }}</ref>

In an article that summarized Næss's career, [[Nina Witoszek]] noted that he qualified his most radical propositions using the rhetorical term "in principle", and he pragmatically recognized that, in Witoszek's words, "concessions are unavoidable; dogmas are ductile; and practice diverges from principle".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Witoszek |first=Nina |author-link=Nina Witoszek |date=February 2010 |title=The death of the philosopher king and the crisis of our time |journal=[[Environmental Values]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 (3) |jstor=30302328 |doi=10.3197/096327110X485356}}</ref>
