== Philosophical work ==

Cartwright's approach to the [[philosophy of science]] is associated with the "[[Stanford School]]" of [[Patrick Suppes]], [[John Dupré]], [[Peter Galison]] and [[Ian Hacking]]. It is characterized by an emphasis on scientific practice as opposed to abstract scientific theories. Cartwright has made important contributions to debates on [[scientific law|laws of nature]], [[causality|causation]] and [[causal inference]], scientific models in the natural and social sciences, [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and the [[unity of science]]. Her recent work focuses on [[evidence]] and its use in informing policy decisions.

Carl Hoefer describes Cartwright's philosophy in the following terms:<ref>Hartmann, Stephann, Hoefer, Carl and Luc Bovens (eds.) - Nancy Cartwright's Philosophy of Science. London: Routledge. 2008. p. 14.</ref>
{{blockquote|
Nancy Cartwright's philosophy of science is, in her view, a form of empiricism but empiricism in the style of [[Otto Neurath|Neurath]] and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], rather than of [[David Hume|Hume]] or [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]. Her concerns are not with the problems of [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], [[problem of induction|induction]], or [[problem of demarcation|demarcation]]; she is concerned with how actual science achieves the successes it does, and what sort of metaphysical and epistemological presuppositions are needed to understand that success.

Cartwright, like many working scientists themselves, takes a rather pragmatic/realist stance toward observations and interventions made by scientists and engineers and particularly toward their connections to causality: Scientists see impurities causing signal loss in a cable, and they stimulate an inverted population, causing it to lase. Given these starting points, there can be no question of a skeptical attitude toward [[Causality|causation]], in either singular or generic form. The fundamental role (or better, roles) played by causation in scientific practice is undeniable; what Cartwright does, then, is reconfigure [[empiricism]] from the ground up based on this insight. In the reconfiguration process, many mainstays of the received view of science take a beating; especially [...] the fundamentality of [[scientific law|laws of nature]].
