==Early life and educationy==
Vaihinger was born in [[Nehren, Baden-Württemberg|Nehren]], [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]], Germany, near [[Tübingen]], and raised in what he described as a "very religious atmosphere".<ref name="as if" />{{rp|xxiii}}  He was educated at the [[University of Tübingen]] (the [[Tübinger Stift]]), [[Leipzig University]], and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]].  

==Career==
Vaihinger became a tutor and later a philosophy professor at the [[University of Strasbourg]]. In 1884  he moved to the [[University of Halle]], where from 1892 he was a full professor.
==Personal life and death==
By 1900 Vaihinger’s health had deteriorated. His health, especially his failing eyesight, forced Vaihinger to step down from his professorship. In 1926 Vaihinger suffered complete blindness. Vaihinger died  on December 18 1933.

==Work==
In ''Die Philosophie des Als Ob'', Vaihinger argued that human beings can never really know the underlying reality of the world, and that as a result people construct systems of thought and then assume that these match reality: they behave "as if" the world matches their models. In particular, he used examples from the physical sciences, such as [[proton]]s, [[electron]]s, and [[electromagnetic wave]]s.  None of these phenomena has been observed directly, but science assumes and pretends that they exist, and uses observations made on these assumptions to create new and better constructs.<ref name="as if" />

Vaihinger acknowledged several precursors, especially Kant,<ref name="as if" />{{rp|vii–ix, xxiii–xlviii}} and [[Hermann Lotze]] and wrote that he felt vindicated by [[Friedrich Albert Lange]],<ref name="as if" />{{rp|XIII}} but had been unaware of [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s ''Theory of Fictions'' until, at the very end of his life, it was brought to his attention by his translator, [[Charles Kay Ogden|C. K. Ogden]].<ref name="as if" />{{rp|v–vi}}<ref>Ogden edited Bentham's work:  {{cite book|last=Ogden|first=C. K.|title=Bentham's Theory of Fictions|location=Paterson, NJ|publisher=Littlefield, Adams|year=1959}}  Ogden comments: "There is no doubt that Hans Vaihinger reached his conclusions independently of Bentham ...  The chief defect of Vaihinger's monumental work was its failure to lay stress on the linguistic factor in the creation of fictions." (p. xxxii).</ref> 

In the preface to the English edition of his work, Vaihinger expressed his ''principle of [[fictionalism]]'':  "An idea whose theoretical untruth or incorrectness, and therewith its falsity, is admitted, is not for that reason practically valueless and useless; for such an idea, in spite of its theoretical nullity[,] may have great practical importance."<ref name="as if" />{{rp|viii}} Moreover, Vaihinger denied that his philosophy was a form of [[skepticism]] because skepticism implies a doubting, whereas in his 'as if' philosophy the acceptance of patently false fictions is justified as a pragmatic non-rational solution to problems that have no rational answers.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/37587/philosophy-of-as-if ''Philosophy of As If''.] Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.</ref>

Fictions in this sense, however, Vaihinger considers to be only "half-fictions or semi-fictions". Rather, "real fictions" are those that "are not only in contradiction with reality but self-contradictory in themselves;  the concept of the atom, for example, or the '[[Ding an sich]]'."  However, the two types "are not sharply divided from one another but are connected by transitions.  Thought begins with slight initial deviations from reality (half-fictions), and, becoming bolder and bolder, ends by operating with constructs that are not only opposed to the facts but are self-contradictory."<ref name="as if" />{{rp|16}}

This philosophy, though, is wider than just science.  One can never be sure that the world will still exist tomorrow, but one usually assumes that it will.  [[Alfred Adler]], the founder of Individual Psychology, was profoundly influenced by Vaihinger's theory of useful fictions, incorporating the idea of psychological fictions into his personality construct of a [[fictional final goal#Fictional final goal|fictional final goal]].

Vaihinger’s philosophy of 'as if' can be viewed as one of the central premises upon which [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly's]] [[personal construct psychology]] is based. Kelly credited Vaihinger with influencing his theory, especially the idea that our constructions are better viewed as useful hypotheses rather than representations of objective reality. Kelly wrote: "Vaihinger's 'as if' philosophy has value for psychology (...) Vaihinger began to develop a system of philosophy he called the "philosophy of 'as if' ". In it he offered a system of thought in which God and reality might best be represented as paradigms. This was not to say that either God or reality was any less certain than anything else in the realm of man’s awareness, but only that all matters confronting man might best be regarded in hypothetical ways".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=George A.|title=The Language of Hypothesis: Man's Psychological Instrument|journal=Journal of Individual Psychology|volume=20|issue=2|pages=137–52}}</ref>

[[Frank Kermode]]'s ''The Sense of an Ending'' (1967) was an early mention of Vaihinger as a useful methodologist of narrativity. He says that "literary fictions belong to Vaihinger’s category of 'the consciously false.' They are not subject, like hypotheses, to proof or disconfirmation, only, if they come to lose their operational effectiveness, to neglect."<ref>{{cite book|last=Kermode|first=Frank|title=The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction with a New Epilogue|location=New York|publisher=Oxford U.P.|year=1967|page=40}}</ref>

Later, [[James Hillman]] developed both Vaihinger and Adler's work with psychological fictions into a core theme of his work ''Healing Fiction'' in which he makes one of his more accessible cases for identifying the tendency to literalize, rather than "see through our meanings", with neurosis and madness.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hillman|first=James|title=Healing Fiction|url=https://archive.org/details/healingfiction00hill|url-access=registration|location=Barrytown, NY|publisher=Station Hill P.|year=1983|page=[https://archive.org/details/healingfiction00hill/page/110 110]}}</ref>

==Critical reception and legacy==
During his own lifetime Vaihinger's works were generally well received both in Germany and abroad, especially in America. When, in 1924, his ''Philosophy of As If'' was published in English, the original 1911 book was already in its sixth edition. However, the American journalist [[H.L. Mencken|Mencken]] was scathing in his criticism of the book, which he dismissed as an unimportant "foot-note to all existing systems".<ref>Mencken,  H.L. (1924) ''Philosophers as Liars''. [[The American Mercury]], October, Vol III, No. 10, pp. 253–55.</ref> Vaihinger was also criticised by the [[Logical positivism|Logical positivists]] who made "curt and disparaging references" to his work.<ref name="fine">Fine, A. (1993) [http://faculty.washington.edu/afine/Fictionalism.pdf ''Fictionalism'']. Midwest Studies in Philosophy 18 (1):1–18.</ref>

After his death, and the intellectual sea change that followed the Second World War, Vaihinger's work received little attention from philosophers.<ref name="fine" /> It was left to psychologists such as Kelly and writers such as Kermode to draw upon his central ideas. However, the interest of literary scholars has continued modestly with the publication of some recent "Vaihinger-inflected critical literature".<ref>Stampfl, B. (1998) [http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/criticism/vol40/iss3/5 ''Hans Vaihinger' s Ghostly Presence in Contemporary Literary Studies'']. Criticism: Vol. 40: Iss. 3, Article 5.</ref> A reappraisal of Vaihinger by the American philosopher [[Arthur Fine]] concluded that Vaihinger was actually the "preeminent twentieth-century philosopher of modeling".<ref name="fine" /> Vaihinger's influence has since markedly increased, and the currently booming fictionalism movement in the philosophy of science takes his contributions as its main historical lead and inspiration.<ref>Suárez, M. (2009) [http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415887922 "Fictions in Science. Philosophical Essays on Modelling and Idealisation"]. Routledge.</ref>
