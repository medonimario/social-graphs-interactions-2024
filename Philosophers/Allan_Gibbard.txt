'''Allan Fletcher Gibbard''' (born 1942) is the [[Richard B. Brandt]] [[Distinguished University Professor]] of [[Philosophy]] [[Emeritus]] at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gibbard/Vita.pdf|title=Allan Gibbard Vita|access-date=4 June 2023}}</ref> Gibbard has made major contributions to contemporary [[ethics|ethical]] theory, in particular [[metaethics]], where he has developed a contemporary version of [[non-cognitivism]]. He has also published articles in the [[philosophy of language]], [[metaphysics]], and [[social choice theory]]: in social choice, he first proved the result known today as [[Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem]],<ref name="Gibbard1973" /> which had been previously conjectured by [[Michael Dummett]] and [[Robin Farquharson]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rudolf Farra and Maurice Salles|title=An Interview with Michael Dummett: From analytical philosophy to voting analysis and beyond|journal=Social Choice and Welfare|volume=27|issue=2|date=October 2006|doi=10.1007/s00355-006-0128-9|pages=347–364|s2cid=46164353|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/552/1/VPP05_01.pdf}}</ref>

==Life and career==
Allan Fletcher Gibbard was born on April 7, 1942, in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].<ref name="intlwhoswho">{{Cite book|title=The International Who's Who 2011|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2010|isbn=978-1-85743-546-7|edition=74th|page=[[iarchive:internationalwho0000unse m9p8/page/726/mode/1up|726]]|issn=0074-9613|oclc=502032895}}</ref> He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[mathematics]] from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1963 with minors in [[physics]] and [[philosophy]]. After teaching [[mathematics]] and physics in [[Ghana]] with the [[Peace Corps]] (1963–1965), Gibbard studied philosophy at [[Harvard University]], participating in the seminar on [[social philosophy|social]] and [[political philosophy]] with [[John Rawls]], [[Kenneth J. Arrow]], [[Amartya K. Sen]], and [[Robert Nozick]]. In 1971 Gibbard earned his [[PhD]], writing a dissertation under the direction of [[John Rawls]].

He served as professor of philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]] (1969–1974), and the [[University of Pittsburgh]] (1974–1977), before joining the [[University of Michigan]] where he spent the remainder of his career until his retirement in 2016. Gibbard chaired the University of Michigan's philosophy department (1987–1988) and has held the title of Richard B. Brandt Distinguished University Professor of Philosophy since 1994.

Gibbard was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1990 and was elected a Fellow of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2009,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=04282009 | title=72 New Members Chosen by Academy}}</ref> one of only two living philosophers to be so honored (the other being [[Brian Skyrms]]),.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://socialscience.ucdavis.edu/events/2015-iss-conference/conference-presenters-1/brian-skyrms-uc-irvine | title=Brian Skyrms, UC Irvine — Institute for Social Sciences}}</ref>  He is also a Fellow of the [[Econometric Society]], and has received Fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]. He served as President of the Central Division of the [[American Philosophical Association]] from 2001 to 2002.  He gave the [[Tanner Lectures]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://tannerlectures.berkeley.edu/2005-2006/ | title=2005-2006 Lecture Series &#124; Tanner Lectures}}</ref>

==Philosophical work==
=== Social choice theory ===
{{See also|Social choice theory}}
Soon after his doctoral degree, Gibbard provided a first proof of a [[conjecture]] that [[strategic voting]] was an intrinsic feature of [[Arrow impossibility theorem|non-dictatorial]] voting systems with at least three choices, a conjecture of [[Michael Dummett]] and [[Robin Farquharson]]. This work would eventually become known as "[[Gibbard's theorem]]", published in 1973.<ref name="Gibbard1973" /> [[Mark Satterthwaite]] later worked on a similar theorem which he published in 1975.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Mark A. |last=Satterthwaite |title=Strategy-proofness and Arrow's Conditions: Existence and Correspondence Theorems for Voting Procedures and Social Welfare Functions |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=10 |year=1975 |issue=2 |pages=187–217 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(75)90050-2 |citeseerx=10.1.1.471.9842 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Dummett |author-link=Michael Dummett |title=Voting Procedures |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-19-876188-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOFRAQAAIAAJ }}</ref> Satterthwaite and Jean Marie Brin published a paper in 1978 describing Gibbard's and Satterthwaite's mathematical proofs as the "[[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]]" and described its relationship to [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Blin|first1=Jean Marie|last2=Satterthwaite|first2=Mark A.|date=1978-10-31|title=Individual decisions and group decisions.

==== Gibbard's theorem ====
{{main|Gibbard's theorem}}
In the fields of [[mechanism design]] and [[social choice theory]], "Gibbard's theorem" is a result proven by Gibbard in 1973.<ref name="Gibbard1973">{{cite journal|last=Gibbard|first=Allan|author-link=Allan Gibbard|year=1973|title=Manipulation of voting schemes: A general result|url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall11/papers/Gibbard73.pdf|journal=Econometrica|volume=41|issue=4|pages=587–601|doi=10.2307/1914083|jstor=1914083}}</ref> It states that for any deterministic process of collective decision, at least one of the following three properties must hold:
# The process is [[Dictatorship mechanism|dictatorial]], i.e. there exists a distinguished agent who can impose the outcome;
# The process limits the possible outcomes to two options only;
# The process is open to [[Tactical voting|strategic voting]]: once an agent has identified their preferences, it is possible that they have no action at their disposal that best defends these preferences irrespective of the other agents' actions.

A corollary of this theorem is [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]] about voting rules. The main difference between the two is that Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem is limited to [[Ranked voting|ranked (ordinal) voting rules]]: a voter's action consists in giving a preference ranking over the available options. Gibbard's theorem is more general and considers processes of collective decision that may not be ordinal: for example, voting systems where voters assign grades to candidates ([[cardinal voting]]).  Gibbard's theorem can be proven using [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]].

Gibbard's theorem is itself generalized by [[Gibbard's 1978 theorem]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gibbard|first=Allan|date=1978|title=Straightforwardness of Game Forms with Lotteries as Outcomes|url=https://cms.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/math/papers/203.pdf|journal=Econometrica|volume=46|issue=3|pages=595–614|doi=10.2307/1914235|jstor=1914235|hdl=10419/220562 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and [[Hylland's theorem]], which extend these results to non-deterministic processes, i.e. where the outcome may not only depend on the agents' actions but may also involve an element of chance. The Gibbard's theorem assumes the collective decision results in exactly one winner and does not apply to [[Multiwinner voting|multi-winner voting]].

==== Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem ====
{{main|Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem}}
In [[social choice theory]], the '''Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem''' is a result published independently by Gibbard in 1973<ref name="gibbard">{{cite journal

}}</ref> It deals with deterministic [[Ranked voting|ordinal electoral system]]s that choose a single winner. It states that for every voting rule, one of the following three things must hold:

# The rule is dictatorial, i.e. there exists a distinguished voter who can choose the winner; or
# The rule limits the possible outcomes to two alternatives only; or
# The rule is susceptible to [[tactical voting]]: in certain conditions, a voter's sincere ballot may not best defend their opinion.

While the scope of this theorem is limited to ordinal voting, [[Gibbard's theorem]] is more general, in that it deals with processes of collective decision that may not be ordinal: for example, voting systems where voters assign grades to candidates. [[Gibbard's 1978 theorem]] and [[Hylland's theorem]] are even more general and extend these results to non-deterministic processes, i.e. where the outcome may not only depend on the voters' actions but may also involve a part of chance.

=== Ethical theory ===
{{See also|Ethical theory}}
Gibbard is best known in philosophy for his contributions to [[ethical theory]].  He is the author of three books in this area.  ''Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgment'' (1990) develops a general [[theory]] of moral [[judgment]] and judgments of [[rationality]]. Gibbard argues that when we endorse someone's [[Action (philosophy)|action]], [[belief]], or feeling as "[[rational]]" or warranted we are expressing acceptance of a system of norms that permits it. More narrowly, [[morality]] is about norms relating to the aptness of moral feelings (such as guilt and resentment).<ref>Allan Gibbard (1990). ''Wise Choices, Apt Feelings''.

Gibbard's second book, ''Thinking How to Live'' (2003), offers an argument for reconfiguring the distinctions between [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and [[descriptive]] [[discourse]], with implications as to the "long-standing debate"[https://books.google.com/books?id=GdQmEQ4YdIwC] over "objectivity" in ethics and [[Fact–value distinction|"factuality" in ethics]].<ref>Allan Gibbard (2003).

Gibbard's third book, ''Reconciling Our Aims: In Search of Bases for Ethics'' (2008), from the [[Tanner Lectures]], argues in favour of a broadly [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to [[ethics]].<ref>Allen Gibbard (2008).
