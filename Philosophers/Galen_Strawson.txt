He holds a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|chair]] in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Texas, Austin]], and taught for many years before that at the [[University of Reading]], [[City University of New York]], and [[Oxford University]].

==Education and career==
Strawson, the elder son of Oxford philosopher [[P. F. Strawson]], was educated at the [[Dragon School]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1959–65), where he won a scholarship to [[Winchester College]] (1965–68). He left school at 16, after completing his [[A-levels]] and winning a place at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]]. At Cambridge, he read Oriental Studies (1969–71), Social and Political Science (1971–72), and Moral Sciences (1972–73) before moving to the University of Oxford, where he received his BPhil in philosophy in 1977 and his DPhil in philosophy in 1983. He also spent a year as an ''auditeur libre'' ([[audit student]]) at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris and at the [[Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne]] as a French Government Scholar (1977–78).

Strawson taught at the University of Oxford from 1979 to 2000, first as a Stipendiary Lecturer at several different colleges, and then, from 1987 on, as [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] and Tutor of [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. In 1993, he was a Visiting Research Fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences, Canberra. He has also taught as a visiting professor at [[NYU]] (1997), [[Rutgers University]] (2000), the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (2010) and the [[Ecole des hautes études en sciences sociales]], Paris (2012). In 2011 he was an Old Dominion Fellow, Council of the Humanities, [[Princeton University]] (2011). In 2000, he moved to the [[University of Reading]] as professor of philosophy, and was also Distinguished Professor of Philosophy from 2004 to 2007 at the [[City University of New York]] Graduate Center.

==Philosophical work==

===Free will===
In the [[free will]] debate, Strawson holds that there is a fundamental sense in which free will is impossible, whether [[determinism]] is true or not. He argues for this position with what he calls his "basic argument", which aims to show that no-one is ever ultimately morally responsible for their actions, and hence that no one has free will in the sense that usually concerns us. In its simplest form, the basic argument runs thus:

# You do what you do, in any given situation, because of the way you are.
# To be ultimately responsible for what you do, you have to be ultimately responsible for the way you are—at least in certain crucial mental respects.
# But you cannot be ultimately responsible for the way you are in any respect at all.
# So you cannot be ultimately responsible for what you do.<ref>Strawson, Galen. "[http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 Free Will] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=25 August 2007 }}" in the [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], ed. Edward Craig (1998); "The Bounds of Freedom" in ''The Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', ed. Robert Kane (2002).</ref>

This argument resembles [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s position in ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', summarised by E. F. J. Payne as the "law of motivation, which states that a definite course of action inevitably ensues on a given character and motive".<ref>E. F. J. Payne, in his Translator's Introduction to Schopenhauer's ''The World as Will and Representation''</ref>

===Panpsychism===
{{further|Panpsychism|Realistic physicalism}}
Strawson has argued that what he calls "[[realistic physicalism]]" (or "realistic monism") [[logical consequence|entails]] panpsychism.<ref name="realistic-monism">Strawson, G. (2006) "Realistic Monism: Why Physicalism Entails Panpsychism", ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'', Volume 13, Nos. 10–11, Exeter, Imprint Academic pp. 3–31</ref> He writes that "as a real physicalist, then, I hold that the mental/experiential is physical."<ref name="realistic-monism"/>{{rp|7}} He quotes the physicist [[Arthur Eddington]] in support of his position as follows: "If we must embed our schedule of indicator readings in some kind of background, at least let us accept the only hint we have received as to the significance of the background—namely that it has a nature capable of manifesting itself as a mental activity.<ref name="realistic-monism"/>{{rp|11}} The editor of the ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]'', Anthony Freeman, has written that panpsychism is regarded by many as either "plain crazy, or else a direct route back to animism and superstition".<ref name="realistic-monism"/>{{rp|1}} But it has a long tradition in Western thought.<ref>Skrbina, D. (2005), ''Panpsychism in the West'', Cambridge, MA, MIT Press.</ref>
