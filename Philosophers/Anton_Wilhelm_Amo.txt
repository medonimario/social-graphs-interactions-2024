'''Anton Wilhelm Amo''' or '''Anthony William Amo''' (c. 1703 – c. 1759) was a [[Nzema people|Nzema]] philosopher from [[Axim]], [[Dutch Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]). Amo was a professor at the universities of [[University of Halle|Halle]] and [[University of Jena|Jena]] in [[Germany]] after studying there. He was brought to Germany by the [[Dutch West India Company]] in 1707 and was presented as a gift to Dukes [[Augustus William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Augustus William]] and [[Louis Rudolph, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Ludwig Rudolf]] of [[Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Loutzenhiser|first1=Mike|title=The role of the indigenous African psyche in the evolution of human consciousness|date=17 September 2008|publisher=iUniverse |location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=978-0595503766 |page=xiii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q83RJ_qBwUcC&pg=PR12}}</ref> being treated as a member of the family by their father [[Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:Plaque for Anton Wilhelm Amo in Jenergasse in Jena - 20180713 184118.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque for Anton Wilhelm Amo at Jenergasse 9, Jena. Photo 2018.]]
Amo was a [[Nzema people|Nzema]] (an [[Akan (ethnic group)|Akan]] people). He was born in [[Axim]] in the Western region of present-day Ghana, but at the age of about four he was moved to Amsterdam by the [[Dutch West India Company]]. Some accounts say that he was enslaved, others that he was sent to Amsterdam by a preacher working in Ghana. Ultimately, it is unknown.      

On 29 July 1708, Amo was [[baptism|baptised]] (and in 1721 [[confirmation|confirmed]]) in the palace's chapel of Salzdahlum near Wolfenbüttel. In 1721 and 1725 he is mentioned as a servant to the Duke's family.

He went on to the [[University of Halle]], whose Law School he entered in 1727. He finished his preliminary studies within two years, titling his thesis ''Dissertatio Inauguralis de Jure Maurorum in Europa'' (1729).<ref name="mad">{{cite web |first=Scott W.|last= Williams |title=ANTON-WILHELM AMO, African Professor in 18th century Germany |url=http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/special/amo-anton.html |website=Mathemathicians of the African Diaspora |publisher=Mathematics Department of [[State University of New York at Buffalo]] |access-date=15 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050509030254/http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/special/amo-anton.html |archive-date=9 May 2005 |date=2005 |url-status=live}}</ref> This manuscript on ''The Rights of Moors in Europe'' is lost, but a summary was published in his university's ''Annals'' (1730). For his further studies Amo moved to the [[University of Wittenberg]], studying [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[physiology]], [[astronomy]], history, law, theology, politics, and medicine, and mastered six languages (English, French, Dutch, Latin, Greek, and German). His medical education in particular was to play a central role in much of his later philosophical thought.

He gained his [[Doctorate#Germany|doctorate]] in philosophy at Wittenberg in 1734; his thesis (published as ''On the Absence of Sensation in the Human Mind and its Presence in our Organic and Living Body'') argued in favour of a broadly [[Mind–body dualism|dualist]] account of the person.  Specifically, he argues that it is correct to talk of a [[mind]] and a [[Body (biology)|body]], but that it is the [[Human body|body]] rather than the mind that perceives and feels.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lewis|first=Dwight|date=8 February 2018|title=Anton Wilhelm Amo: The African Philosopher in 18th Europe|url=https://blog.apaonline.org/2018/02/08/anton-wilhelm-amo-the-african-philosopher-in-18th-europe/|access-date=4 June 2021|website=Blog of the APA|language=en-US}}</ref> One example of an argument that Amo uses to show that it is the body, and not the mind, which senses goes as follows: 

<blockquote>Whatever feels, lives; whatever lives, depends on nourishment; whatever lives and depends on nourishment grows; whatever is of this nature is in the end resolved into its basic principles; whatever comes to be resolved into its basic principles is a complex; every complex has its constituent parts; whatever this is true of is a divisible body.  If therefore the human mind feels, it follows that it is a divisible body.</blockquote>
::::(''On the Ἀπάθεια ([[Apatheia]]) of the Human Mind'' 2.1)

Because (on Amo's account) the human mind is by definition immaterial and not a divisible body (''On the Ἀπάθεια (Apatheia) of the Human Mind'' 1.3), it therefore cannot be the case that the mind itself senses.

==Philosophical career and later life==
Amo returned to the [[University of Halle]] to lecture in philosophy under his preferred name of '''Antonius Guilielmus Amo Afer'''. In 1736 he was made a professor.<ref name="mad" />  From his lectures, he produced his second major work in 1738, ''Treatise on the Art of Philosophising Soberly and Accurately'',<ref name="mad" /> in which he developed an [[empiricism|empiricist]] epistemology very close to but distinct from that of philosophers such as [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]].  In it he also examined and criticised faults such as intellectual dishonesty, dogmatism, and prejudice.

In 1740, Amo took up a post in philosophy at the [[University of Jena]], but while there he experienced a number of changes for the worse.  The [[Ferdinand Albert II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] had died in 1735, leaving him without his long-standing patron and protector.<ref name="mad" />  That coincided with social changes in Germany, which was becoming intellectually and morally narrower and less liberal.  Those who argued against the secularisation of education (and against the rights of Africans in Europe) were regaining their ascendancy over those who campaigned for greater academic and social freedom, such as [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]].

Amo was subjected to an unpleasant campaign by some of his enemies, including a public [[Parody|lampoon]] staged at a theatre in Halle. He finally decided to return to the land of his birth.  He set sail on a [[Dutch West India Company]] ship to Ghana via [[Guinea]], arriving in about 1747; his  father and a sister were still living there. His life from then on becomes more obscure.  According to at least one report, he was taken to a Dutch fortress, [[Fort San Sebastian]] in [[Shama, Ghana|Shama]], in the 1750s, possibly to prevent him sowing dissent amongst the people.  The exact date, place, and manner of his death are unknown, though he probably died in about 1759 at the fort in Shama in Ghana.

==Honors==
On 10 October 2020, [[Google]] celebrated him with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://doodles.google/doodle/celebrating-anton-wilhelm-amo/ |title=Celebrating Anton Wilhelm Amo |website=Google |date=10 October 2020 }}: "On this day in 1730, Amo received the equivalent of a doctorate in philosophy from Germany’s University of Wittenberg."</ref>

In [[Stuttgart]], an Anton Wilhelm Amo Square in front of the [[Stuttgart Labour Court]] was decided in 2022.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |access-date=2023-01-14 |author=Stuttgarter Zeitung, Stuttgart Germany |language=en |title=Signal against racism: Stuttgart now names a square after Anton Wilhelm Amo after all |url=https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.signal-gegen-rassismus-stuttgart-benennt-nun-doch-einen-platz-nach-anton-wilhelm-amo.b03e1cc2-5ee3-444e-8977-eb002da3e55c.html}}</ref>
At the end of January 2023, the square formerly known as "Lerchenplätzle" in front of the [[Stuttgart Labour Court]] in Johannesstraße was renamed "Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Platz".<ref name=":0" />
In August 2020, in a context of "decolonization" of place names perceived to have racist origins, officials in the German capital [[Berlin]] proposed renaming [[Mohrenstraße]] to "Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Straße" in his honor.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rbb24.de/politik/beitrag/2020/08/berlin-mohrenstrasse-umbennenung-gruene-spd-amo.html|title=Mohrenstraße wird in Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Straße umbenannt|date=21 August 2020|work=[[Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg|RBB]]|access-date=21 August 2020|first=M. |last=Ernst |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210611235707/https://www.rbb24.de/politik/beitrag/2020/08/berlin-mohrenstrasse-umbennenung-gruene-spd-amo.html |archive-date=11 June 2021 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
