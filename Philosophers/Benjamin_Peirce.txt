'''Benjamin Peirce''' {{postnominals|ForMemRS|HonFRSE|country=GBR}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɜr|s}};<ref>"Peirce", in the case of Benjamin Peirce and family, always rhymes with "terse" and so, in most dialects, is pronounced like the word "{{Audio|en-us-purse.ogg|purse}}".

He made contributions to [[celestial mechanics]], [[statistics]], [[number theory]], [[algebra]], and the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], the son of first cousins [[Benjamin Peirce (librarian)|Benjamin Peirce]] (1778–1831), later librarian of Harvard, and Lydia Ropes Nichols Peirce (1781–1868).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rossiter Johnson|author2=John Howard Brown|title=The twentieth century biographical dictionary of notable Americans ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ve0UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT269|access-date=28 August 2011|year=1904|publisher=The Biographical Society|pages=269–}}</ref>

After graduating from [[Harvard University]] in 1829, he taught mathematics for two years at the [[Round Hill School]] in Northampton, and in 1831 was appointed professor of mathematics at Harvard. He added [[astronomy]] to his portfolio in 1842, and remained as Harvard professor until his death. In addition, he was instrumental in the development of Harvard's science curriculum, served as the college librarian, and was director of the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey]] from 1867 to 1874.
In 1842, he was elected as a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=1842&year-max=1842&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-04-12|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref> He was elected a [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society]] of London in 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=1&dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27peirce%27%29|title= Fellow Details|publisher= [[Royal Society]]|access-date= 27 May 2017|archive-date= July 8, 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190708073537/https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini|url-status= dead}}</ref>

==Research==
Benjamin Peirce is often regarded as the earliest American scientist whose research was recognized as world class.<ref>{{cite journal

===Mathematics===
In number theory, he proved there is no odd [[perfect number]] with fewer than four [[prime factor]]s.

In algebra, he was notable for the study of [[associative algebra]]s. He first introduced the terms [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent]] and [[nilpotent]] in 1870 to describe elements of these algebras, and he also introduced the [[Peirce decomposition]].

In the philosophy of mathematics, he became known for the statement that "Mathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions".<ref>First line of ''Linear Associative Algebra''</ref> Peirce's definition of mathematics was credited by his son, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], as helping to initiate the consequence-oriented philosophy of [[pragmatism]].  Like [[George Boole]], Peirce believed that mathematics could be used to study [[logic]]. These ideas were further developed by his son Charles, who noted that logic also includes the study of faulty reasoning.  In contrast, the later [[Logicism|logicist]] program of [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to base mathematics on logic.

===Statistics===
Peirce proposed what came to be known as [[Peirce's criterion|Peirce's Criterion]] for the statistical treatment of [[outlier]]s, that is, of apparently extreme observations. His ideas were further developed by his son Charles.<ref>Peirce, Charles Sanders (1870/1871/1873).</ref>

Peirce was an [[expert witness]] in the [[Howland will forgery trial]], where he was assisted by his son Charles. Their analysis of the questioned signature showed that it resembled another particular handwriting example so closely that the chance of such a match occurring at random, i.e. by pure coincidence, was extremely small.<ref>{{cite journal

He was devoutly religious, though he seldom published his theological thoughts.<ref name=IEP>Grattan-Guinness, Ivor and Walsh, Alison (2008), "Benjamin Peirce", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.
