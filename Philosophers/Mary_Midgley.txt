'''Mary Beatrice Midgley''' (''{{nee}}'' '''Scrutton'''; 13 September 1919 – 10 October 2018)<ref name="nytobit" /> was a British [[philosopher]]. A senior lecturer in [[philosophy]] at [[Newcastle University]], she was known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. She wrote her first book, ''Beast and Man'' (1978), when she was in her late fifties, and went on to write over 15 more, including ''Animals and Why They Matter'' (1983), ''Wickedness'' (1984), ''The Ethical Primate'' (1994), ''Evolution as a Religion'' (1985), and ''Science as Salvation'' (1992). She was awarded honorary [[doctorate]]s by [[Durham University|Durham]] and Newcastle universities. Her autobiography, ''The Owl of Minerva'', was published in 2005.

Midgley strongly opposed [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and argued against any attempt to make science a substitute for the [[humanities]]. She wrote extensively about what she thought philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. Midgley insisted that humans ought to be understood as first and foremost, a kind of animal. Several of her books and articles discussed philosophical ideas appearing in [[popular science]], including those of [[Richard Dawkins]]. She also wrote in favour of a moral interpretation of the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. ''The Guardian'' described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's "foremost scourge of 'scientific [[pretension]]'".<ref name=brown2001>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Midgley was born in London to Lesley and Tom Scrutton.<ref name="nytobit" /> Her father, the son of the eminent judge Sir [[Thomas Edward Scrutton]], was a [[curate]] in Dulwich and later chaplain of [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge|King's College, Cambridge]]. She was raised in Cambridge, Greenford and Ealing, and educated at [[Downe House School]] in [[Cold Ash, Berkshire]], where she developed her interest in classics and philosophy:

[[File:KingsCollegeChapelWest.jpg|thumb|left|Midgley's father was a [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] chaplain.]]
<blockquote>[A] new and vigorous Classics teacher offered to teach a few of us [[Classical Greek|Greek]], and that too was somehow slotted into our timetables. We loved this and worked madly at it, which meant that with considerable efforts on all sides, it was just possible for us to go to college on Classics … I had decided to read Classics rather than English – which was the first choice that occurred to me – because my English teacher, bless her, pointed out that English literature is something that you read in any case, so it is better to study something that you otherwise wouldn't. Someone also told me that, if you did Classics at Oxford, you could do Philosophy as well. I knew very little about this but, as I had just found Plato, I couldn't resist trying it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The Owl of Minerva|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-36788-3|page=62}}</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Somerville College.jpg|thumb|Midgley studied [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] at Oxford, going up to [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville]] in 1938.]]
Midgley took the Oxford entrance exam in the autumn of 1937, gaining a place at [[Somerville College]]. During the year before starting university, it was arranged that she would live in [[Austria]] for three months to learn [[German language|German]], but she had to leave after a month because of the [[Anschluss|worsening political situation]]. At Somerville she studied [[Literae Humaniores|Mods and Greats]] alongside [[Iris Murdoch]], graduating with a first-class honours degree.

Several of her lasting friendships that began at Oxford were with scientists, and she credited them with having educated her in a number of scientific disciplines.<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The Owl of Minerva|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-36788-3|pages=93–94}}</ref> After a split in the Labour club at Oxford over the Soviet Union's actions, she was on the committee of the newly formed Democratic Socialist Club alongside [[Tony Crosland]] and [[Roy Jenkins]].

During Midgley's time at Oxford, many of the young male undergraduates left to fight in the [[Second World War]]. This left the women undergraduates in an unlikely positions: for the first time they made up the majority in the student body. Recalling this time, Midgley writes "I think myself that this experience has something to do with the fact that [[Elizabeth Anscombe|Elizabeth]] [Anscombe] and I and [[Iris Murdoch|Iris]] [Murdoch] and [[Philippa Foot]] and [[Mary Warnock]] have all made our names in philosophy... I do think that in normal times a lot of good female thinking is wasted because it simply doesn't get heard."<ref>{{cite book |last=Midgley |first=Mary |title=The Owl of Minerva |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |isbn=0-415-36788-3 |page=123}}</ref> Interest in the philosophy of the women philosophers at this time sparked the interest of two philosophers at [[Durham University]], who began a project called ''In Parenthesis]'' <ref>[https://www.womeninparenthesis.co.uk/ In Parenthesis]</ref> which explores the connections between four women philosophers ([[Philippa Foot|Foot]], [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Anscombe]], Midgley and Murdoch).

==Career==

Midgley left Oxford in 1942 and went into the [[civil service]], as "the war put graduate work right out of the question". Instead, she "spent the rest of the war doing various kinds of work that were held to be of national importance".<ref name="notdoc">{{cite web|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Proud not to be a doctor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/oct/03/highereducation.uk2|work=The Guardian|date=3 October 2005|access-date=24 March 2014}}</ref> During this time she was also a teacher at Downe School and [[Bedford School]]. She returned to Oxford in 1947 to do graduate work with [[Gilbert Murray]]. She began research on [[Plotinus]]'s view of the soul, which she has described as "so unfashionable and so vast that I never finished my thesis".<ref name="notdoc" /> In retrospect Midgley has written of her belief that she is "lucky" to have missed out on having a [[doctorate]]. She argues that one of the main flaws in doctoral training is that, while it "shows you how to deal with difficult arguments", it does not "help you to grasp the big questions that provide its context – the background issues out of which the small problems arose."<ref name="notdoc" />

In 1949 Midgley went to [[Reading University]], teaching in the philosophy department there for four terms. In 1950 she married [[G.C.J. Midgley|Geoffrey Midgley]] (died 1997),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-geoffrey-midgley-1260317.html|title=Obituary: Geoffrey Midgley|website=[[Independent.co.uk]] |date=7 May 1997 }}</ref> also a philosopher. They moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], where he got a job in the philosophy department of [[Newcastle University]].<ref name="observer2014" /> Midgley stopped teaching for several years while she had three sons (Tom, David and Martin),<ref name="brown2001" /> before also getting a job in the philosophy department at Newcastle, where she and her husband were both "much loved".<ref name="observer2014" /> Midgley taught there between 1962 and 1980.<ref name="fellow">{{cite web|title=Honorary Fellow – Mary Midgley|url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/peals/people/honorary/midgley.htm|access-date=24 March 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324155647/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/peals/people/honorary/midgley.htm|archive-date=24 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> During her time at Newcastle, she began studying [[ethology]] and this led to her first book, ''Beast and Man'' (1978), published when she was 59. "I wrote no books until I was a good 50, and I'm jolly glad because I didn't know what I thought before then."<ref name="brown2001" />

==Awards==
Midgley was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Letters|D.Litt.]] by [[Durham University]] in 1995<ref>{{cite web|title=Honorary Degrees – Durham University|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/university.calendar/volumei/honorary_degrees/|access-date=27 March 2014}}</ref> and an honorary [[Doctor of Civil Law]] by [[Newcastle University]] in 2008.<ref name=fellow /> She was an honorary fellow of the Policy, Ethics and Life Sciences Research Centre at Newcastle University.<ref name=fellow /> In 2011 she was the first winner of the [[Philosophy Now]] Award for Contributions in the Fight Against Stupidity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philosophy Now Award|url=https://philosophynow.org/award|access-date=2 January 2019}}</ref>

==Death==
Midgley died at the age of 99 in [[Jesmond]] on 10 October 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/obituaries/mary-midgley-dead.html|title=Mary Midgley, 99, Moral Philosopher for the General Reader, Is Dead|newspaper=The New York Times |date=15 October 2018 |last1=Motyka |first1=John }}</ref><ref name="guardianobit">{{cite news|last1=Heal|first1=Jane|title=Mary Midgley obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/12/mary-midgley-obituary|work=The Guardian|date=12 October 2018}}</ref>

==Ideas and arguments==

===The purpose of philosophy ===
Midgley argued that philosophy is like [[plumbing]], something that nobody notices until it goes wrong. "Then suddenly we become aware of some bad smells, and we have to take up the floorboards and look at the concepts of even the most ordinary piece of thinking. The great philosophers ... noticed how badly things were going wrong, and made suggestions about how they could be dealt with."<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Else | first=Liz | date=3 November 2001 | title=Mary, Mary quite contrary | magazine=[[New Scientist]] | issn=0262-4079 | publisher=Reed Elsevier | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17223154-800-mary-mary-quite-contrary/ | access-date=11 January 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330082236/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17223154-800-mary-mary-quite-contrary/ | archive-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>  Midgley argued that philosophy was not something that was reserved for intellectuals and academics. In her view, it is something we ''all'' do — an activity that is part of the human conditions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}}

=== Philosophy and religion ===
Despite her upbringing, she did not embrace Christianity herself, because, she says, "I couldn't make it work. I would try to pray and it didn't seem to get me anywhere so I stopped after a while. But I think it's a perfectly sensible world view."<ref name="observer2014" /> She also argues that the world's religions should not simply be ignored: "It turns out that the evils which have infested religion are not confined to it, but are ones that can accompany any successful human institution. Nor is it even clear that religion itself is something that the human race either can or should be cured of."<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The myths we live by|url=https://archive.org/details/mythsweliveby00midg|url-access=limited|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/mythsweliveby00midg/page/n50 40]|publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415309066 }}</ref>

Midgley's book ''Wickedness'' (1984) has been described as coming "closest to addressing a theological theme: the problem of evil."<ref name=erasmus>{{cite web|last=McEachran|first=Alan|title=Mary Midgley|url=http://ptolemy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/MaryMidgley.pdf|work=Erasmus Darwin Society|access-date=27 March 2014|date=May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327223917/http://ptolemy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/MaryMidgley.pdf|archive-date=27 March 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> But, Midgley argues that we need to understand the human capacity for wickedness, rather than blaming God for it. Midgley argues that evil arises from aspects of human nature, not from an external force. She further argues that evil is the absence of good, with good being described as the positive virtues such as generosity, courage and kindness. Therefore, evil is the absence of these characteristics, leading to selfishness, cowardice and similar. She therefore criticizes existentialism and other schools of thought which promote the 'Rational Will' as a free agent. She also criticizes the tendency to demonize those deemed 'wicked', by failing to acknowledge that they also display some measure of some of the virtues.<ref name=erasmus />

Midgley also expressed her interest in [[Paul Davies]]' ideas on the inherent improbability of the order found in the universe. She argued that "there's some sort of tendency towards the formation of order", including towards life and "perceptive life".<ref name=observer2014 /> The best way, she argued, of talking about this is using the concept of "a life force", although she acknowledged that this is "vague".<ref name=observer2014 /> She also argued that "gratitude" is an important part of the motivation for [[theism]]. "You go out on a day like this and you're really grateful. I don't know who to."<ref name=observer2014 />

This understanding also links with Midgley's argument that the concept of [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]] has "both a scientific and a religious aspect."<ref name=demosp21>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Gaia: The next big idea|year=2001|publisher=Demos publications|isbn=1-84180-075-9|page=21|url=http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830013608/http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|archive-date=30 August 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref> She argued that people find this hard to grasp because our views on both science and religion have been narrowed so much that the connections between them are now obscured.<ref name=demosp21 /> This is not, however, about belief in a personal God, but instead about responding to the system of life, as revealed by Gaia, with "wonder, awe and gratitude"<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Gaia: The next big idea|year=2001|publisher=Demos publications|isbn=1-84180-075-9|page=24|url=http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830013608/http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|archive-date=30 August 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

She observes that "practically all the great European philosophers have been bachelors", and argues that this may be responsible for the solipsism, skepticism, and individualism that dominate the tradition.{{Sfn|Mac Cumhaill|Wiseman|2022|p=ix}}

===Gaia and philosophy===
Midgley was supportive of [[James Lovelock]]'s [[Gaia hypothesis]]. This was part of her "principal passion" of "reviving our reverence for the earth".<ref name=fellow /> Midgley also described Gaia as a "breakthrough", as it was "the first time a theory derived from scientific measurements has carried with it an implicit moral imperative – the need to act in the interests of this living system on which we all depend.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wakeford|first=Tom|title=In a climate of change|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/in-a-climate-of-change/153581.article|access-date=28 March 2014|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=22 September 2000}}</ref>

In 2001 Midgley founded, along with David Midgley and Tom Wakeford, the Gaia Network, and became its first Chair.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite book|title=Earthly realism|year=2007|publisher=Societas|isbn=978-1845400804|page=vi|editor=Mary Midgley|chapter=Contributors}}</ref><ref name=network>{{cite web|title=About us – Gaia Network|url=http://www.gaiaweb.uk.net/GAIAWEB/Gaboutus.php|access-date=28 March 2014}}</ref> Their regular meetings on the implications of Gaia led to the 2007 book ''Earthy realism'' edited by Midgley, which sought to bring together the scientific and spiritual aspects of Gaia theory.<ref name=network />

Midgley's 2001 pamphlet for [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] ''Gaia: The next big idea'' argues for the importance of the idea of Gaia as a "powerful tool" in science, morality, psychology and politics, to gain a more holistic understanding of the world.<ref name=demosp11>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Gaia: The next big idea|year=2001|publisher=Demos publications|isbn=1-84180-075-9|page=11|url=http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830013608/http://www.demos.co.uk/catalogue/gaia/|archive-date=30 August 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Instead, Midgley argued that we "must learn how to value various aspects of our environment, how to structure social relationships and institutions so that we value social and spiritual life, as well as the natural world, alongside commercial and economic aspects.<ref name=demosp11 />

Her book ''Science and Poetry'', also published in 2001, also includes a discussion on the idea of Gaia, which she argued "is not a gratuitous, semi-mystical fantasy", but instead is "a useful idea, a cure for distortions that spoil our current world-view."<ref name=poetry172>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Science and poetry|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415378482|page=172}}</ref> It is useful both in finding practical solutions to environmental problems and also in giving us "a more realistic view of ourselves".<ref name=poetry172 /> Gaia has, Midgley argued, both scientific and moral importance, which also involves politics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Science and poetry|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415378482|page=198}}</ref> There is also a religious angle to Gaia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Science and poetry|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415378482|page=199}}</ref>

===Reductionism and materialism===
''Beast and Man'' was an examination of human nature and a reaction against the [[reductionism]] of [[sociobiology]], and the [[relativism]] and [[behaviorism]] she saw as prevalent in much of social science. She argued that human beings are more similar to animals than many social scientists then acknowledged, while animals are in many ways more sophisticated than was often accepted.<ref name=observer2014 /> She criticized [[existentialists]] who argued that there was no such thing as human nature and writers such as [[Desmond Morris]] who she understood as arguing that human nature was "brutal and nasty".<ref name=observer2014 /> Instead, she argued that human beings and their relationship with animals could be better understood by using the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] methods of [[ethology]] and [[comparative psychology]], and that this approach showed that "we do have a nature and it's much more in the middle."<ref name=observer2014 />

Writing in the 2002 introduction to the reprint of ''Evolution as a Religion'' (1985), Midgley reported that she wrote both this book, and the later ''Science as Salvation'' (1992) to counter the "quasi-scientific speculation"<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Evolution as a Religion|year=2002|page=ix|chapter=New Introduction}}</ref> of "certain remarkable [[Prophesy|prophetic]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] passages that appeared suddenly in scientific books, often in their last chapters."<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Evolution as a Religion|year=2002|page=iii|chapter=New Introduction}}</ref> ''Evolution as a Religion'' dealt with the theories of [[evolutionary biologists]], including [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]], while ''Science as Salvation'' dealt with the theories of physicists and [[artificial intelligence]] researchers. Midgley writes that she still believes that these theories, "have nothing to do with any reputable theory of evolution,"<ref name=intropx>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=Evolution as a Religion|year=2002|page=x|chapter=New Introduction}}</ref> and will not solve the real social and moral problems the world is facing, either through [[genetic engineering]] or the use of machines. She concludes: "These schemes still seem to me to be just displacement activities proposed in order to avoid facing our real difficulties."<ref name=intropx /> "[I]n exposing these rhetorical attempts to turn science into a comprehensive ideology," she wrote in ''The myths we live by'', "I am not attacking science but defending it against dangerous misconstructions."<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The myths we live by|url=https://archive.org/details/mythsweliveby00midg|url-access=limited|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/mythsweliveby00midg/page/n40 30]|publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415309066 }}</ref>

Midgley argued against reductionism, or the attempt to impose any one approach to understanding the world. She suggests that there are "many maps, many windows," arguing that "we need ''scientific pluralism''—the recognition that there are many independent forms and sources of knowledge—rather than reductivism, the conviction that one fundamental form underlies them all and settles everything." She writes that it is helpful to think of the world as "a huge aquarium. We cannot see it as a whole from above, so we peer in at it through a number of small windows ... We can eventually make quite a lot of sense of this habitat if we patiently put together the data from different angles.  But if we insist that our own window is the only one worth looking through, we shall not get very far."<ref>{{cite book|last=Midgley|first=Mary|title=The myths we live by|url=https://archive.org/details/mythsweliveby00midg|url-access=limited|year=2003|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mythsweliveby00midg/page/n36 26]–27|publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415309066 }}</ref>

She argued that, "acknowledging matter as somehow akin to and penetrated by mind is not adding a new ... assumption ... it is becoming aware of something we are doing already." She suggested that "this topic is essentially the one which caused [[Einstein]] often to remark that the really surprising thing about science is that it works at all ... the simple observation that the laws of thought turn out to be the laws of things."<ref>Midgley 1992, p. 14</ref>

Midgley wrote her 2014 book, ''Are you an illusion?'' as a response to [[Francis Crick]]'s argument in his book ''[[The Astonishing Hypothesis]]'' that a person's sense of personal identity and free will is no more than the behaviour of nerve cells. She attacks the understanding inherent in this argument that everything, including a sense of self, can be understood through its physical properties.<ref name=observer2014>{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Andrew|title=Mary Midgley: a late stand for a philosopher with soul|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/mary-midgley-philosopher-soul-human-consciousness|work=The Observer|access-date=24 March 2014|date=23 March 2014}}</ref> Instead, she argues that there are different levels of explanation, which need to be studied using different methods. This means that thoughts and memories are an integral part of reality for both humans and animals and need to be studied as such.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cave|first=Stephen|title=Review of Are you an illusion?|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/70476606-ae8e-11e3-aaa6-00144feab7de.html|work=Financial Times|access-date=24 March 2014|date=21 March 2014}}</ref>

===Midgley–Dawkins debate<!-- This section is linked from [[Richard Dawkins]] -->===
In 1978, [[J. L. Mackie]] published an article entitled ''The Law of the Jungle: Moral Alternatives and Principles of Evolution'', praising Dawkins's ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', and discussing how its ideas might be applied to moral philosophy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mackie |first1=J.L. |year=1978 |title=The Law of the Jungle: Moral Alternatives and Principles of Evolution |journal=Philosophy |volume=53 |issue=206 |pages=455–464 |doi=10.1017/S0031819100026322 |s2cid=159925034 |doi-access= }}</ref> Midgley responded in 1979 with "Gene-Juggling", arguing that ''The Selfish Gene'' was about [[psychological egoism]], rather than evolution.<ref name="Gene Juggling">{{cite journal |last1=Midgley |first1=M. |year=1979 |title=Gene-juggling |journal=Philosophy |volume=54 |issue= 210|pages=439–458 |doi=10.1017/S0031819100063488 |pmid=11661921 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In a 1981 rebuttal, Dawkins retorted that the comment was "hard to match, in reputable journals, for its patronising condescension toward a fellow academic".<ref name=dawkins81>{{cite journal |last1=Dawkins |first1=R. |year=1981 |title=In Defence of Selfish Genes |journal=Philosophy |volume=56 |issue= 218|pages=556–573 |doi=10.1017/S0031819100050580 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

The bad feeling between Dawkins and Midgley did not diminish. In a note to page 55 in the 2nd edition of ''The Selfish Gene'' (1989), Dawkins refers to her "highly intemperate and vicious paper". Midgley continued to oppose Dawkins' ideas. In her books ''Evolution as a Religion'' (2002) and ''The Myths We Live By'' (2003), she wrote about what she saw as his confused use of language — using terms such as "selfish" in different ways without alerting the reader to the change in meaning—and some of what she regarded as his [[rhetoric]] ("genes exert ultimate power over behaviour"), which she argued is more akin to religion than science. She wrote in a letter to ''The Guardian'' in 2005:

<blockquote>[There is] widespread discontent with the [[neo-Darwinist]]—or Dawkinsist—orthodoxy that claims something which Darwin himself denied, namely that natural selection is the sole and exclusive cause of evolution, making the world therefore, in some important sense, entirely random. This is itself a strange faith which ought not to be taken for granted as part of science.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/06/religion.news|title=Letters: Designs on Darwinism|date=5 September 2005|website=The Guardian}}</ref></blockquote>

In an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'' in September 2007, she argued that Dawkins' views on evolution are ideologically driven: "The ideology Dawkins is selling is the worship of competition. It is projecting a [[Thatcherite]] take on economics on to evolution. It's not an impartial scientific view; it's a political drama."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article2977701.ece|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022042536/http://independent.co.uk/incoming/article2977701.ece|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 October 2007|title=Jackson, 3 January 2008|website=[[Independent.co.uk]] }}</ref> In April 2009 Midgley reiterated her critical interpretation of ''The Selfish Gene'' as part of a series of articles on [[Hobbes]] in ''The Guardian''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/apr/20/religion-philosophy-hobbes-dawkins-selfishness|title=Mary Midgley: Selfishness: where Dawkins got it wrong|first=Mary|last=Midgley|date=20 April 2009|website=The Guardian}}</ref> In her 2010 book ''The Solitary Self: Darwin and the Selfish Gene'', she argues that "simple one-sided accounts of human motives, such as the "selfish gene" tendency in recent neo-Darwinian thought, may be illuminating but are always unrealistic".<ref>''The Solitary Self'', publisher's description</ref>

==Midgley in art==
Midgley is referred to in ''[[The Lives of Animals]]'' (1999), a work of fiction  by the South African novelist [[J. M. Coetzee]]. The book has been likened to a cross between a short story and a philosophical dialogue, as Coetzee's protagonist, Elizabeth Costello, often speaks at length about philosophical ideas. Many reviewers expressed bafflement at the text, which has an enigmatic and riddling style. As one reviewer noted, "the reader is not quite sure whether he is intended to spot some confusion or contradiction or non-sequitur in [the protagonist's] arguments."<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2003/11/20/disturbing-the-peace/ | title=Disturbing the Peace - a review of Elizabeth Costello by J.M. Coetzee | magazine=[[The New York Review of Books]] | date=November 20, 2003 | access-date=June 15, 2018 | author=Lodge, David| author-link = David Lodge (author)}}</ref> Other critics however have noted many affinities between ''The Lives of Animals'' and Midgley's philosophy, and have used Midgley's ideas to make sense of Coetzee's work.

The main character, who also appears in Coetzee's novel ''[[Elizabeth Costello]]'', is concerned with the moral status of animals, a subject Midgley addressed in ''Animals and Why They Matter'', and discusses at length the idea of sympathy as an ethical concept, a subject Midgley wrote about in ''Beast and Man''. Andy Lamey wrote that the result of these and other similarities is that Coetzee's work "evoke[s] a particular conception of ethics, one very similar to that of the philosopher Mary Midgley. Such a view affords a central role to sympathy and is fundamentally opposed to a long-standing rival view, most clearly exemplified by the social contract tradition, which prioritizes an instrumental conception of rationality."<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=1715344 Lamey 2010], p. 172; for similarities between Midley and Coetzee, see pp. 175–181</ref>

Coetzee and Midgley additionally shared a longstanding fascination with [[Robinson Crusoe]]. Coetzee retells the Crusoe story in his novel ''[[Foe (Coetzee novel)|Foe]]'', while Midgley wrote about Crusoe in her essay "Duties Concerning Islands." Midgley's essay argued for the idea that human beings can have ethical obligations to non-human entities such as animals and ecosystems, an idea also found in ''The Lives of Animals'', ''Foe'' and many other works by Coetzee.<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=1715344 Lamey 2010], p. 175</ref>

Midgley agreed to sit for sculptor [[Jon Edgar]] in Newcastle during 2006, as part of the [[Environment Triptych]], along with heads of [[Richard Mabey]] and [[James Lovelock]].<ref>Edgar 2008</ref> This was exhibited at [[Yorkshire Sculpture Park]] in 2013.<ref>''Jon Edgar - Sculpture Series Heads: Terracotta Portraits of Contributors to British Sculpture'' (2013) Scott, M., Hall, P., and Pheby, H. {{ISBN|978-0955867514}}</ref>
