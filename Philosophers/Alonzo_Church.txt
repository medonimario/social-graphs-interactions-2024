==Life==
Alonzo Church was born on June 14, 1903, in [[Washington, D.C.]], where his father, Samuel Robbins Church, was a [[justice of the peace]]<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bundy |first=Charles S. |date=1902 |title=A History of the Office of Justice of the Peace in the District of Columbia |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40066805 |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society, Washington, D.C. |volume=5 |pages=259–293 |jstor=40066805 |issn=0897-9049}}</ref> and the judge of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia. He was the grandson of Alonzo Webster Church (1829–1909), [[United States Senate Librarian]] from 1881 to 1901, and great-grandson of [[Alonzo Church (college president)|Alonzo Church]], a professor of Mathematics and Astronomy and 6th President of the University of Georgia.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Coulter |first=E. Merton |title=College Life in the Old South |publisher=University of Georgia Press |year=1928 |isbn= 9-780-8203-3199-7}}</ref> As a young boy, Church was partially blinded by an air gun accident.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://builds.openlogicproject.org/content/history/biographies/alonzo-church.pdf |title=Alonzo Church |date=2022-12-19 |website=Open Logic}}</ref> The family later moved to Virginia after his father lost his position at the university because of failing eyesight. With help from his uncle, also named Alonzo Church, the son attended the private Ridgefield School for Boys in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]].<ref>The Ridgefield School for Boys, also known as the Ridgefield School, was a private school that existed from 1907 to 1938. See [http://jackfsanders.tripod.com/rschool2.htm The Ridgefield School].</ref> After graduating from Ridgefield in 1920, Church attended Princeton University, where he was an exceptional student. He published his first paper on [[Lorentz transformation]]s<ref>{{cite journal | jstor=2298823 | last1=Church | first1=Alonzo | title=Uniqueness of the Lorentz Transformation | journal=The American Mathematical Monthly | year=1924 | volume=31 | issue=8 | pages=376–382 | doi=10.1080/00029890.1924.11986368 }}</ref> in 1924 and graduated the same year with a degree in mathematics. He stayed at Princeton for graduate work, earning a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics in three years under [[Oswald Veblen]].

He married Mary Julia Kuczinski in 1925. The couple had three children: Alonzo Jr. (1929), Mary Ann (1933), and Mildred (1938).

After receiving his Ph.D., he taught briefly as an instructor at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paw.princeton.edu/article/early-history-computing-princeton|title=An early history of computing at Princeton|date=2012-04-04|website=Princeton Alumni Weekly|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> He received a two-year [[United States National Research Council|National Research Fellowship]] that enabled him to attend [[Harvard University]] in 1927–1928, and the [[University of Göttingen]] and [[University of Amsterdam]] the following year.

He taught philosophy and mathematics at Princeton for nearly four decades, from 1929 to 1967. He held the Flint Professorship of Philosophy and Mathematics at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], 1967–1990.<ref name="life">{{Cite web |title=Alonzo Church: Life and Work |url=https://www.math.ucla.edu/~hbe/church.pdf |access-date=2022-04-14 |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901152639/https://www.math.ucla.edu/~hbe/church.pdf |archive-date=1 September 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He was a Plenary Speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1962 in Stockholm.<ref>{{cite book |last=Church |first=Alonzo |chapter-url=http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1962.1/Main/icm1962.1.0023.0058.ocr.pdf |chapter=Logic, arithmetic and automata |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228050922/http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1962.1/Main/icm1962.1.0023.0058.ocr.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-28 |title=Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians |pages=23–35 |year=1962 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Mathematical work==
Church is known for the following accomplishments:
* His proof that the [[Entscheidungsproblem]], which asks for a [[decision procedure]] to determine the truth of arbitrary propositions in a first-order mathematical [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]], is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]]. This is known as [[Church's theorem]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Church |author-link=Alonzo Church |title=An unsolvable problem of elementary number theory |journal=American Journal of Mathematics |volume=58 |number=2 |year=1936 |pages=345–363 |doi=10.2307/2371045 |jstor=2371045 }}</ref> 
* His invention of the [[lambda calculus]].
* His use of the lambda calculus to prove that [[Peano arithmetic]] is undecidable.<ref name="life"/>
* His articulation of what has come to be known as the Church–Turing thesis.
* Being a founding editor of the ''[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]'', editing its reviews section for 43 years from 1936 until 1979.
* His authorship of a prominent textbook in the field of mathematical logic, ''Introduction to Mathematical Logic''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Church | first=Alonzo | title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic | publisher=Princeton University Press | date=1996 | isbn=978-0-691-02906-1}}</ref>
* The [[Church–Rosser theorem]]

The lambda calculus emerged in his 1936 paper showing the unsolvability of the Entscheidungsproblem. This result preceded Alan Turing's work on the [[halting problem]], which also demonstrated the existence of a problem unsolvable by mechanical means. Upon hearing of Church's work, Turing enrolled at Princeton later that year under Church for a Ph.D.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Armstrong *14 |first=April C. |title=Alonzo Church |url=https://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd/tag/alonzo-church/ |access-date=2022-04-14 |website=Mudd Manuscript Library Blog |language=en-US}}</ref>  Church and Turing then showed that the lambda calculus and the [[Turing machine]] used in Turing's halting problem were equivalent in capabilities, and subsequently demonstrated a variety of alternative "mechanical processes for computation." This resulted in the Church–Turing thesis.

The efforts for automatically generating a controller implementation from specifications originates from his ideas.<ref>{{cite book | last=Lúcio | first=Levi | last2=Rahman | first2=Salman | last3=Cheng | first3=Chih-Hong | last4=Mavin | first4=Alistair | title=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | chapter=Just Formal Enough?

The lambda calculus influenced the design of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] and [[functional programming]] languages in general. The [[Church encoding]] is named in his honor.

In his honor the Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation was established in 2015 by the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group for Logic and Computation ([[ACM SIGLOG]]), the [[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]] (EATCS), the European Association for Computer Science Logic ([[EACSL]]), and the [[Kurt Gödel Society]] (KGS). The award is for an outstanding contribution to the field published within the past 25 years and must not yet have received recognition via another major award, such as the [[Turing Award]], the [[Paris Kanellakis Award]], or the [[Gödel Prize]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/church-award |title=Alonzo Church Award |website=eatcs.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://siglog.acm.org/alonzo-church-award-for-outstanding-contributions-to-logic-and-computation-2019/|title = Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation 2019 – ACM Special Interest Group on Logic and Computation |website=siglog.acm.org}}</ref>

Church also made contributions to the [[Algorithmically random sequence|theory of random sequences]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Church |first1=Alonzo |title=On the concept of a random sequence |journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |date=1940 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=130‒135 |url=https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-american-mathematical-society/volume-46/issue-2/On-the-concept-of-a-random-sequence/bams/1183502434.full}}</ref>

==Philosophical work==
{{Expand section|date=January 2023}}
{{Blockquote|Church’s elaboration of a methodology involving the logistic method, his philosophical criticisms of nominalism and his defense of realism, his argumentation leading to conclusions about the theory of meaning, and the detailed construction of the Fregean and [[Bertrand Russell|Russellian]] [[Modal logic|intensional logics]], are more than sufficient to place him high up among the most important philosophers of this century.|[[C. Anthony Anderson]], doctoral student of Church (1977)<ref>{{Harv|Anderson|1998}}</ref>}} Church is also known for the [[Frege–Church ontology]], which he created based on the philosophical ideas of [[Gottlob Frege]].

== Influence ==
Over the course of his academic career, Church oversaw 31 doctoral students.<ref name="life"/> Many of them have led distinguished careers in mathematics, computer science, and other academic subjects, including [[Peter B. Andrews]], [[George Alfred Barnard|George A. Barnard]], [[David Berlinski]], [[William Boone (mathematician)|William W. Boone]], [[Martin Davis (mathematician)|Martin Davis]], [[Alfred L. Foster]], [[Leon Henkin]], [[John George Kemeny|John G. Kemeny]], [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen C. Kleene]], [[Simon B. Kochen]], [[Maurice L'Abbé]], [[Gary R. Mar]], [[Michael O. Rabin]],  [[Nicholas Rescher]], [[Hartley Rogers, Jr.]], [[J. Barkley Rosser]], [[Dana Scott]], [[Raymond Smullyan]] and [[Alan Turing]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=8011 | title=Mathematics Genealogy Project | access-date=12 August 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100804125134/http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=8011| archive-date= 4 August 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In addition to those he directly supervised, Church also had a large influence on other mathematicians and computer scientists. [[Haskell Curry]], who expanded on Church's ideas with the concept of [[currying]], stated that one of his textbooks, Introduction to Mathematical Logic (first published in 1944), was "written with the meticulous precision which characterizes the author's work generally."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Church/|title=Alonzo Church - Biography|website=Maths History}}</ref>
