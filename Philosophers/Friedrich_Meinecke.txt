'''Friedrich Meinecke''' (October 20, 1862 – February 6, 1954) was a German historian with [[national liberal]] and [[antisemitism|antisemitic views]] who supported the Nazi [[invasion of Poland]]. As a representative of an older tradition he criticized the Nazi regime after World War II but continued to express antisemitic prejudices.<ref>''Germany: The Long Road West: Volume 2: 1933–1990'', Heinrich August Winkler: "But when it came to the Jews, Meinecke's thoughts reflected the same old anti-Semitic opinions"</ref><ref>''The anti-Enlightenment tradition'', Zeev Sternhell Yale University 2010 Press, page 383</ref>

In 1948, he helped to found the [[Free University of Berlin]] in [[West Berlin]], and remained an important figure to the end of his life.

==Life==
Meinecke was born in [[Salzwedel]] in the [[Province of Saxony]] in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and attended school at the [[Köllnisches Gymnasium|Köllnische Gymnasium]] in [[Berlin]]. He was educated at the [[University of Bonn]] and the [[University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin]]. In 1887–1901 he worked as an archivist at the German State Archives. A professor at the [[University of Strasbourg]], he served as editor of the journal {{lang|de|Historische Zeitschrift}} between 1896 and 1935 and chaired the {{lang|de|Historische Reichskommission}} from 1928 to 1935. As a nationalist historian, Meinecke had little regard for the wishes of peoples in Eastern Europe,<ref>''East European Quarterly'', Tom 1 page 269. University of Colorado, 1967</ref> and he went as far as writing about "raw bestiality of the south Slavs",<ref>''Friedrich Meinecke and German politics in the twentieth century'' – Page 20. Robert A. Pois</ref> while favoring [[Lebensraum|German expansionism into the East]].<ref>''The Lost German East: Forced Migration and the Politics of Memory, 1945–1970'', page 73</ref>

During the First World War he advocated removing Polish landowners from the Prussian provinces of [[West Prussia]] and [[Province of Posen|Posen]], which had been acquired from Poland during the [[Partitions of Poland]], to [[Congress Poland]]. In addition, he proposed the German colonization of [[Courland]] after the expulsion of its Latvian population.<ref>''Globalisation and the Nation in Imperial Germany'', Sebastian Conrad, page 175</ref> Some authors have likened his views to [[ethnic cleansing]].<ref>''Telos'' – Issues 94–97 – Page 159. State University of New York at Buffalo. Graduate Philosophy Association – 1994</ref> When the [[German Empire]] formulated the so-called [[Polish Border Strip]] plan, which called for the annexation of a large swathe of land from Congress Poland and the removal of millions of Poles and Jews to make room for German settlers, Meinecke welcomed the idea with contentment.<ref>''The German Empire, 1871–1918'', Hans-Ulrich Wehler page 112–113.</ref>

Meinecke was best known for his work on 18th- and 19th-century German intellectual and cultural history. The book that made his reputation was his 1908 work {{lang|de|Weltbürgertum und Nationalstaat}} ('Cosmopolitanism and the National State'), which traced the development of national feelings in the 19th century. Starting with {{lang|de|Die Idee der Staatsräson}} (1924), much of his work concerns the conflict between {{lang|de|Kratos}} (power) and {{lang|de|Ethos}} (morality) and how to achieve a balance between them.

One of his students was [[Heinrich Brüning]], the future Chancellor. Under the [[Weimar Republic]], Meinecke was a {{lang|de|Vernunftsrepublikaner}} (republican by reason), someone who supported the republic as the least bad alternative. In 1918 he had been one of the founders of the [[German Democratic Party]].

Under the [[Third Reich]], Meinecke had some sympathy for the regime, especially in regard to its early [[antisemitic]] laws. After 1935, Meinecke fell into a state of semi-disgrace, and was removed as editor of the {{lang|de|Historische Zeitschrift}}. Though Meinecke remained in public a supporter of the regime, he privately became increasingly bothered by what he regarded as the violence and crudeness of the Nazis. Nevertheless, he openly described himself as "anti-Semitic",<ref>''The bourgeois Democrats of Weimar Germany'', page 12
Robert A. Pois – 1976  "Friedrich Meinecke, in his Erinnerungen, confessed to being a "rugged anti-Semite"</ref> and while he was willing to have Jewish friends and colleagues, the Nazi persecution of Jews never bothered him much.<ref>''Militarism, Imperialism, and Racial Accommodation: An Analysis and Interpretation of the Early Writings of Robert E. Park'', by Stanford M. Lyman page 146  University of Arkansas Press</ref>

After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, he praised it in a letter to Siegfred August Kaehler: "You will also have been delighted by this splendid campaign".<ref>''The Quest for the Lost Nation: Writing History in Germany and Japan in the American Century'' (California World History Library) Sebastian Conrad page 48</ref>

In of Meinecke's best-known books, {{lang|de|Die Deutsche Katastrophe}} ('The German Catastrophe') of 1946, he attempted to reconcile his lifelong belief in authoritarian state power with the events of 1933–45. His explanation for the success of [[Nazism]] points to the legacy of Prussian militarism in Germany, the effects of rapid industrialisation and the weaknesses of the middle classes, but Meinecke also asserts that Hitlerism benefited from a series of unfortunate accidents, which had no connection with the earlier developments in German history. Meinecke interpreted Nazism as an "alien force occupying Germany",<ref>''Thinking about the Holocaust: After Half a Century'', Alvin H. Rosenfeld – 1997, page 169</ref> and he also expressed prejudice against Jews.<ref>''Germany: The Long Road West: Volume 2: 1933–1990'', Heinrich August Winkler "But when it came to the Jews, Meinecke's thoughts reflected the same old anti-Semitic prejudices"</ref> Meinecke claimed that Jews were responsible for antisemitism and blamed them for the fall of liberalism. The German catastrophe represented two classic themes of antisemitism: resentment based on Jewish economic activities and their alleged "character".<ref>''The anti-Enlightenment tradition'', Zeev Sternhell Yale University 2010 Press, page 383</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ó Dochartaigh |first1=Pól |title=Germans and Jews Since The Holocaust |date=2015 |publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education |isbn=978-1-137-57028-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8w0CwAAQBAJ |language=en |chapter=Jews and West Germany I (1949–1967) }}{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 1948, Meinecke helped to found the [[Free University of Berlin]].

British historian [[E. H. Carr]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Carr, E. H.|year=1961|title=What is History?|publisher=Macmillan/Penguin|isbn=0-14-020652-3}}</ref> cites him as an example of a historian whose views are heavily influenced by the {{lang|de|[[Zeitgeist]]}}: liberal during the German Empire, discouraged during the interwar period and deeply pessimistic after World War II.
