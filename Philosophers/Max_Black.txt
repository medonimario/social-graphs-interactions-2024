'''Max Black''' (February 24, 1909 – August 27, 1988) was an [[Azerbaijan]]-born British-American philosopher who was a leading figure in [[analytic philosophy]] in the years after [[World War II]]. He made contributions to the [[philosophy of language]], the [[philosophy of mathematics]] and [[philosophy of science|science]], and the [[philosophy of art]], also publishing studies of the work of philosophers such as [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]. His translation (with [[Peter Geach]]) of Frege's published philosophical writing is a classic text.

==Early life and education==
Black was born on February 24, 1909, in [[Baku]], in present-day [[Azerbaijan]]. He is of [[Jewish]] descent.<ref>''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', 2nd ed.</ref> In 1912, he moved with his family to [[London]], where he grew up. 

He studied mathematics at [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he developed an interest in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[G. E. Moore]], and [[Frank P. Ramsey]] were all at Cambridge at that time, and their influence on Black may have been considerable. He graduated in 1930, and was awarded a fellowship to study at [[Göttingen]] for a year.

==Career==
From 1931 to 1936, he was mathematics master at the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle]].

His first book was ''The Nature of Mathematics'' (1933), an exposition of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' and of current developments in the philosophy of mathematics.

Black made notable contributions to the metaphysics of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]. In his "The Identity of Indiscernibles", Black presents an objection to [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz' Law]] by means of a hypothetical scenario in which he conceives two distinct spheres having [[Similarity (philosophy)#Exact similarity and identity|exactly the same properties]], thereby contradicting Leibniz' second principle in his formulation of "The Identity of Indiscernibles". By virtue of there being two objects, albeit with identical properties, the existence of two objects, even in a void, denies their identicality.

He lectured in mathematics at the [[Institute of Education]] in London from 1936 to 1940. In 1940 he moved to the [[United States]] and joined the Philosophy Department at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]. In 1946, he accepted a professorship in philosophy at [[Cornell University]]. In 1948, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. Black advised the philosophy dissertation of American novelist [[William H. Gass]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |access-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref> 

==Death==
Black died in [[Ithaca, New York]] age 79. His younger brother was the architect [[Misha Black]].
