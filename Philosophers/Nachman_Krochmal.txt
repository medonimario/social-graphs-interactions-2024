'''Nachman HaKohen Krochmal''' ({{langx|he|נחמן קְרוֹכְמַל}}; born in [[Brody]], [[Austrian Galicia|Galicia]], on 17 February 1785; died at [[Ternopil]] on 31 July 1840) was a [[Jewish]] [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galician]] [[philosopher]], [[theology|theologian]], and [[historian]].

== Biography ==
[[Image:Krochmal More Nevuche.jpg|thumb|250px|Title page from '''Nachman Krochmal's''' ''Guide for the Perplexed of Our Time'']] 
Nachman HaKohen Krochmal began studying [[Talmud]] at an early age. He married at fourteen as was customary at the time. The girl was the daughter of a wealthy merchant named Habermann. The couple lived with the father-in-law in [[Zhovkva]], near [[Lviv|Lemberg]], where Krochmal devoted himself to full-time study. He learned [[German language|German]] and began to read the [[German philosophy|German philosophers]], especially [[Immanuel Kant]]. He also read [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]] classics, and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] books. After suffering from health problems, he sought treatment in Lemberg. There he met  [[Samuel Judah Löb Rapoport]]. He became Rapoport's teacher, a collaboration that was ultimately fruitful for "Jewish science" ([[Wissenschaft des Judentums]]).

On his return to Żółkiew, he went back to studying philosophy. He delved into the work of Kant, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], whose ideas influenced him greatly. Aside from Rapoport, who often visited him in Żółkiew, he gathered around him a group of young students.

In 1814, after the death of his wife's parents, he went into business. Twelve years later he lost his wife and his health deteriorated. He refused an invitation to the [[rabbi]]nate of [[Berlin]] despite the poor state of his business. Instead he began to work as a bookkeeper in Żółkiew, a position he held from 1836 to 1838. Now seriously ill, he went to stay with his daughter in [[Ternopil|Tarnopol]] and died there two years later.

==Literary career==
Krochmal was reluctant to publish his writings. Apart from several Hebrew essays in periodicals (''Sulamith,'' 1818; ''[[Ha-Tsfira|Ha-Ẓefirah]],'' Zolkiev, 1824; and ''Kerem Ḥemed,'' vols. iv., v.), he wrote only one book,, ''Moreh Nebuke ha-Zeman'' (Lemberg, 1851), edited, according to the author's last will, by [[Leopold Zunz]], whom he admired as a great scholar though they never met. Other editions appeared in Lemberg in 1863 and [[Warsaw]] in 1898. The final, now-standard version of the text was established by [[Simon Rawidowicz]] in 1924. All later printings are facsimiles of the Rawidowicz edition.

===Moreh Nevukhe ha-Zeman===
''Moreh Nevukhe ha-Zeman'' (''Guide for the Perplexed of the Time'') is divided into seventeen chapters, of which the first six deal with [[religion]] in general.

Ch. vii describes [[Israel]]'s spiritual gift as the desire for and faculty of seeking [[God]]. The next three chapters contain a philosophical analysis of [[Jewish history]], which, corresponding to Israel's attachment to the Lord, that is, to its religious development, is divided into three epochs. These epochs terminate respectively: (1) with the death of [[Gedaliah]] after the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]]; (2) with the death of [[Bar Kokba]] (ca. 135); and (3) with the expulsion of the Jews from [[Spain]] (1492). The author does not characterize the modern period in which he himself lived.

Ch. xi-xv deal with the post-exilic [[Biblical]] and the [[Apocrypha]]l literature and with the various religious movements. The author discusses also the necessity of tradition and gives a critical ''résumé'' of the development of the ''[[Halakhah]]'' and ''[[Aggadah]]''.

Ch. xvi gives a brief sketch of the future development of Jewish religious philosophy based on the principles of Hegel. The work finishes with an exposition of [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]]'s philosophy. The historical digressions in the book touch the profoundest problems of Jewish science; and it remains their indisputable merit to have paved the way for critical studies in Jewish history. The work really became, as intended by the author, a "guide" to students of Jewish science in the nineteenth century.
