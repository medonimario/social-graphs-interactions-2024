'''Elihu Palmer''' (1764 – April 7, 1806) was an author and advocate of [[deism]] in the early days of the [[United States]].

==Life==
Elihu Palmer was born in [[Canterbury, Connecticut|Canterbury]], [[Connecticut]] in 1764. He studied to be a [[Presbyterian]] minister at [[Dartmouth College]], where he graduated in 1787. Soon after his graduation, however, he became a deist. After rejecting the Calvinist doctrine of Presbyterianism, Palmer became a physical, spiritual, and intellectual wanderer, ultimately making his way to [[New York City]], where he formed the [[Deistical Society of New York]] in 1796.

He resided for a time in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where he collected materials for [[Jedediah Morse]]'s ''Geography'', and subsequently lived in [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City]]. In 1793 he became totally blind from an attack of yellow fever but continued as a public speaker.

Palmer kept writing until the end of his life and published a number of different written works including "A Fourth of July Oration" (1797), and was also the author of ''[[Principles of Nature|The Principles of Nature, or A Development of the Moral Causes of Happiness and Misery among the Human Species]]''. He also founded two newspapers, ''[[The Temple of Reason]]'' in 1800 and ''[[Prospect, or View of the Moral World]]'' in 1803.
