{{Lutheranism}}
'''Rudolf Otto''' (25 September 1869 – 7 March 1937) was a German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] theologian, philosopher, and [[comparative religion]]ist. He is regarded as one of the most influential [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]] in the early twentieth century and is best known for his concept of the ''[[numinous]]'', a profound emotional experience he argued was at the heart of the world's religions.<ref name= "adler-num">{{cite web|last1= Adler |first1=Joseph|title=Rudolf Otto's Concept of the Numinous|url= http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln101/Otto.htm |publisher=[[Kenyon College]]|location=[[Gambier, Ohio|Gambier]], OH |access-date=19 October 2016}}</ref> While his work started in the domain of [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christian theology]], its main thrust was always [[apologetics|apologetical]], seeking to defend religion against [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] critiques.<ref name= "encyc-com">{{cite encyclopedia |last= Alles |first=Gregory D. |title= Otto, Rudolf |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Religion | location= [[Farmington Hills, Michigan|Farmington hills]], MI |publisher= [[Gale (publisher)|Thomson Gale]] |date=2005 |url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/otto-rudolf |access-date=6 March 2017}}</ref> Otto eventually came to conceive of his work as part of a science of religion, which was divided into the [[philosophy of religion]], the [[history of religion]], and the [[psychology of religion]].<ref name= "encyc-com"/>

==Life==
Born in [[Peine]] near [[Hanover]], Otto was raised in a pious Christian family.<ref name= "yourdiction">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Louis Karl Rudolf Otto Facts|url= http://biography.yourdictionary.com/louis-karl-rudolf-otto| via = YourDictionary | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of World Biography|access-date=24 October 2016}}</ref> He attended the Gymnasium Andreanum in [[Hildesheim]] and studied at the universities of [[University of Erlangen|Erlangen]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], where he wrote his [[dissertation]] on [[Martin Luther]]'s understanding of the [[Holy Spirit]] (''Die Anschauung von heiligen Geiste bei Luther: Eine historisch-dogmatische Untersuchung''), and his [[habilitation]] on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (''Naturalistische und religiöse Weltansicht''). By 1906, he held a position as [[professor|extraordinary professor]], and in 1910 he received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Giessen]].

Otto's fascination with non-Christian religions was awakened during an extended trip from 1911 to 1912 through North Africa, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[British India]], China, Japan, and the United States.<ref name= "britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Meland|first1=Bernard E.|title=Rudolf Otto, German philosopher and theologian|url= https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rudolf-Otto|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|access-date=24 October 2016}}</ref> He cited a 1911 visit to a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] synagogue as a key inspiration for the theme of the Holy he would later develop.<ref name= "yourdiction"/> Otto became a member of the [[Prussian House of Representatives|Prussian parliament]] in 1913 and retained this position through the [[First World War]].<ref name=  "britannica" /> In 1917, he spearheaded an effort to simplify the system of weighting votes in [[Prussia]]n elections.<ref name= "encyc-com"/> He then served in the post-war constituent assembly in 1918, and remained involved in the politics of the [[Weimar Republic]].<ref name="britannica"/>

Meanwhile, in 1915, he became ordinary professor at the [[University of Breslau]], and in 1917, at the [[University of Marburg]]'s Divinity School, then one of the most famous [[Protestant]] [[seminary|seminaries]] in the world. Although he received several other calls, he remained in [[Marburg]] for the rest of his life. He retired in 1929 but continued writing afterward. On 6 March 1937, he died of [[pneumonia]], after suffering serious injuries falling about twenty meters from a tower in October 1936. There were lasting rumors that the fall was a [[suicide attempt]] but this has never been confirmed.<ref name="encyc-com" /> He is buried in the Marburg cemetery.

==Thought==
===Influences===
In his early years Otto was most influenced by the [[German idealist]] theologian and philosopher [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and his conceptualization of the category of the religious as a type of emotion or consciousness irreducible to ethical or rational [[epistemology|epistemologies]].<ref name= "britannica" /> In this, Otto saw Schleiermacher as having recaptured a sense of holiness lost in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Schleiermacher described this religious feeling as one of absolute dependence; Otto eventually rejected this characterization as too closely analogous to earthly dependence and emphasized the complete otherness of the religious feeling from the mundane world (see below).<ref name= "britannica"/> In 1904, while a student at the [[University of Göttingen]], Otto became a proponent of the philosophy of [[Jakob Fries]] along with two fellow students.<ref name="encyc-com"/>

===Early works===
Otto's first book, ''Naturalism and Religion'' (1904) divides the world [[ontology|ontologically]] into the mental and the physical, a position reflecting [[Cartesian dualism]]. Otto argues [[consciousness]] cannot be explained in terms of physical or neural processes, and also accords it epistemological primacy by arguing all knowledge of the physical world is mediated by personal experience. On the other hand, he disagrees with [[Descartes]]' characterization of the mental as a rational realm, positing instead that rationality is built upon a nonrational intuitive realm.<ref name="encyc-com"/>

In 1909, he published his next book, ''The Philosophy of Religion Based on Kant and Fries'', in which he examines the thought of [[Kant]] and Fries and from there attempts to build a philosophical framework within which [[religious experience]] can take place. While Kant's philosophy said thought occurred in a rational domain, Fries diverged and said it also occurred in practical and aesthetic domains; Otto pursued Fries' line of thinking further and suggested another nonrational domain of the thought, the religious. He felt intuition was valuable in rational domains like mathematics, but subject to the corrective of reason, whereas religious intuitions might not be subject to that corrective.<ref name="encyc-com"/>

These two early works were influenced by the [[rationalism|rationalist]] approaches of [[Immanuel Kant]] and Jakob Fries. Otto stated that they focused on the rational aspects of the divine (the "Ratio aeterna") whereas his next (and most influential) book focused on the nonrational aspects of the divine.<ref name="friesian">{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=Kelley|title= Rudolf Otto (1869–1937)|url= http://www.friesian.com/otto.htm|access-date=19 October 2016}}</ref>

===''The Idea of the Holy''===
{{Main|The Idea of the Holy}}
Otto's most famous work, ''[[The Idea of the Holy]]'' was one of the most successful German theological books of the 20th century, has never gone out of print, and is available in about 20 languages. The central argument of the book concerns the term ''[[numinous]]'', which Otto coined. He explains the numinous as a "non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self". This mental state "presents itself as ''ganz Andere'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Otto|first=Rudolf|editor-first=Gregory D. |editor-last=Alles |title=Autobiographical and Social Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C |year=1996 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |location=Berlin |isbn= 978-3-110-14519-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&pg=PA30 30]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Elkins |first=James |author-link=James Elkins (art historian) |editor-last1=Ellenbogen |editor-first1=Josh |editor-last2=Tugendhaft |editor-first2=Aaron |chapter=Iconoclasm and the Sublime.

Otto therefore understands religious experience as having mind-independent [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] content rather than being an internal response to belief in a divine reality.

===Later works===
In ''Mysticism East and West'', published in German in 1926 and English in 1932, Otto compares and contrasts the views of the medieval German [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] [[Meister Eckhart]] with those of the influential [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosopher]] [[Adi Shankara]], the key figure of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] school.<ref name= "encyc-com"/>

==Influence==
Otto left a broad influence on theology, [[religious studies]], and [[philosophy of religion]], which continues into the 21st century.<ref name="oxford"/>

===Christian theology===
[[Karl Barth]], an influential Protestant theologian contemporary to Otto, acknowledged Otto's influence and approved a similar conception of God as ''ganz Andere'' or ''totaliter aliter'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Webb|first=Stephen H.|author-link=Stephen H.

S. Lewis]] indicates a debt, particularly to the idea of the ''numinous'' in ''[[The Problem of Pain]]''. In that book Lewis offers his own description of the numinous:<ref>{{cite book |author= Lewis, C.S. |author-link=C. S.

{{blockquote|Suppose you were told there was a tiger in the next room: you would know that you were in danger and would probably feel fear.  But if you were told "There is a ghost in the next room," and believed it, you would feel, indeed, what is often called fear, but of a different kind. It would not be based on the knowledge of danger, for no one is primarily afraid of what a ghost may do to him, but of the mere fact that it is a ghost.  It is "uncanny" rather than dangerous, and the special kind of fear it excites may be called Dread. With the Uncanny one has reached the fringes of the Numinous. Now suppose that you were told simply "There is a mighty spirit in the room," and believed it. Your feelings would then be even less like the mere fear of danger: but the disturbance would be profound. You would feel wonder and a certain shrinking—a sense of inadequacy to cope with such a visitant and of prostration before it—an emotion which might be expressed in Shakespeare's words "Under it my genius is rebuked." This feeling may be described as awe, and the object which excites it as the ''Numinous.''}}

===Non-Christian theology and spirituality===
Otto's ideas have also exerted an influence on non-Christian theology and spirituality. They have been discussed by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] theologians including [[Joseph Soloveitchik]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=Norman|title=The Reconstruction of Faith|date=2012|publisher=The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization|location=Portland|isbn=978-1-906764-13-5|pages=237–243}}</ref> and [[Eliezer Berkovits]].<ref>[[Eliezer Berkovits|Berkovits, Eliezer]], ''God, Man and History'', 2004, pp. 166, 170.</ref> The Iranian-American [[Sufi]] religious studies scholar and public intellectual [[Reza Aslan]] understands religion as "an institutionalized system of symbols and metaphors [...] with which a community of faith can share with each other their numinous encounter with the Divine Presence."<ref name="aslan">{{cite book|last1=Aslan|first1=Reza|title=No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, And Future of Islam|date=2005|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|location=New York|isbn=1-4000-6213-6|page=xxiii|url=https://archive.org/details/nogodbutgodorigi00asla}}</ref> Further afield, Otto's work received words of appreciation from Indian independence leader [[Mohandas Gandhi]].<ref name="gooch"/> [[Aldous Huxley]], a major proponent of [[Perennial philosophy|perennialism]], was influenced by Otto; in ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' he writes:<ref>{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|title=The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell|year=2004|publisher=Harper Collins|pages=55|isbn=9780060595180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t7_Df4e-6YC}}</ref>

{{blockquote|The literature of [[religious experience]] abounds in references to the pains and terrors overwhelming those who have come, too suddenly, face to face with some manifestation of the ''mysterium tremendum''. In theological language, this fear is due to the in-compatibility between man's egotism and the divine purity, between man's self-aggravated separateness and the infinity of God.}}

===Religious studies===
In ''The Idea of the Holy'' and other works, Otto set out a paradigm for the [[Religious studies|study of religion]] that focused on the need to realize the religious as a non-reducible, original category in its own right.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} The eminent Romanian-American [[History of religions|historian of religion]] and philosopher [[Mircea Eliade]] used the concepts from ''The Idea of the Holy'' as the starting point for his own 1954 book, ''The Sacred and the Profane''.<ref name="oxford">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Sarbacker |first=Stuart |title=Rudolf Otto and the Concept of the Numinous |encyclopedia=Oxford Research Encyclopedias |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=August 2016 |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.013.88 |isbn=9780199340378 |url=https://oxfordre.com/religion/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore-9780199340378-e-88 |access-date=18 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Mircea |last=Eliade |author-link=Mircea Eliade |title=The Sacred and the Profane.

===Psychology===
[[Carl Gustav Jung]], the founder of [[analytic psychology]], applied the concept of the ''numinous'' to [[psychology]] and [[psychotherapy]], arguing it was therapeutic and brought greater self-understanding, and stating that to him religion was about a "careful and scrupulous observation… of the ''numinosum''".<ref name= "num-psych">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Agnel |first=Aimé |title= Numinous (Analytical Psychology) |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/christianity-general/numinous | via = [[Encyclopedia.com]] | encyclopaedia = International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis |access-date=9 November 2016}}</ref> The American [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] priest [[John A.

==Ecumenical activities==
Otto was heavily involved in [[ecumenical]] activities between [[Christian denominations]] and between Christianity and other religions.<ref name="britannica"/> He experimented with adding a time similar to a [[Quaker]] [[moment of silence]] to the Lutheran [[liturgy]] as an opportunity for worshipers to experience the numinous.<ref name="britannica"/>
