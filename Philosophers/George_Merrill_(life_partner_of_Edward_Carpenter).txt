'''George Merrill''' (16 August 1867 – 16 January 1928) was the [[life partner]] of [[Edward Carpenter]], an [[British people|English]] [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]], poet, philosopher and early activist for [[gay rights]].<ref>Bailey, Quentin (2002) "Heroes and Homosexuals: Education and Empire in E. M. Forster" in ''Twentieth Century Literature'' Vol. 48, No. 3 (Autumn, 2002), pp. 324-347.</ref>

Merrill was a working-class man who was born and grew up in the slums of [[Sheffield]]; he had no formal education.<ref name="Rowbotham">{{cite book | last=Rowbotham | first=Sheila | authorlink= Sheila Rowbotham | title=Edward Carpenter: a life of liberty and love | publisher=Verso | location=London | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-84467-295-0}}</ref> He met [[Edward Carpenter]] on a train in 1891, and moved into Carpenter's home, a [[small holding]] at [[Millthorpe, Derbyshire]],<ref>[https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/lgbtq-heritage-project/homes-and-domestic-spaces/millthorpe-and-edward-carpenter/ Historic England.

Merrill arrived at Millthorpe in a blizzard, "trundling with the help of two boys all his worldly goods in a handcart over the hills, and through a disheartening blizzard of snow."<ref name=daysanddreams /> His arrival was commemorated by Carpenter in the poem "Hafiz to the Cupbearer", part of Carpenter's ''Towards Democracy'' which was published in stages between 1882 and 1902.<ref>Carpenter, Edward (2018) ''Towards Democracy''.

Merrill had previously worked in a newspaper office, a hotel, and in an ironworks. He was always officially Carpenter's servant, and he undertook the cooking and cleaning in the home, decorating and placing flowers in every room. Carpenter noted that "George in fact was accepted and one may say beloved by both my manual worker friends and my more aristocratic friends." He had a fine baritone voice and liked to sing comical songs.<ref name=daysanddreams>Carpenter, Edward (1916) ''My Days And Dreams Being Autobiographical Notes''. London: George Allen and Unwin.</ref>

The two lived openly as a couple for almost forty years, until Merrill's death in 1928.<ref>James, Solomon (2017) "Edward Carpenter: Radical Mystic and Lover".

The relationship between Carpenter and Merrill was the inspiration for [[E. M. Forster]]'s novel ''[[Maurice (novel)|Maurice]]'', and the character of the gamekeeper Alec Scudder was in part modelled after George Merrill.<ref name=symondson>Symondson, Kate (25 May 2016) [https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/e-m-forsters-gay-fiction E M Forster’s gay fiction ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200810063000/https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/e-m-forsters-gay-fiction |date=10 August 2020 }}.
