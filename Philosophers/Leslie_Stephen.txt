'''Sir Leslie Stephen''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|KCB|FBA}} (28 November 1832 – 22 February 1904) was an English author, critic, [[historian]], [[biographer]], [[mountaineer]], and an [[Ethical Culture|Ethical movement]] activist. He was also the father of [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Vanessa Bell]].

==Life==
Sir Leslie Stephen came from a distinguished intellectual family,{{sfn|Luebering|2006}} and was born at a house on [[Kensington Gore]], later 42 [[Hyde Park Gate]], in London, the son of [[James Stephen (undersecretary)|Sir James Stephen]] and his wife, Jane Catherine ({{nee}} Venn).{{sfn|Bell|2012}} His father was Colonial Undersecretary of State and a noted [[abolitionist]].{{sfn|Shaw|2008}} He was the fourth of five children, his siblings including [[James Fitzjames Stephen]] (1829–1894) and [[Caroline Emelia Stephen]] (1834–1909).{{sfn|Bell|2012}}

His family had belonged to the [[Clapham Sect]], the early 19th-century group of mainly [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian [[social reform]]ers. At his father's house, he saw a good deal of the [[Zachary Macaulay|Macaulays]], [[James Spedding]], Sir [[Henry Taylor (dramatist)|Henry Taylor]] and [[Nassau William Senior|Nassau Senior]]. Leslie Stephen was educated at [[Eton College]], [[King's College London]] and [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], where he graduated B.A. (20th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]]) in 1854 and M.A. in 1857. He was elected a [[fellow]] of Trinity Hall in 1854 and became a junior tutor in 1856.{{sfn|ACAD|STFN850L}}

In 1859, he was [[ordained]], but his study of philosophy, together with the religious controversies surrounding the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) by [[Charles Darwin]], caused him to lose his faith in 1862, and in 1864 he resigned from his positions at Cambridge, and moved to London. He recounted some of his experiences in a chapter in his ''Life of Fawcett'' as well as in some less formal ''Sketches from Cambridge: By a Don'' (1865). These sketches were reprinted from ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'', to the proprietor of which, [[George Murray Smith]], he had been introduced by his brother.{{sfn|Luebering|2006}}

=== Marriage ===
====(1) Harriet (Minny) Thackeray 1867–1875====
[[File:Harriet and Leslie Stephen 1867.jpg|thumb|Harriet and Leslie Stephen, 1867]]
[[File:Harriet Marian Thackeray Stephen, Kensal Green Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Harriet's grave, Kensal Green Cemetery]]
The family connections included that of [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]. His brother, Fitzjames had been a friend of Thackeray's and assisted in the disposition of his estate when he died in 1863. His sister Caroline met Thackeray's daughters, [[Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie|Anny]] (1837–1919) and [[Harriet Stephen|Minny]] (1840–1875) when they were mutual guests of [[Julia Margaret Cameron]] (of whom, see later). This led to an invitation to visit from Leslie Stephen's mother, Lady Stephen, where the sisters met him. They also met at George Murray Smith's house at Hampstead. Minny and Leslie became engaged on 4 December 1866 and married on 19 June 1867.

After the wedding, they travelled to the [[Swiss Alps]] and [[Northern Italy]], and on return to England lived at the Thackeray sisters' home at 16 Onslow Gardens with Anny, who was a novelist. In the spring of 1868 Minny [[miscarried]] but recovered sufficiently for the couple to tour the eastern United States. Minny miscarried again in 1869, but became pregnant again in 1870 and on 7 December gave birth to their daughter, Laura Makepeace Stephen (1870–1945). Laura was premature, weighing three pounds. In March 1873, Thackeray and the Stephens moved to 8 Southwell Gardens.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hobhouse |first1=Hermione |title=The Alexander estate Pages 168-183 Survey of London: Volume 42, Kensington Square To Earl's Court.

She went to the [[Alps]] and came back slightly better, but got back pains by October{{ndash}}November. On the evening of 27 November, she went to bed, fell into convulsions, and died the following day of [[eclampsia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bicknell|1996a|p=281}}: "Pregnant in the summer of 1875 and feeling unwell, Minny went to the Alps and returned some{{shy}}what improved, but by October and November she was complaining of back pains and during the evening of the 27th went to bed, fell into con{{shy}}vul{{shy}}sions and died of eclampsia the next day."</ref>

After Minny's death, Leslie Stephen continued to live with Anny, but they moved to 11 Hyde Park Gate South in 1876, next door to her widowed friend and collaborator, Julia Duckworth. Leslie Stephen and his daughter were also cared for by his sister, the writer [[Caroline Emelia Stephen]], although Leslie described her as "Silly Milly" and her books as "little works".<ref name="lewis">{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Alison M.|title=Caroline Stephen and her niece, Virginia Woolf|journal=Journal of the Fellowship of Quakers in the Arts|date=Spring 2001|issue=21|url=http://www.quaker.org/fqa/types/t21-woolf.html|access-date=10 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Maynard|1994|p=156}}: “I had a perhaps rather pedantic mania for correcting {{nowrap|[Anny’s]}} flights of i{{shy}}ma{{shy}}gi{{shy}}na{{shy}}tion and checking her exuberant impulses. {{nowrap|A.[nny]}} and {{nowrap|M.[inny]}} used to call me the cold bath from my habit of drenching Anny’s little schemes and fancies with chilling criticism”</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bicknell|1996a|p=8}}: "Apparently, however, he did not sufficiently re{{shy}}cog{{shy}}nise the effect his self-indulgent, violent language had on others; his sister Milly could hardly bear them."</ref> Meanwhile, Anny was falling in love with her younger cousin [[Richmond Ritchie]], to Leslie Stephen's consternation. Ritchie became a constant visitor and they became engaged in May 1877 and were married on 2 August. At the same time, Leslie Stephen was seeing more and more of Julia Duckworth.

====(2) Julia Duckworth 1878–1895====
[[File:Julia Duckworth in Garden, by Julia Margaret Cameron.jpg|thumb|Julia Duckworth by [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], 1872]]
{{see also|Julia Duckworth}}
His second marriage was to [[Julia Stephen|Julia Prinsep Duckworth]] (née Jackson, 1846–1895). Julia had been born in India and after returning to England she became a model for [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painters such as [[Edward Burne-Jones]].<ref>[http://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/rarebook/exhibitions/stephen/31a.htm Smith College libraries biography of Julia Prinsep Stephen]</ref> In 1867, she had married Herbert Duckworth (1833 − 1870) by whom she had three children prior to his death in 1870.

Leslie Stephen and Julia Duckworth were married on 26 March 1878. They had four children:
* [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]] (1879–1961), who married [[Clive Bell]]
* [[Thoby Stephen|Thoby]] (1880–1906)
* [[Virginia Woolf|Virginia]] (1882–1941), who married [[Leonard Woolf]]
* [[Adrian Stephen|Adrian]] (1883–1948)

In May 1895, Julia died of influenza, leaving her husband with four young children aged 11 to 15 (her children by her first marriage being adults by then).{{sfn|Gérin|1981|loc=p.&nbsp;178}}

===Career===
In the 1850s, Stephen and his brother James were invited by [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] to lecture at [[The Working Men's College]]. Leslie Stephen became a member of the college's governing College Corporation.<ref name=Harrison>[[J. F. C. Harrison]], ''A History of the Working Men's College (1854–1954),'' Routledge Kegan Paul (1954)</ref>

Stephen was an [[honorary fellow]] of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], and received the honorary degree [[Doctor of Letters]] (D.Litt.) from the [[University of Cambridge]] and from the [[University of Oxford]] (November 1901<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |title=University intelligence |date=27 November 1901 |page=6 |issue=36623}}</ref>).
While at Cambridge, Stephen became an [[Anglican]] clergyman. In 1865, having renounced his religious beliefs, and after a visit to the United States two years earlier, where he had formed lasting friendships with [[Oliver Wendell Holmes&nbsp;Jr.]], [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Charles Eliot Norton]], he settled in London and became a journalist, eventually editing ''[[The Cornhill Magazine]]'' in 1871 where [[Robert Louis Stevenson|R.&nbsp;L. Stevenson]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[William Edward Norris|W.&nbsp;E. Norris]], [[Henry James]], and [[James Payn]] figured among his contributors.

In his spare time, he participated in athletics and [[mountaineering]]. He also contributed to the ''Saturday Review'', ''Fraser'', ''Macmillan'', the ''Fortnightly'', and other periodicals. He was already known as a climber, as a contributor to ''Peaks, Passes and Glaciers'' (1862), and as one of the earliest presidents of the [[Alpine Club]], when, in 1871, in commemoration of his own [[first ascent]]s in the [[Alps]], he published ''The Playground of Europe'', which immediately became a mountaineering classic, drawing—together with [[Edward Whymper|Whymper]]'s ''Scrambles Amongst the Alps'' — successive generations of its readers to the Alps.

During the eleven years of his editorship, in addition to three volumes of critical studies, he made two valuable contributions to philosophical history and theory. The first was ''The History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century'' (1876 and 1881). This work was generally recognised as an important addition to philosophical literature and led immediately to Stephen's election at the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in 1877. The second was ''The Science of Ethics'' (1882). It was extensively adopted as a textbook on the subject and made him the best-known proponent of [[evolutionary ethics]] in late-nineteenth-century Britain. He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1901.<ref>[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlists American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]</ref>

Leslie Stephen also served as the first editor (1885–91) of the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the Bath]] (KCB) in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list published on 26 June 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |title=The Coronation Honours |date=26 June 1902 |page=5 |issue=36804}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27453 |date=11 July 1902 |page=4441}}</ref>

=== Beliefs ===
As an adult, Stephen was an [[agnostic atheist]] who wrote extensively about his views. In ''Social Rights and Duties'', he explained how he came to lose his faith of his parents: "When I ceased to accept the teaching of my youth, it was not so much a process of giving up beliefs as of discovering that I never really believed."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life and Letters of Leslie Stephen|page=133|editor=Frederic William Maitland|year=2012}}</ref> His second wife, Julia, was similarly activist in her writings on agnosticism.

He advocated for more people of this view to claim the label "agnostic" for themselves, eschewing the harder associations of the unadorned term "atheist", reflecting the fact that no one who claims disbelief in gods does so on the basis of professing absolute ''knowledge'' about the universe. He concluded his essay "An Agnostic's Apology" with a reply to religious critics who hold atheists and agnostics in contempt:

{{blockquote|"Til then, we shall be content to admit openly what you whisper under your breath or hide in technical jargon, that the ancient secret is secret still; that man knows nothing of the Infinite and Absolute; and that, knowing nothing, he had better not be dogmatic about his ignorance. And, meanwhile, we will endeavour to be as charitable as possible, and whilst you trumpet forth officially your contempt for our skepticism, we will at least try to believe that you are imposed upon by your own bluster."|Leslie Stephen<ref>{{cite book|chapter=An Agnostic's Apology|last=Stephen|first=Leslie|editor=Christopher Hitchens|editor-link=Christopher Hitchens|title=The Portable Atheist|page=111|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2007}}</ref> }}

Stephen was very involved in the organised [[Ethical Culture|Ethical movement]]. He served multiple terms as President of the West London Ethical Society (part of the Union of Ethical Societies).<ref>{{cite book|title=Leslie Stephen's life in letters: a bibliographical study|last=Fenwick|first=Gillian|page =125|year=1993}}</ref> He gave numerous addresses and lectures to the ethical society during his tenure as president, which are collected at length across multiple volumes of writings. He was an active organiser in the movement, and in one lecture, entitled "The aims of ethical societies", set about the task of defining the broader social purpose which animated the wider [[Ethical Culture|Ethical movement]] at that time.<ref>{{cite book|title=Social Rights And Duties: Addresses to Ethical Societies (Complete)|author=Sir Leslie Stephen|year=2002|publisher=Library of Alexandria}}</ref>

=== Mountaineering ===
[[File:Sir Leslie Stephen by George Frederic Watts 1878.jpeg|thumb|right|Leslie Stephen painted by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1878.]]
Stephen was one of the most prominent figures in the [[golden age of alpinism]] (the period between [[Alfred Wills|Wills]]'s ascent of the [[Wetterhorn]] in 1854 and [[Edward Whymper|Whymper]]'s ascent of the [[Matterhorn]] in 1865) during which many major alpine peaks saw their first ascents. Joining the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] in 1857 (the year of its formation), Stephen made the first ascent, usually in the company of his favourite Swiss guide [[Melchior Anderegg]], of the following peaks:
* [[Wildstrubel]] – 11 September 1858 with [[Thomas Woodbine Hinchliff|T. W. Hinchliff]] and Melchior Anderegg
* [[Bietschhorn]] – 13 August 1859 with Anton Siegen, Johann Siegen and Joseph Ebener
* [[Rimpfischhorn]] – 9 September 1859 with Robert Living, Melchior Anderegg and Johann Zumtaugwald
* [[Alphubel]] – 9 August 1860 with T. W. Hinchliff, Melchior Anderegg and Peter Perren
* [[Blüemlisalp]]horn – 27 August 1860 with Robert Living, Melchior Anderegg, F. Ogi, P. Simond and J. K. Stone
* [[Schreckhorn]] – 16 August 1861 with Ulrich Kaufmann, Christian Michel and Peter Michel
* [[Jungfraujoch]] – July 1862 with [[Hereford Brooke George|H. B. George]], [[Henry Morgan (academic)|Henry Morgan]], F. J. Hardy, Living,<!--name--> and Moore<!--name-->.
* [[Monte Disgrazia]] – 23 August 1862 with [[Edward Shirley Kennedy|E. S. Kennedy]], Thomas Cox and Melchior Anderegg
* [[Zinalrothorn]] – 22 August 1864 with [[Florence Crauford Grove]], Jakob Anderegg and Melchior Anderegg
* [[Mont Mallet]] – 4 September 1871 with G. Loppe, F. A. Wallroth, Melchior Anderegg, Ch. and A. Tournier

He was President of the Alpine Club from 1865 to 1868 and edited the ''[[Alpine Journal]]'', 1868–1872.

== Death ==
[[File:The grave of Sir Leslie Stephen, Highgate Cemetery, London.JPG|thumb|Leslie Stephen's grave, Highgate Cemetery]]
He died in [[Kensington]] and is buried in the eastern section of [[Highgate Cemetery]] in the raised section alongside the northern path. His daughter, Virginia Woolf, was badly affected by his death and she was cared for by his sister, Caroline.<ref name=lewis/> Woolf in 1927 created a detailed psychological portrait of him in the fictional character of Mr. Ramsay in her classic novel,
''[[To the Lighthouse]]'', (as well as of her mother as Mrs. Ramsay). (Ref: The Diaries and Letters of Virginia Woolf) His [[probate]] is worded: STEPHEN sir Leslie of 22 Hyde Park-gate Middlesex K.C.B. probate London 23 March to George Herbert Duckworth and Gerald de L'Etang Duckworth esquires Effects £15715 6s. 6d.{{sfn|Archives|2018}}

To honour his memory, his friends held a lecture in 1907 at the [[University of Cambridge]], which has been held bi-annually as the ''[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Portal:Leslie_Stephen_Lecture Leslie Stephen Lecture]'' since. His friends endowed that it be held with the specification that it be on "some literary subject, including therein criticism, biography and ethics."<ref>{{cite web |title=Leslie Stephen Lecture 2010: The Dark Sixteenth Century |url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/leslie-stephen-lecture-2010-the-dark-sixteenth-century |website=University of Cambridge |access-date=15 June 2021 |language=en |date=2010-10-29}}</ref>
