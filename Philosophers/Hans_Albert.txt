'''Hans Albert''' (8 February 1921 {{endash}} 24 October 2023) was a German philosopher. He was professor of social sciences at the [[University of Mannheim]] from 1963, and remained at the university until 1989.<ref name="ORF" /> His fields of research were social sciences and general studies of methods. He was a [[critical rationalist]], paying special attention to [[rationality|rational]] [[heuristics]]. Albert was a strong critic of the [[Continental philosophy|continental]] [[hermeneutic]] tradition coming from [[Heidegger]] and [[Gadamer]].

== Life and career ==
Albert was born in [[Cologne]], Germany, on 8 February 1921, the son of a teacher of Latin and history.<ref name="Taschwer" /> In 1950 he earned a degree in business administration at the [[University of Cologne]], followed by a PhD in social politics in 1952.<ref name="Taschwer" /> From 1952&ndash;1958 he worked as an assistant at the research institute for social and administrative sciences at the university, where he also obtained a Dr. habil. in social politics in 1957. As a lecturer he read [[logic]], [[theory of science]] and economics of the [[welfare state]]. Beginning in 1958 he participated in the Alpbacher Hochschulwochen (a summer conference in the Austrian alpine village of [[Alpbach]]), where he met [[Karl Popper]] after having studied and mostly embracing his philosophy.<ref name="Taschwer" /> After 1955, he had discussions with [[Paul Feyerabend]], who in those times was a critical rationalist and an admirer of Karl Popper. Their letters were later published. In 1963, Albert received the Social Sciences and General Studies of Methods chair (later named Sociology and Studies of Economics) at Wirtschaftshochschule Mannheim (later [[University of Mannheim]]).<ref name="Taschwer" />

1961&ndash;1969 was the time of the so-called ''Positivismusstreit'' ([[positivism dispute]]), the debate between Karl Popper and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] concerning [[positivism]] within German [[sociology]] during the 1960s. Albert participated at this meanwhile famous Tagung der deutschen Gesellschaft für Soziologie (Conference of the German Society of Sociology) in 1961 in Tübingen. In the beginning there was no dispute on positivism, because both Adorno and Popper were opposed to positivism. The debate was more about the differences between [[social sciences]] and [[natural sciences]] and the status of values in the social sciences. In 1963, the debate was continued by [[Jürgen Habermas]] in the ''Festschrift für Adorno''. In 1964, in the Soziologentag (Conference on Sociology) in Heidelberg, the debate grew into an excited discussion between Habermas and Albert. The dispute culminated in a collection of essays, published in 1969 and translated into several languages. This dispute gained a broad audience.

In 1989, Albert retired from active service as a [[Professor Emeritus|professor emeritus]], but continued writing books and giving lectures at many universities, such as the 1990 lectures at the University of Graz on Critical Rationalism, the 1995 Walter Adolf Lectures at Hochschule St. Gallen, and the 1998 Wittgenstein-Lectures at the University of Bayreuth (with Rainer Hegselmann) about [[critical rationalism]].

=== Personal life ===
Albert lived in [[Heidelberg]] with his Austrian wife; they had a son.<ref name="Taschwer" /> On 8 February 2021, Hans Albert reached 100 years of age, thus becoming a [[centenarian]].<ref name="Institut">{{Cite web|url=https://hans-albert-institut.de/hans-albert-ein-jahrhundertdenker|title = Hans Albert – ein Jahrhundertdenker | website=hans-albert-institut.de |date=2021 |language=de}}</ref>

=== Critical rationalism ===
<!--He is also a much-cited philosopher.-->{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2023}}

Albert developed [[Karl Popper|Popper]]'s critical rationalism into a concise, broad-ranging [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]], thereby extending it from a method to progress in science to one equally applicable in day-to-day heuristics. To substantiate his approach, he provided evidence for his thesis that there is no field of human activities where one should not be critical. Consequently, he advocated applying critical rationalism to the social sciences, especially to [[economics]], [[politics]], [[jurisprudence]], and [[religion]]. In his view, the attitude of criticism is one of the oldest European traditions (going back to the [[pre-Socratics]]), in comparison with other less critical traditions.

Before his many books were published, Albert was already known to a broader audience for his contributions to the positivism dispute, arguing against his opponents of the so-called [[Frankfurt School]] of Theodor W. Adorno and [[Max Horkheimer]] at the Frankfurt Institute of Sociology. His contributions included
* differentiating between critical rationalism and positivism
* arguing against some strains of sociology opposing the application of methods used in natural sciences
* suggesting that the role of [[values]] and the scientific handling of values has to be given new thought
* interpreting [[Max Weber]] not as supporting value-free science, but as demonstrating that scientists can "be free of any value judgement", even for research in the fields of values.

Albert observed that new insights are often difficult to spread or proliferate. He ascribed this phenomenon's cause to ideological obstacles, for which Albert coined the phrase "immunity against criticism".

Albert's well known ''[[Münchhausen trilemma]]'' is ironically named after [[Baron Munchausen]], who allegedly pulled himself out of a swamp seizing himself by his shock of hair. This trilemma rounds off the classical problem of [[Theory of justification|justification in the theory of knowledge]]. It concludes that all attempts to rationally justify or rather ultimately verify a thesis must inherently fail. This verdict concerns not only deductive justifications, as many of his critics believe, but also inductive, causal, transcendental, and all otherwise structured justifications. As Albert reasoned, they all will be in vain, since a justification inevitably faces one of three flaws:
# All justification in pursuit of ''certain'' knowledge simultaneously has to justify the means of justification or rather the validity of its premises – an effort which leads to an [[infinite regress]].
# One can cut the chain of reasons short, for instance, by pointing to self-evidence or common sense or fundamental principles or another basic premise that shall not be further questioned. But in doing so the intention to arrive at a universally valid justification is abandoned, because the reasoning cannot be accepted, unless one (irrationally) accepts the validity of one premise for its own sake.
# The third horn of the trilemma is the equally unsatisfying application of a circular argument.

Albert stressed repeatedly that there is no limitation of the Münchhausen trilemma to [[deductive]] conclusions. Hence, Albert pointed out, justification is rendered virtually impossible regardless of the specific content of a thesis, justification is impossible at all. From this notion, Albert drew the conclusion that progress in science can only be achieved by means of [[Falsifiability|falsification]] rather than inductive verification.

To observe and criticize the endeavors made to escape from the quagmire of certain justification became an instructive part of Hans Albert's philosophy. A prominent example of these efforts is his discussion of the ideas of [[Karl-Otto Apel]], one of Germany's leading philosophers, in his book ''Transzendentale Träumereien'' (Transcendental Reveries)''.''

Still, Albert argued that critical rationalists have to accept that those attempts of rigorous justification (like Apel's) are not entirely futile, since only as long as alternative methods are without success can critical rationalism be called successful.

=== Style of writing and criticizing ===
Albert's plea is for critical rationalism. He avoided solemn preaching in favor of serious, serene discussion with people of different faith and thinking. While Popper always warned not to follow one's opponent into the mire,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Albert followed them into their favored field of thinking on their own terms. So he criticized [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger's]] "being in the abyss" ("Sein im Ab-Grund"),<ref>Hans Albert, ''Kritik der reinen Hermeneutik &ndash; Der Antirealismus und das Problem des Verstehens'', Tübingen (Mohr Siebeck) 1994, chap. I</ref> [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer's]] "horizons melting together",<ref>Hans Albert, ''Kritik der reinen Hermeneutik &ndash; Der Antirealismus und das Problem des Verstehens'', Tübingen (Mohr Siebeck) 1994, chap. II</ref> [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas's]] "consensual theoretical truth in the ideal discourse",<ref>Hans Albert, ''Kritik der reinen Hermeneutik &ndash; Der Antirealismus und das Problem des Verstehens'', Tübingen (Mohr Siebeck) 1994, chap. VIII</ref> [[Karl-Otto Apel| Karl-Otto Apel's]] transcendental arguments,<ref>Hans Albert, ''Transzendentale Träumereien. Karl-Otto Apels Sprachspiele und sein hermeneutischer Gott'', Hamburg (Hoffmann und Campe) 1975; Hans Albert, ''Kritik des transzendentalen Denkens. Von der Begründung des Wissens zur Analyse der Erkenntnispraxis'', Tübingen (Mohr Siebeck) 2003</ref> and the theologian [[Hans Küng| Hans Küng's]] "absolute-relative, this-life-and-hereafter, transcendental-immanent, allconcerning-allcontrolling most real reality in the very heart of things".<ref>Hans Albert, ''Das Elend der Theologie. Kritische Auseinandersetzung mit Hans Küng'', Hamburg (Hoffmann und Campe)1979; 2nd ed. Aschaffenburg (Alibri) 2005</ref> Hans Albert meticulously followed their arguments<ref>Much of the mentioned criticism is repeated in the English written Hans Albert, ''Between Social Science, Religion, and Politics. Essays on Critical Rationalism'', Amsterdam-Atlanta (Rodopi) 1999</ref> to uncover:
* undiscovered premises
* new and often fatal consequences
* new and often better alternatives.

Underlying suppositions and injunctions of Albert's method are:{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
* Only if all currently proposed alternatives to critical rationalism are untenable may one live with critical rationalism.
* There is value in keeping an open mind and learning from discussion. Other people may be right; thus give credit to their thinking.
* One should keep away from solemn gravity.
* One should avoid the moralising know-it-all but not conceal one's preferred way of life.
