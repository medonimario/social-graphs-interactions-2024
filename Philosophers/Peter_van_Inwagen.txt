== Career ==
Van Inwagen's 1983 [[monograph]] ''An Essay on Free Will''{{sfn|van Inwagen|1983}} played an important role in rehabilitating [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]] with respect to [[free will]] in mainstream [[analytical philosophy]].{{sfn|Kane|2005|p=23}} In the book, he introduces the term [[incompatibilism]] about free will and [[determinism]], to stand in contrast to [[compatibilism]]—the view that free will is compatible with determinism.{{refn|group=note|Indeed, some philosophers suggest free will must be compatible with determinism, otherwise we could not be responsible for our actions.<ref name="HOBART">{{cite journal |last1=Hobart|first1=R. E. |title=I. Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It |journal=Mind |year=1934 |volume=XLIII |issue=169 |pages=1–27 |doi=10.1093/mind/XLIII.169.1}}</ref>}}

Van Inwagen's central argument (the ''[[consequence argument]]'') for this view is that "If determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws of nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what went on before we were born, and neither is it up to us what the laws of nature are. Therefore, the consequences of those things (including our present acts) are not up to us."<ref>''Essay'', v</ref>

Van Inwagen also added what he called the ''Mind Argument'' (after the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', where such arguments often appeared). "The ''Mind'' argument proceeds by identifying indeterminism with [[Indeterminism#Philosophy|chance]] and by arguing that an act that occurs by chance, if an event that occurs by chance can be called an act, cannot be under the control of its alleged agent and hence cannot have been performed freely. Proponents of [this argument] conclude, therefore, that free will is not only compatible with determinism but entails determinism."<ref>''Essay'', 16</ref>

The ''Consequence Argument'' and the ''Mind Argument'' are the two horns in the classic dilemma and standard argument ''against'' free will.{{fact|date=April 2020}} If determinism is true, our actions are not free. If indeterminism is true, our actions are influenced by randomness and our [[Will (philosophy)|will]] cannot be [[Moral responsibility|morally responsible]] for them.<ref name="Smart">{{cite journal |last1=Smart |first1=J. J. C. |title=Free-Will, Praise and Blame |journal=Mind |year=1961 |volume=70 |issue=279 |pages=291–306 |doi=10.1093/mind/LXX.279.291 |jstor=2251619 |issn=0026-4423}}</ref>

Van Inwagen concludes that "Free Will Remains a Mystery."{{sfn|van Inwagen|2000|p=14}} In an article written in the third person called "Van Inwagen on Free Will,"{{sfn|van Inwagen|2004|loc=Chapter 10}} he describes the problem with his incompatibilist free will if random ''chance directly causes our actions''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chance NOT the Direct Cause of Human Action |url=http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/chance_direct_cause.html |website=Information Philosopher |access-date=April 13, 2020 |archive-date=April 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200420110136/http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/chance_direct_cause.html |url-status=live }}</ref> He imagines the universe reverting a thousand times to ''exactly the same circumstances''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/same_circumstances.html |title=Exactly The Same Circumstances |website=Informationphilosopher.com |access-date=November 17, 2017 |archive-date=November 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122185655/http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/same_circumstances.html |url-status=live }}</ref> it was in at some earlier time and observing all the "replays." If the agent's actions are random, she sometimes "would have agent-caused the crucial brain event and sometimes (in seventy percent of the replays, let us say) she would not have... I conclude that even if an episode of agent causation is among the causal antecedents of every voluntary human action, these episodes do nothing to undermine the prima facie impossibility of an undetermined free act."{{sfn|van Inwagen|2017|p=227}}

In his book ''Material Beings'',<ref>Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1995</ref> Van Inwagen argues that all material objects are either elementary particles or living organisms. Every composite material object is made up of elementary particles, and the only such composite objects are living organisms. A consequence of this view is that everyday objects such as tables, chairs, cars, buildings, and clouds do not exist. While there seem to be such things, this is only because there are elementary particles arranged in specific ways. For example, where it seems that there is a chair, Van Inwagen says that there are only ''elementary particles arranged chairwise.'' These particles do not compose an object, any more than a swarm of bees composes an object. Like a swarm of bees, the particles we call a chair maintain a more or less stable arrangement for a while, which gives the impression of a single object. An individual bee, by contrast, has parts that are unified in the right way to constitute a single object (namely, a bee).

Van Inwagen gave the 2003 [[Gifford Lectures]]; they are published in his ''The Problem of Evil''.<ref>Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006</ref> There Van Inwagen argues that the [[problem of evil]] is a philosophical argument and, like most philosophical arguments, fails.

Van Inwagen has shown an interest in the [[afterlife]] debate, particularly in relation to [[Resurrection|resurrection of the body]]. In his article "I Look for the Resurrection of the Dead and the Life of the World to Come", he concludes that Christians must account for some sort of physical continuity in their account of existence of the same person after death. In particular, Van Inwagen notes, this is a problem for the [[Christian materialism|Christian materialist]], one who believes that human beings are physical substances.
