A forerunner of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Spinoza significantly influenced modern [[biblical criticism]], 17th-century [[rationalism]], and Dutch intellectual culture, establishing himself as one of the most important and radical philosophers of the [[early modern period]].{{sfn|Nadler|2018|pp=xiii-xiv}} Influenced by [[Stoicism]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[René Descartes]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Schmitter |first=Amy M. |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-link=Edward N.

Spinoza was born in [[Amsterdam]] to a [[Marrano]] family that fled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] for the more tolerant [[Dutch Republic]]. He received a traditional Jewish education, learning [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and studying sacred texts within the Portuguese Jewish community, where his father was a prominent merchant. As a young man, Spinoza challenged rabbinic authority and questioned Jewish doctrines, leading to his [[Herem (censure)|permanent expulsion]] from the Jewish community in 1656. Following his excommunication, he distanced himself from all religious affiliations and devoted himself to philosophical inquiry and lens grinding. Spinoza attracted a dedicated circle of followers who gathered to discuss his writings and joined him in the intellectual pursuit of truth.

Spinoza published little to avoid persecution and bans on his books. In his ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'', described by [[Steven Nadler]] as "one of the most important books of Western thought", Spinoza questioned the divine origin of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the nature of [[God]] while arguing that ecclesiastic authority should have no role in a secular, democratic state.{{sfn|Nadler|2011|pp=xi-xii}}{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=332}} ''[[Ethics (Spinoza book)|Ethics]]'' argues for a [[pantheistic]] view of God and explores the place of human freedom in a world devoid of theological, cosmological, and political moorings.{{sfn|Stewart|2006|p=308}} Rejecting messianism and the emphasis on the afterlife, Spinoza emphasized appreciating and valuing life for oneself and others. By advocating for individual liberty in its moral, psychological, and metaphysical dimensions, Spinoza helped establish the genre of political writing called [[secular theology]].{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp=2-3}}

Spinoza's philosophy spans nearly every area of philosophical discourse, including [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[Political Philosophy|political philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[Philosophy of Mind|philosophy of mind]], and [[Philosophy of Science|philosophy of science]]. His friends posthumously published his works, captivating philosophers for the next two centuries. Celebrated as one of the most original and influential thinkers of the seventeenth century, [[Rebecca Goldstein]] dubbed him "the renegade Jew who gave us modernity."{{sfn|Goldstein|2006|p=i}}

==Biography==
[[File: Mozes en Aaronkerk 1.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Mozes en Aäronkerk|Moses and Aaron Church]] now stands at the site of Spinoza's childhood home.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=115}}]]

===Family background===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Amsterdam}}

Spinoza's ancestors, adherents of [[Crypto-Judaism]], faced persecution during the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], enduring torture and public displays of humiliation. In 1597, his paternal grandfather's family left [[Vidigueira]] for [[Nantes]] and lived outwardly as [[New Christians]],{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=85-87}} eventually transferring to Holland for an unknown reason.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=134}} His maternal ancestors were a leading [[Oporto]] commercial family,{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=88}} and his maternal grandfather was a foremost merchant who drifted between Judaism and Christianity.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=299}} Spinoza was raised by his grandmother from ages six to nine and probably learned much about his family history from her.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=124}}

Spinoza's father Michael was a prominent and wealthy merchant in Amsterdam with a business that had wide geographical reach.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=158}} In 1649, he was elected to serve as an administrative officer of the recently united congregation [[Portuguese Synagogue (Amsterdam)|Talmud Torah]].{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=144}} He married his cousin Rachael d'Espinosa, daughter of his uncle Abraham d'Espinosa, who was also a community leader and Michael's business partner.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=140}} Marrying cousins was common in the Portuguese Jewish community then, giving Michael access to his father-in-law's commercial network and capital.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=140-41}} Rachel's children died in infancy, and she died in 1627.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=38}}{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=140-41}}

After the death of Rachel, Michael married Hannah Deborah, with whom he had five children. His second wife brought a dowry to the marriage that was absorbed into Michael's business capital instead of being set aside for her children, which may have caused a grudge between Spinoza and his father.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=183}} The family lived on the artificial island on the south side of the River Amstel, known as the [[Vlooienburg]], at the fifth house along the [[Houtgracht]] canal.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=115}} The Jewish quarter was not formally divided. The family lived close to the Bet Ya'acov synagogue, and nearby were Christians, including the artist [[Rembrandt]].{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=117}} Miriam was their first child, followed by Isaac who was expected to take over as head of the family and the commercial enterprise but died in 1649.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=183}} Baruch Espinosa, the third child, was born on 24 November 1632 and named as per tradition for his maternal grandfather.{{sfn|Nadler|1999|p=45}}

Spinoza's younger brother Gabriel was born in 1634, followed by another sister Rebecca. Miriam married [[Caceres family|Samuel de Caceres]] but died shortly after childbirth. According to Jewish practice, Samuel had to marry his former sister-in-law Rebecca.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=185}} Following his brother's death, Spinoza's place as head of the family and its business meant scholarly ambitions were pushed aside.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=158}} Spinoza's mother, Hannah Deborah, died when Spinoza was six years old. Michael's third wife, Esther, raised Spinoza from age nine; she lacked formal Jewish knowledge due to growing up a New Christian and only spoke Portuguese at home. The marriage was childless.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=145-46}} Spinoza's sister Rebecca, brother Gabriel, and nephew eventually migrated to [[History of the Jews in Curaçao|Curaçao]], and the remaining family joined them after Spinoza's death.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=185}}

====Uriel da Costa's early influence====
[[File:Dacosta und Spinoza.jpg|left|thumb|240x240px|[[Samuel Hirszenberg]]'s imagined scene of Uriel da Costa instructing Spinoza (1901)]]
Through his mother, Spinoza was related to the philosopher [[Uriel da Costa]], who stirred controversy in Amsterdam's Portuguese Jewish community.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=159}} Da Costa questioned traditional Christian and Jewish beliefs, asserting that, for example, their origins were based on human inventions instead of God's revelation. His clashes with the religious establishment led to his excommunication twice by rabbinic authorities, who imposed humiliation and social exclusion.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=160}} In 1639, as part of an agreement to be readmitted, da Costa had to prostrate himself for worshippers to step over him. He died in 1640, reportedly committing suicide.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=161}}

During his childhood, Spinoza was likely unaware of his family connection with Uriel da Costa; still, as a teenager, he certainly heard discussions about him.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=90}} [[Steven Nadler]] explains that, although da Costa died when Spinoza was eight, his ideas shaped Spinoza's intellectual development. Amsterdam's Jewish communities long remembered and discussed da Costa's skepticism about organized religion, denial of the soul's immortality, and the idea that Moses didn't write the Torah, influencing Spinoza's intellectual journey.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=84}}

===School days and the family business===
[[File:Baruch Espinosa crossed out from pupil list, Ets Haim, Amsterdam, 17th century.jpeg|thumb|Spinoza's name crossed out on the list of pupils of Talmud Torah]]
Spinoza attended the Talmud Torah school adjoining the Bet Ya'acov synagogue, a few doors down from his home, headed by the senior Rabbi [[Saul Levi Morteira]].{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=148–49}}{{sfn|Nadler|1999|pp=65–66}} Instructed in Spanish, the language of learning and literature, students in the elementary school learned to read the prayerbook and the [[Torah]] in Hebrew, translate the weekly section into Spanish, and study [[Rashi]]'s commentary.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|pp=72-75}} Spinoza's name does not appear on the registry after age fourteen, and he likely never studied with rabbis such as [[Manasseh ben Israel]] and Morteira. Spinoza possibly went to work around fourteen and almost certainly was needed in his father's business after his brother died in 1649.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=93}}

During the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], much of the Spinoza firm's ships and cargo were captured by [[Commonwealth of England|English]] ships, severely affecting the firm's financial viability. The firm was saddled with debt by the war's end in 1654 due to its merchant voyages being intercepted by the English, leading to its decline.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|pp=100-101}}{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=206}} Spinoza's father died in 1654, making him the head of the family, responsible for organizing and leading the Jewish mourning rituals, and in a business partnership with his brother of their inherited firm.{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=204-05}} As Spinoza's father had poor health for some years before his death, he was significantly involved in the business, putting his intellectual curiosity on hold.{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=205-06}} Until 1656, he continued financially supporting the synagogue and attending services in compliance with synagogue conventions and practice.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=210}} By 1655, the family's wealth had evaporated and the business effectively ended.{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=205-06}}

In March 1656, Spinoza went to the city authorities for protection against debts in the Portuguese Jewish community. To free himself from the responsibility of paying debts owed by his late father, Spinoza appealed to the city to declare him an orphan;{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=25}} since he was a legal minor, not understanding his father's indebtedness would remove the obligation to repay his debts and retrospectively renounce his inheritance.{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=220-22}} Though he was released of all debts and legally in the right, his reputation as a merchant was permanently damaged in addition to violating a synagogue regulation that business matters are to be arbitrated within the community.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=222}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=25}}

===Expulsion from the Jewish community===
[[File:Hirszenberg, Spinoza wyklêty (Excommunicated Spinoza), 1907.jpg|thumb|''Excommunicated Spinoza'' by [[Samuel Hirszenberg]] (1907), the second of his two modern paintings imagining scenes of Spinoza's life.]]

Amsterdam was tolerant of religious diversity so long as it was practiced discreetly. The community was concerned with protecting its reputation and not associating with Spinoza lest his controversial views provide the basis for possible persecution or expulsion.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|pp=17–22}} Spinoza did not openly break with Jewish authorities until his father died in 1654 when he became public and defiant, resulting from lengthy and stressful religious, financial, and legal clashes involving his business and synagogue, such as when Spinoza violated synagogue regulations by going to city authorities rather than resolving his disputes within the community to free himself from paying his father's debt.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=25}}

On 27 July, 1656, the Talmud Torah community leaders, which included [[Isaac Aboab da Fonseca|Aboab de Fonseca]],{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=74}} issued a writ of ''[[Herem (censure)|herem]]'' against the 23-year-old Spinoza.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=21}}{{sfn|Touber|2018|p=45}} Spinoza's censure was the harshest ever pronounced in the community, carrying tremendous emotional and spiritual impact.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|pp=2-7}} The exact reason for expelling Spinoza is not stated, only referring to his "abominable heresies", "monstrous deeds", and the testimony of witnesses "in the presence of the said Espinoza".{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=xx}} Even though the Amsterdam municipal authorities were not directly involved in Spinoza's censure, the town council expressly ordered the Portuguese-Jewish community to regulate their conduct and ensure that the community kept strict observance of Jewish law.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=19}} Other evidence indicates a concern about upsetting civil authorities, such as the synagogue's bans on public weddings, funeral processions, and discussing religious matters with Christians, lest such activity might "disturb the liberty we enjoy".{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=20}}

[[File:Ban of Baruch Spinoza, Amsterdam, 27 July 1656, 6 Av 5416.jpg|thumb|Text of Spinoza's expulsion on 6 Av 5416 (27 July 1656)]]
Before the expulsion, Spinoza had not published anything or written a treatise; [[Steven Nadler]] states that if Spinoza was voicing his criticism of Judaism that later appeared through his philosophical works, such as Part I of [[Ethics (Spinoza book)|''Ethics'']], then there can be no wonder that he was severely punished.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=16}}{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=160}} Unlike most censures issued by the Amsterdam congregation, it was never rescinded since the censure did not lead to repentance. After the censure, Spinoza may have written an [[Apologia]] in Spanish defending his views, but it is now lost.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}} Spinoza's expulsion did not lead him to convert to Christianity or belong to a confessional religion or sect.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=338}} From 1656 to 1661, Spinoza found lodgings elsewhere in Amsterdam and Leiden, supporting himself with teaching while learning lens grinding and constructing microscopes and telescopes.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=243}} Spinoza did not maintain a sense of Jewish identity; he argued that without adherence to Jewish law, the Jewish people lacked a sustaining source of difference and identity, rendering the notion of a secular Jew incoherent.{{sfn|Nadler|2011|p=167}}

===Education and study group===
Sometime between 1654 and 1657, Spinoza started studying Latin with political radical [[Franciscus van den Enden]], a former [[Jesuit]] and atheist, who likely introduced Spinoza to scholastic and modern philosophy, including Descartes, who had a dominant influence on Spinoza's philosophy.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|pp=129-30}} While boarding with Van den Enden, Spinoza studied in his school, where he learned the arts and sciences and likely taught others.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|pp=125-26}}{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=229-30}} Many of his friends were either secularized freethinkers or belonged to dissident Christian groups that rejected the authority of established churches and traditional dogmas.{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=342}}{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=164}} Spinoza was acquainted with members of the [[Collegiants]], a group of disaffected [[Mennonite]]s and other dissenting Reformed sects that shunned official theology and must have played some role in Spinoza's developing views on religion and directed him to Van Enden.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=168}} [[Jonathan Israel]] conjectures that another possible influential figure was atheist translator [[Jan Hendriksz Glazemaker]], a collaborator of Spinoza's friend and publisher Rieuwertsz, who could not have mentored Spinoza but was in a unique position to introduce Spinoza to Cartesian philosophy, mathematics, and lens grinding.{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=338-39}}

After learning Latin with Van Enden, Spinoza studied at [[Leiden University]] around 1658,{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=184}} where he audited classes in Cartesian philosophy.{{efn|[[Steven Nadler]] speculates that Spinoza Latinized his name at Leiden because all instruction was in Latin.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=193}}}} From 1656 to 1661, Spinoza's main discussion partners who formed his circle and played a formative part in Spinoza's life were Van den Enden, [[Pieter Balling]], Jarig Jelles, [[Lodewijk Meyer]], [[Johannes Bouwmeester]] and [[Adriaan Koerbagh]].{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=333-38}} Spinoza's following, or philosophical sect,{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=322}} scrutinized the propositions of the ''Ethics'' while it was in draft and Spinoza's second text, ''Short Treatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being''.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=330}} Though a few prominent people in Amsterdam discussed the teachings of the secretive but marginal group, it was mainly a testing ground for Spinoza's philosophy to extend his challenge to the status quo.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=350}} Their public reputation in Amsterdam was negative, with [[Ole Borch]] disparaging them as "atheists".{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=344}} Throughout his life, Spinoza's general approach was to avoid intellectual battles, clashes, and public controversies, viewing them as a waste of energy that served no real purpose.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=343}}

===Career as a philosopher===
====Rijnsburg====
[[File: Spinoza museum Rijnsburg 2.jpg|thumb|Spinoza's lodging in Rijnsburg, now a museum]]
Between 1660 and 1661, Spinoza moved from Amsterdam to [[Rijnsburg]], allowing for a quiet retreat in the country and access to the university town, Leiden, where he still had many friends.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=214}} Around this time, he wrote his ''Short Treatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being'', which he never published in his lifetime, thinking it would enrage the theologians, synods, and city magistrates.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=456}}{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=225}} The ''Short Treatise'', a long-forgotten text that only survived in Dutch translation, was first published by [[Johannes van Vloten]] in 1862.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=330}} While lodging with Herman Homan in Rijnsburg, Spinoza produced lenses and instruments to support himself and out of scientific interest.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|pp=215-16}} He began working on his ''Ethics'' and ''Descartes' Principles of Philosophy'', which he completed in two weeks, communicating and interpreting Descartes' arguments and testing the water for his metaphysical and ethical ideas. Spinoza's explanations of essential elements of the Cartesian system helped many interested people study the system, enhancing his philosophical reputation. This work was published in 1663 and was one of the two works published in his lifetime under his name.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|pp=243-45}} Spinoza led a modest and frugal lifestyle, earning income by polishing lenses and crafting telescopes and microscopes.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=215}} He also relied on the generous contributions of his friends to support himself.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=305}}

====Voorburg====
In 1663, Spinoza moved to [[Voorburg]] for an unknown reason. He continued working on ''Ethics'' and corresponded with scientists and philosophers throughout Europe. In 1665,{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=264}} he began writing the ''Theological-Political Treatise'', which addresses theological and political issues such as the interpretation of scripture, the origins of the state, and the bounds of political and religious authority while arguing for a secular, democratic state.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=290}}{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=332}} Before the publication of the ''Theological-Political Treatise'', Spinoza's friend [[Adriaan Koerbagh]] published a book that criticized organized religion, denied the divine authorship of the Bible, and asserted that miracles were impossible—ideas similar to those of Spinoza.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|pp=309-11}} His work attracted the attention of the authorities, leading to his imprisonment and eventual death in prison. Anticipating the reaction to his ideas, Spinoza published his treatise in 1670 under a false publisher and a fictitious place of publication.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=314}} The work did not remain anonymous for long.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=339}} [[Samuel Maresius]] attacked Spinoza personally, while [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Johannes Bredenburg]] criticized his conception of God and saw the book as dangerous and subversive.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=343}} Spinoza's work was safer than Koerbagh's because it was written in Latin, a language not widely understood by the general public, and Spinoza explicitly forbade its translation.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=346}} The secular authorities varied enforcing the Reformed Church in Amsterdam's orders to ban the distribution of the blasphemous book.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=344}}

====The Hague====
[[File: Spinoza House, The Hague (2016) 01.png|thumb|Spinoza's house in The Hague, where he died]]
In 1670, Spinoza moved to [[The Hague]] to have easier access to the city's intellectual life and to be closer to his friends and followers.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=334}} As he became more famous, Spinoza spent time receiving visitors and responding to letters. He returned to the manuscript of ''Ethics'', reworking part Three into parts Four and Five, and composed a Hebrew grammar for proper interpretation of scripture and for clearing up confusion and problems when studying the Bible, with part One presenting etymology, the alphabet, and principles governing nouns, verbs, and more. Part Two, unfinished before he died, would have presented syntax rules.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|pp=375-79}} Another unfinished work from 1676 was ''[[Tractatus Politicus]]'', which concerns how states can function well and intended to show that democratic states are best.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=399}} Spinoza refused an offer to be the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Heidelberg]], perhaps because of the possibility that it might curb his [[freedom of thought]].{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=363}}

====Correspondence====
{{See also|Epistolae (Spinoza)|List of Epistolae (Letters) of Spinoza}}
Few of Spinoza's letters are extant, and none before 1661.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=xiii}} Nearly all the contents are philosophical and technical because the original editors of ''Opera Posthuma''—a collection of his works published posthumously—Lodewijk Meyer, Georg Hermann Schuller, and Johannes Bouwmeester, excluded personal matters and letters due to the political and ecclesiastical persecution of the time.{{sfn|Shirley|2002|p=755}} Spinoza corresponded with [[Peter Serrarius]], a radical Protestant and [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] merchant, who was a patron of Spinoza after his expulsion from the Jewish community. He acted as an intermediary for Spinoza's correspondence, sending and receiving letters of the philosopher to and from third parties. They maintained their relationship until Serrarius died in 1669.{{sfn|Popkin|1999|p=381}}{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=296}}

[[File:Spinoza Letter to Leibniz.jpg|thumb|left|Letter from Spinoza to Leibniz, with his BdS seal]]
Through his pursuits in lens grinding, mathematics, optics, and philosophy, Spinoza forged connections with prominent figures such as scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]], mathematician [[Johannes Hudde]], and Secretary of the [[British Royal Society]] [[Henry Oldenburg]]. Huygens and others notably praised the quality of Spinoza's lenses.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|pp=259-61}} Spinoza engaged in correspondence with [[Willem van Blijenbergh]], an amateur [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theologian, who sought Spinoza's view on the nature of evil and sin. Whereas Blijenbergh deferred to the authority of scripture for theology and philosophy, Spinoza told him not solely to look at scripture for truth or anthropomorphize God. Also, Spinoza told him their views were incommensurable.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|pp=252-54}} [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] outwardly described Spinoza's work negatively but privately wrote letters to him and desired to examine the manuscript of the ''Ethics''.{{sfn|Stewart|2006|pp=11-12}} In 1676, Leibniz traveled to The Hague to meet Spinoza, remaining with him for three days to converse about current events and philosophy.{{sfn|Stewart|2006|pp=14-15}} Leibniz's work bears some striking resemblances to parts of Spinoza's philosophy, like in [[Monadology]]. Leibniz was concerned when his name was not redacted in a letter printed in the ''Opera Posthuma''.{{sfn|Buruma|2024|pp=166-67}} In 1675, Albert Burgh, a friend and possibly former pupil of Spinoza, wrote to him repudiating his teachings and announcing his conversion to the Catholic Church. Burgh attacked Spinoza's views as expressed in the ''Theological-Political Treatise'' and tried to persuade Spinoza to embrace Catholicism. In response, Spinoza, at the request of Burgh's family, who hoped to restore his reason, wrote an angry letter mocking the Catholic Church and condemning all religious superstition.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|pp=390-93}}

Spinoza published little in his lifetime, and most formal writings were in Latin, reaching few readers. Apart from ''Descartes' Principles of Philosophy'' and the ''Theologico-Political Treatise'', his works appeared in print after his death. Because the reaction to his anonymously published work, ''Theologico-Political Treatise'', was unfavorable, Spinoza told supporters not to translate his works and abstained from publishing further.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=346}}{{sfn|Stewart|2006|p=106}} Following his death, his supporters published his works posthumously in Latin and Dutch. His posthumous works–''Opera Posthuma''–were edited by his friends in secrecy to prevent the confiscation and destruction of manuscripts.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=22}} He wore a [[signet ring]] to mark his letters, engraved with the Latin word ''Caute'', meaning "Caution", and the image of a thorny rose.{{sfn|Stewart|2006|p=106}}

====Death and rescue of unpublished writings====

When he was buried, no tombstone or plaque was prepared. His vault was close to [[Johan de Witt]]'s remains.]]
Spinoza's health began to fail in 1676, and he died in The Hague on 21 February 1677 at age 44, attended by a physician friend, Georg Herman Schuller. Spinoza had been ill with some form of lung affliction, probably [[tuberculosis]] and possibly complicated by [[silicosis]] brought on by grinding glass lenses.{{sfn|Gullan-Whur|1998|pp=317-18}} Although Spinoza had been becoming sicker for weeks, his death was sudden, and he died without leaving a will.{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=1150-1151}}{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=406}} Reports circulated that he repented his philosophical stances on his deathbed, but these tales petered out in the 18th century. Lutheran preacher Johannes Colerus wrote the first biography of Spinoza for the original reason of researching his final days.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=1155}}

By the time of his death, he had never married and had no children.<ref name="x962">{{cite web | last=Cartwright | first=Mark | title=Baruch Spinoza | website=World History Encyclopedia | date=2024-01-29 | url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Baruch_Spinoza/ | access-date=2024-09-09}}</ref>

Spinoza was buried inside the [[Nieuwe Kerk (The Hague)|Nieuwe Kerk]] four days after his death, with six others in the same vault. At the time, there was no memorial plaque for Spinoza. In the 18th century, the vault was emptied, and the remnants scattered over the earth of the churchyard. The memorial plaque is outside the church, where some of his remains are part of the churchyard's soil.{{sfn|Israel|2023|p=1158}} Spinoza's friends rescued his personal belongings, papers, and unpublished manuscripts. His supporters took them away for safekeeping from seizure by those wishing to suppress his writings, and they do not appear in the inventory of his possessions at death. Within a year of his death, his supporters translated his Latin manuscripts into Dutch and other languages.{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=409}} Secular authorities and later the Roman Catholic Church banned his works.{{sfn|Israel|1996|p=3}}{{sfn|Totaro|2015|pp=321-22}}

[[File:Spinoza Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.jpg|thumb]]
{{Main|Tractatus Theologico-Politicus}}{{See also|Thomas Hobbes}}
Despite being published in Latin rather than a vernacular language, this 1670 treatise published in Spinoza's lifetime caused a huge reaction described as "one of the most significant events in European intellectual history."{{sfn|Nadler|2011|pp=xi-xii}}{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=776}}{{sfn|Simkins|2014}}

===''Ethics''===
{{Main|Ethics (Spinoza book)}}
The ''Ethics'' has been associated with that of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[René Descartes]] as part of the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] school of thought,<ref>{{cite web |last=Montanarelli |first=Lisa |title=Spinoza stymies 'God's attorney' / Stewart argues the secular world was at stake in Leibniz face off |url=https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/spinoza-stymies-god-s-attorney-stewart-argues-2543764.php |website=SFGate |access-date=20 March 2024}}</ref> which includes the assumption that ideas correspond to reality perfectly, in the same way that mathematics is supposed to be an exact representation of the world. The ''Ethics'', a "superbly cryptic masterwork", contains many unresolved obscurities and is written with a forbidding mathematical structure modeled on Euclid's geometry. The writings of [[René Descartes]] have been described as "Spinoza's starting point".<ref name=tws9912>{{cite news

}}</ref> Spinoza's first publication was his 1663 geometric exposition of proofs using [[Euclid]]'s model with definitions and axioms of Descartes' ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''. Following Descartes, Spinoza aimed to understand truth through logical deductions from 'clear and distinct ideas', a process which always begins from the 'self-evident truths' of [[axiom]]s.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|pages=31–32}} However, his actual project does not end there: from his first work to his last one, there runs a thread of "attending to the highest good" (which also is the highest truth) and thereby achieving a state of peace and harmony, either metaphysically or politically. In this light, the Principles of Philosophy might be viewed as an "exercise in geometric method and philosophy", paving the way for numerous concepts and conclusions that would define his philosophy (see Cogitata Metaphysica).{{sfn|Shirley|2002|p=109}}

====Metaphysics====
Spinoza's [[metaphysics]] consists of one thing, substance, and its modifications (modes). Early in ''The Ethics'' Spinoza argues that only one substance is absolutely [[Infinity|infinite]], self-caused, and eternal. He calls this substance "[[God]]", or "[[Nature]]". He takes these two terms to be [[synonymous]] (in the [[Latin]] the phrase he uses is ''"Deus sive Natura"''). For Spinoza, the whole of the [[natural]] [[universe]] consists of one substance, God, or, what is the same, Nature, and its modifications (modes).
{{blockquote|It cannot be overemphasized how the rest of Spinoza's philosophy—his philosophy of mind, his epistemology, his psychology, his moral philosophy, his political philosophy, and his philosophy of religion—flows more or less directly from the metaphysical underpinnings in Part I of the ''Ethics''.{{sfn|Della Rocca|2008|p=33}}}}

=====Substance, attributes, and modes=====
{{Blockquote|Spinoza sets forth a vision of Being, illuminated by his awareness of God. They may seem strange at first sight. To the question "What is?" he replies: "Substance, its attributes, and modes".|[[Karl Jaspers]]{{sfn|Jaspers|1974|p=9}}}}

Following [[Maimonides]], Spinoza defined [[Substance theory|substance]] as "that which is in itself and is conceived through itself", meaning that it can be understood without any reference to anything external.<ref name=Scruton41>{{harvnb|Scruton|2002|page=41}}</ref> Being conceptually independent also means that the same thing is [[Ontology|ontologically]] independent, depending on nothing else for its existence and being the 'cause of itself' (''causa sui'').<ref name=Scruton41 /> A mode is something which cannot exist independently but rather must do so as part of something else on which it depends, including properties (for example color), relations (such as size) and individual things.<ref name=Scruton42>{{harvnb|Scruton|2002|page=42}}</ref> Modes can be further divided into 'finite' and 'infinite' ones, with the latter being evident in every finite mode (he gives examples of "motion" and "rest").{{sfn|Scruton|2002|page=43}} The traditional understanding of an [[Property (philosophy)|attribute]] in philosophy is similar to Spinoza's modes, though he uses that word differently.<ref name=Scruton42 /> To him, an attribute is "that which the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance", and there are possibly an infinite number of them.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|page=44}} It is the essential nature that is "attributed" to reality by intellect.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|page=45}}
[[File:Portrait of a man, thought to be Baruch de Spinoza, attributed to Barend Graat.jpg|thumb|180px|Probable portrait of Spinoza, by [[Barend Graat]], 1666]]

Spinoza defined [[God]] as "a substance consisting of infinite attributes, each of which expresses eternal and infinite essence", and since "no cause or reason" can prevent such a being from existing, it must exist.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|page=45}} This is a form of the [[ontological argument]], which is claimed to prove the existence of God, but Spinoza went further in stating that it showed that only God exists.<ref name=Scruton38>{{harvnb|Scruton|2002|page=38}}</ref> Accordingly, he stated that "Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can exist or be conceived without God".<ref name=Scruton38 />{{sfn|Lin|2007|p=273}} This means that God is identical with the universe, an idea which he encapsulated in the phrase "''Deus sive Natura''" ('God or Nature'), which some have interpreted as [[atheism]] or [[pantheism]].{{sfn|Scruton|2002|page=51}} Though there are many more of them, God can be known by humans either through the attribute of extension or the attribute of thought.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|page=57}} Thought and extension represent giving complete accounts of the world in mental or physical terms.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|page=59}} To this end, he says that "the mind and the body are one and the same thing, which is conceived now under the attribute of thought, now under the attribute of extension".{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=60}}

After stating his proof for God's existence, Spinoza addresses who "God" is. Spinoza believed that God is "the sum of the natural and physical laws of the universe and certainly not an individual entity or creator".<ref>Cannon, J. A. (2009, May 17). World in time of upheaval: Sources of enlightenment. Deseret News.</ref> Spinoza attempts to prove that God is just the substance of the universe by first stating that substances do not share attributes or essences and then demonstrating that God is a "substance" with an infinite number of attributes, thus the attributes possessed by any other substances must also be possessed by God. Therefore, God is just the sum of all the substances of the universe. God is the only substance in the universe, and everything is a part of God. This view was described by [[Charles Hartshorne]] as [[Classical Pantheism]].<ref name="auto4">Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, "Philosophers Speak of God", Humanity Books, 1953 ch. 4</ref>

Spinoza argues that "things could not have been produced by God in any other way or in any other order than is the case".<ref>Baruch Spinoza. ''Ethics'', in'' Spinoza: Complete Works'', trans. by Samuel Shirley and ed. by Michael L. Morgan (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002), see Part I, Proposition 33.</ref> Therefore, concepts such as 'freedom' and 'chance' have little meaning.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|page=51}} This picture of Spinoza's determinism is illuminated in ''Ethics'': "the infant believes that it is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak."{{sfn|Curley|1996|p=73}} In his letter to G. H. Schuller (Letter 58), he wrote: "men are conscious of their desire and unaware of the causes by which [their desires] are determined."<ref>''Ethics'', Pt. I, Prop. XXXVI, Appendix: "[M]en think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed of them so to wish and desire."</ref> He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it into an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]].{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=86}}

According to Eric Schliesser, Spinoza was skeptical regarding the possibility of knowledge of nature and as a consequence at odds with scientists such as Galileo and Huygens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9223/ |website=PhilSci-Archive |title = "Spinoza and the Philosophy of Science: Mathematics, Motion, and Being"|date = 9 July 2012}}</ref>

=====Causality=====
Although the [[principle of sufficient reason]] is commonly associated with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], Spinoza employs it in a more systematic manner. In Spinoza's philosophical framework, questions concerning why a particular phenomenon exists are always answerable, and these answers are provided in terms of the relevant cause. Spinoza's approach involves first providing an account of a phenomenon, such as goodness or consciousness, to explain it, and then further explaining the phenomenon in terms of itself. For instance, he might argue that consciousness is the degree of power of a mental state.{{sfn|Della Rocca|2008|p=30}}

Spinoza has also been described as an "[[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] materialist",<ref name="tws9912" /> specifically in reference to his opposition to Cartesian mind-body dualism. This view was held by Epicureans before him, as they believed that atoms with their probabilistic paths were the only substance that existed fundamentally.<ref name="Konstan">{{Cite SEP|last=Konstan|first=David|url-id=epicurus|title=Epicurus|date=July 8, 2022}}</ref>{{sfn|Curley|1996|p=118}} Spinoza, however, deviated significantly from Epicureans by adhering to strict determinism, much like the Stoics before him, in contrast to the Epicurean belief in the probabilistic path of atoms, which is more in line with contemporary thought on [[quantum mechanics]].<ref name="Konstan" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Baruch Spinoza, "Human Beings are Determined"|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/spinoza.shtml|access-date=21 February 2017|work=Lander.edu}}</ref>

=====The emotions=====
One thing which seems, on the surface, to distinguish Spinoza's view of the emotions from both [[René Descartes|Descartes']] and [[David Hume|Hume's]] pictures of them is that he takes the emotions to be [[cognition|cognitive]] in some important respect. [[Jonathan Bennett (philosopher)|Jonathan Bennett]] claims that "Spinoza mainly saw emotions as caused by cognitions. [However] he did not say this clearly enough and sometimes lost sight of it entirely."{{sfn|Bennett|1984|p=276}}
Spinoza provides several demonstrations which purport to show truths about how human emotions work. The picture presented is, according to Bennett, "unflattering, coloured as it is by universal [[egoism]]".{{sfn|Bennett|1984|p=277}}

====Ethical philosophy====
[[File:Benedictus de Spinoza cover portrait.jpg|thumb|Engraving of Spinoza, captioned in Latin, "A Jew and an atheist"; he vehemently denied being an atheist.]]

Spinoza's notion of blessedness figures centrally in his ethical philosophy. Spinoza writes that blessedness (or salvation or freedom), "consists, namely, in a constant and eternal love of God, or in God's love for men.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Spinoza |first=Benedictus de |url=https://archive.org/details/ethics0000spin_w3j0 |title=Ethics |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=1996 |isbn=9780140435719 |pages=176}}</ref> Philosopher [[Jonathan Bennett (philosopher)|Jonathan Bennett]] interprets this as Spinoza wanting "'blessedness' to stand for the most elevated and desirable state one could possibly be in."{{sfn|Bennett|1984|p=371}} Understanding what is meant by "most elevated and desirable state" requires understanding Spinoza's notion of ''[[conatus]]'' (''striving'', but not necessarily with any [[teleology|teleological]] baggage){{citation needed|date=February 2024}} and that "perfection" refers not to (moral) value, but to completeness. Given that individuals are identified as mere modifications of the infinite Substance, it follows that no individual can ever be fully complete, i.e., perfect, or blessed. Absolute perfection, is, in Spinoza's thought, reserved solely for Substance. Nevertheless, modes can attain a lesser form of blessedness, namely, that of pure understanding of oneself as one really is, i.e., as a definite modification of Substance in a certain set of relationships with everything else in the universe. That this is what Spinoza has in mind can be seen at the end of the ''[[Ethics (Spinoza book)|Ethics]]'', in E5P24 and E5P25, where Spinoza makes two final key moves, unifying the metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical propositions he has developed over the course of the work. In E5P24, he links the understanding of particular things to the understanding of God, or Substance; in E5P25, the ''conatus'' of the mind is linked to the third kind of knowledge (''Intuition''). From here, it is a short step to the connection of Blessedness with the ''amor dei intellectualis'' ("intellectual love of God").{{citation needed|date=February 2024}}

===''Tractatus Politicus'' (Political Treatise) (TP)===
{{Main|Tractatus Politicus}}
[[File:Spinoza, Tractatus Politicus Titlepage.jpg|thumb|The title page of the ''Tractatus politicus'' in the ''Opera Posthuma''.]]
This unfinished treatise in Latin expounds Spinoza's ideas about forms of government. As with the ''Ethics'', this work was published posthumously by his circle of supporters in Latin and in Dutch. The subtitle is "''In quo demonstratur, quomodo Societas, ubi Imperium Monarchicum locum habet, sicut et ea, ubi Optimi imperant, debet institui, ne in Tyrannidem labatur, et ut Pax, Libertasque civium inviolata maneat''." ("In which it is demonstrated how a society, may it be a [[monarchy]] or an [[aristocracy]], can be best governed, so as not to fall into [[tyranny]], and so that the peace and liberty of the citizens remain unviolated").

Although Spinoza's political and theological thought was radical on many ways, he held traditional views on the place of women. In the TP, he writes briefly on the last page of the TP that women were "naturally" subordinate to men, stating bluntly his women are "by nature" not by "institutional practice" subordinate to men. Both his major biographers in English remark on his view of women. Biographer [[Steven Nadler]] is clearly disappointed by Spinoza's only statement on women. "It is unfortunate that the very last words we have by him, at the end of the extant chapters of the ''Political Treatise'', are a short digression … on the unsuitability of women to hold political power."{{sfn|Nadler|2018|p=495}} Likewise [[Jonathan I. Israel]] says that Spinoza's views are "hugely disappointing to the modern reader" and that most that can be said in his defense is that "in his age rampant tyrannizing over women was indeed universal." He goes on to say, "one may legitimately wonder why did Spinoza, if he was to be consistent, not apply his highly sceptical and innovative, for his time uniquely subversive, de-legtimizing general principle likewise to men's tyrannizing over women."{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=895-96}} One scholar has attempted to rationalize Spinoza's views excluding women from full citizenship.<ref>Matheron, Alexandre, “Femmes et serviteurs dans lad démocratie spinoziste.” Revue philosophique de la la France et de l’étranger 2 (1977) 181-200</ref> But the topic has not attracted major consideration in Spinoza studies.

==Pantheism==
{{see also|Pantheism controversy}}
Spinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word "God" [Deus] to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. "Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law...."<ref>Frank Thilly, ''A History of Philosophy'', § 47, Holt & Co., New York, 1914</ref> Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God differs from the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.<ref>"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings." These words were spoken by Albert Einstein, upon being asked if he believed in God by Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue, New York, April 24, 1921, published in the New York Times, April 25, 1929; from ''Einstein: The Life and Times'' Ronald W. Clark, New York: World Publishing Co., 1971, p. 413; also cited as a telegram to a Jewish newspaper, 1929, Einstein Archive 33–272, from Alice Calaprice, ed., ''The Expanded Quotable Einstein'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University</ref>

In 1785, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] published a condemnation of Spinoza's pantheism, after [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Gotthold Lessing]] was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a "Spinozist", which was the equivalent in his time of being called an [[atheist]]. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute atheism. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and pantheism. The issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time.
{{clear left}}
The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late 18th-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
* the unity of all that exists;
* the regularity of all that happens;
* the identity of spirit and nature.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lange|first1=Frederick Albert|title=History of Materialism and Criticism of its Present Importance, Vol. II|date=1880|publisher=Houghton, Osgood, & Co.|location=Boston|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmateria02lang/page/147 147]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmateria02lang|access-date=11 November 2015}}</ref>
By 1879, Spinoza's pantheism was praised by many, but was considered by some to be alarming and dangerously inimical.<ref>"The Pantheism of Spinoza Dr. Smith regarded as the most dangerous enemy of Christianity, and as he announced his conviction that it had gained the control of the schools, press and pulpit of the Old World [Europe], and was rapidly gaining the same control of the New [United States], his alarm and indignation sometimes rose to the eloquence of genuine passion." ''Memorial of the Rev. Henry Smith, D.D., LL D., Professor of Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology in [[Lane Theological Seminary]], Consisting of Addresses on Occasion of the Anniversary of the Seminary, 8 May 1879, Together with Commemorative Resolutions'', p. 26.</ref>

Spinoza's "God or Nature" (''Deus sive Natura'') provided a living, natural God, in contrast to [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[first cause argument]] and the dead mechanism of [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]]'s (1709–1751) work, ''[[Man a Machine]]'' (''{{lang|fr|L'homme machine}})''. Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a ''religion of nature''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gottlieb |first=Anthony |title=God Exists, Philosophically |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/18/reviews/990718.18gottlit.html |website=archive.nytimes.com |access-date=18 March 2024}}</ref> [[Novalis]] called him the "God-intoxicated man".<ref name=tws9912/><ref name=tws9902>{{cite news

}}</ref> Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay "[[The Necessity of Atheism]]".<ref name=tws9912/>

It is a widespread belief that Spinoza equated God with the material universe. He has therefore been called the "prophet"<ref>Picton, J. Allanson, "Pantheism: Its Story and Significance", 1905.</ref> and "prince"<ref>Fraser, Alexander Campbell "Philosophy of Theism", William Blackwood and Sons, 1895, p. 163.</ref> and most eminent expounder of [[pantheism]]. More specifically, in a letter to Henry Oldenburg he states, "as to the view of certain people that I identify God with Nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken".<ref>Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza, Wilder Publications (26 March 2009), {{ISBN|978-1-60459-156-9}}, letter 73.</ref> For Spinoza, the universe (cosmos) is a ''mode'' under two ''attributes'' of Thought and [[Extension (metaphysics)|Extension]]. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in the world.

According to German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] (1883–1969), when Spinoza wrote ''{{lang|la|Deus sive Natura}}'' (Latin for 'God or Nature'), Spinoza meant God was ''natura naturans'' (nature doing what nature does; literally, 'nature naturing'), not ''natura naturata'' (nature already created; literally, 'nature natured'). Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's immanence.<ref name="ts64">{{harvnb|Jaspers|1974|pp=14, 95}}</ref> Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course "divisible"; it has parts. But Spinoza said, "no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided", meaning that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance. He also said, "a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible" (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13).<ref name="ts65">Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (2 October 1996), {{ISBN|978-0-415-10782-2}}, p. 40</ref> Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore, according to Jaspers, the pantheist formula "One and All" would apply to Spinoza only if the "One" preserves its transcendence and the "All" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.<ref name=ts64/>

[[Martial Guéroult]] (1891–1976) suggested the term [[panentheism]], rather than pantheism to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but in a strong sense, "in" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God.<ref name=ts65/> However, American panentheist philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897–2000) insisted on the term [[Classical Pantheism]] to describe Spinoza's view.<ref name="auto4"/>

According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Spinoza's God is an "infinite intellect" (''Ethics'' 2p11c) — all-knowing (2p3), and capable of loving both himself—and us, insofar as we are part of his perfection (5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends ''amor intellectualis dei'' (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that "neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God" (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is not a being who could ever love us back. "He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return", says Spinoza (5p19).<ref>{{Cite SEP|url-id=pantheism|title=Pantheism|last=Mander|first=William|date=August 17, 2023}}</ref>

[[Steven Nadler]] suggests that settling the question of Spinoza's atheism or pantheism depends on an analysis of attitudes. If pantheism is associated with religiosity, then Spinoza is not a pantheist, since Spinoza believes that the proper stance to take towards God is not one of reverence or religious awe, but instead one of objective study and reason, since taking the religious stance would leave one open to the possibility of error and superstition.<ref name="SEPNadler">{{Cite SEP|url-id=spinoza|title=Baruch Spinoza|first=Steven|last=Nadler|author-link=Steven Nadler|date=Nov 8, 2023}}</ref>

==Other philosophical connections==
Many authors have discussed similarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions. Few decades after the philosopher's death, [[Pierre Bayle]], in his famous ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique|Historical and Critical Dictionary]]'' (1697) pointed out a link between Spinoza's alleged atheism with "the theology of a Chinese sect", supposedly called "Foe Kiao",<ref>Pierre Bayle. ''[https://archive.org/details/dictionnairehis42unkngoog/page/96/mode/1up?view=theater Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]'', vol. 13 (in French). Libraire Desoer, Paris, 1820, p. 416 </ref> of which had learned thanks to the testimonies of the Jesuit missions in Eastern Asia. A century later, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] also established a parallel between the philosophy of Spinoza and the thinking of [[Laozi]] (a "monstrous system" in his words), grouping both under the name of pantheists, criticizing what he described as mystical tendencies in them.<ref>Immanuel Kant.

Transl. and edited by Allen W. Wood and George Di Giovanni. Cambridge University Press, p.228 </ref>

The 19th-century German Sanskritist [[Theodor Goldstücker]] was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the [[Vedanta]] tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was "... so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines..."<ref>Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker, W.

Spinoza's ideas have had a major impact on intellectual debates from the seventeenth century to the current era. How Spinoza is viewed has gone from the atheistic author of treatises that undermine Judaism and organized religion, to a cultural hero, the first secular Jew.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.autodidactproject.org/other/spinoza.html | title=Ralph Dumain: "The Autodidact Project": "Spinoza, the First Secular Jew?" by Yirmiyahu Yovel }}</ref> One writer contends that what draws readers to Spinoza today and "makes him perhaps the most beloved philosopher since Socrates, is his confident equanimity".

Israel]], argues that "No leading figure of the post-1750 later Enlightenment, for example, or the nineteenth century, was engaged with the philosophy of Descartes, Hobbes, Bayle, Locke, or Leibniz, to the degree leading figures such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], Goethe, Kant, Hegel, Fichte, Schelling, Heine, [[George Eliot]], and Nietzsche, remained preoccupied throughout their creative lives with Spinoza."{{sfn|Israel|2023|pp=1205}} [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770-1831) asserts that "The fact is that Spinoza is made a testing-point in modern philosophy, so that it may really be said: You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all."<ref name="Hegel's History of Philosophy">{{cite book |author= Hegel Society of America.

His expulsion from the Portuguese synagogue in 1656 has stirred debate over the years on whether he is the "first modern Jew". Spinoza influenced discussions of the so-called [[Jewish question]], the examination of the idea of Judaism and the modern, secular Jew. [[Moses Mendelsohn]], Lessing, [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], and [[Emmanuel Kant|Kant]], as well as subsequent thinkers, including [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] were influenced by Spinoza.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=168-69}} The changing conception of Spinoza as "the First Modern Jew" has been explicitly explored by various authors.<ref>Yovel, Yirmiyahu.

In 1886, the young [[George Santayana]] published "The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza", in ''The Harvard Monthly''.<ref>George Santayana, "The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza", ''The Harvard Monthly'', 2 (June 1886: 144–52).</ref> Much later, he wrote an introduction to ''Spinoza's Ethics'' and ''"De Intellectus Emendatione"''.<ref>George Santayana, "Introduction", in ''Spinoza's Ethics and "De intellectus emendatione"''(London: Dent, 1910, vii–xxii)</ref> In 1932, Santayana was invited to present an essay (published as "Ultimate Religion")<ref>George Santayana, "Ultimate Religion", in ''Obiter Scripta'', eds.

In Santayana's autobiography, he characterized Spinoza as his "master and model" in understanding the naturalistic basis of morality.<ref>George Santayana, ''Persons and Places'' (Cambridge, MA and London: MIT Press, 1986), pp. 233–36.</ref>

Philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] evoked Spinoza with the title (suggested to him by [[G. E. Moore]]) of the English translation of his first definitive philosophical work, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', an allusion to Spinoza's ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]''. Elsewhere, Wittgenstein deliberately borrowed the expression ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]'' from Spinoza (''Notebooks, 1914–16'', p.&nbsp;83). The structure of his ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' does have some structural affinities with Spinoza's ''Ethics'' (though, admittedly, not with the Spinoza's ''Tractatus'') in erecting complex philosophical arguments upon basic logical propositions and principles. In propositions 6.4311 and 6.45 he alludes to a Spinozian understanding of eternity and interpretation of the religious concept of eternal life, contending, "If by eternity is understood not eternal temporal duration, but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present." (6.4311) "The contemplation of the world ''sub specie aeterni'' is its contemplation as a limited whole." (6.45)

Spinoza's philosophy played an important role in the development of [[French philosophy|post-war French philosophy]]. Many of these philosophers "used Spinoza to erect a bulwark against the nominally irrationalist tendencies of phenomenology", which was associated with the dominance of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Edmund Husserl]] in France at that time.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Peden |first=Knox |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/880877889 |title=Spinoza contra phenomenology : French rationalism from Cavaillès to Deleuze |date=2014 |isbn=978-0-8047-9136-6 |location=Stanford, California |publisher=Stanford University Press |oclc=880877889}}</ref> [[Louis Althusser]], as well as his colleagues such as [[Étienne Balibar]], saw in Spinoza a philosophy which could lead Marxism out of what they considered to be flaws in its original formulation, particularly its reliance upon Hegel's conception of the [[dialectic]], as well as Spinoza's concept of immanent causality. [[Antonio Negri]], in exile in France for much of this period, also wrote a number of books on Spinoza, most notably ''The Savage Anomaly'' (1981) in his own reconfiguration of Italian [[Autonomia Operaia]]. Other notable French scholars of Spinoza in this period included [[Alexandre Matheron]], [[Martial Gueroult]], [[André Tosel]], and [[Pierre Macherey]], the last of whom published a widely read and influential five-volume commentary on Spinoza's ''Ethics'', which has been described as "a monument of Spinoza commentary".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Baugh |first=Bruce |date=28 March 2015 |title=Spinoza Contra Phenomenology: French Rationalism from Cavaillès to Deleuze |url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/spinoza-contra-phenomenology-french-rationalism-from-cavaills-to-deleuze/ |access-date=2022-05-19 |website=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews |language=en}}</ref> His philosophical accomplishments and moral character prompted [[Gilles Deleuze]] in his doctoral thesis (1968) to name him "the prince of philosophers".<ref>Deleuze, 1968.</ref><ref>Quoted in the translator's preface of Deleuze's ''Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza'' (1990).</ref> Deleuze's interpretation of Spinoza's philosophy was highly influential among French philosophers, especially in restoring to prominence the political dimension of Spinoza's thought.<ref name=":1">{{Citation |last=Rocha |first=Mauricio |title=Spinozist Moments in Deleuze: Materialism as Immanence |date=2021 |url=https://press.ici-berlin.org/doi/10.37050/ci-20/rocha_spinozist-moments-in-deleuze.html |work=Materialism and Politics |pages=73–90 |place=Berlin |publisher=ICI Berlin Press |language=en-GB |doi=10.37050/ci-20_04 |access-date=2022-05-19 |s2cid=234131869|doi-access=free }}.</ref> Deleuze published two books on Spinoza and gave numerous lectures on Spinoza in his capacity as a professor at the [[University of Paris VIII]].

[[Albert Einstein]] named Spinoza as the philosopher who exerted the most influence on his [[world view]] (''Weltanschauung''). Spinoza equated God (infinite substance) with Nature, consistent with Einstein's belief in an impersonal deity. In 1929, Einstein was asked in a telegram by [[Herbert S. Goldstein|Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein]] whether he believed in God. Einstein responded by telegram: "I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings."<ref>{{cite news | title = Einstein believes in "Spinoza's God"; Scientist Defines His Faith in Reply, to Cablegram From Rabbi Here.

[[Leo Strauss]] dedicated his first book, ''Spinoza's Critique of Religion'', to an examination of his ideas. Strauss identified Spinoza as part of the tradition of Enlightenment rationalism that eventually produced Modernity. Moreover, he identifies Spinoza and his works as the beginning of Jewish Modernity.<ref name=tws9912/> More recently [[Jonathan Israel]] argued that, from 1650 to 1750, Spinoza was "the chief challenger of the fundamentals of revealed religion, received ideas, tradition, morality, and what was everywhere regarded, in absolutist and non-absolutist states alike, as divinely constituted political authority."{{sfn|Israel|2001|p=159}}

Spinoza is an important historical figure in the [[Netherlands]], where his portrait was featured prominently on the Dutch 1000-[[Dutch guilder|guilder]] [[banknote]], [[legal tender]] until the euro was introduced in 2002. The highest and most prestigious scientific award of the Netherlands is named the [[Spinoza Prize|''Spinozaprijs'' (Spinoza prize)]].

==Depictions and influence in literature==
Spinoza's life and work have been the subject of interest for several writers. For example, this influence was considerably early in German literature, where [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] makes a glowing mention of the philosopher in his memoirs, highlighting the positive influence of the ''Ethics'' in his personal life.<ref>Johan W. von Goethe. ''[https://archive.org/details/theworksofjohann02goet/page/n14/mode/1up Autobiography]'', vol. 2. Transl. by John Oxenford. The Anthological Society. London-Chicago, 1901, Chapters 14-16, p.178-248 </ref> The same thing happened in the case of his compatriot, the poet [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], who is also lavish in praise for Spinoza on his ''[[Zur Geschichte der Religion und Philosophie in Deutschland|On the History of Religion and Philosophy in Germany]]'' (1834).<ref>Heinrich Heine. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EX4PAQAAIAAJ On the History of Religion and Philosophy in Germany]''. Edited by Paul L. Rose. James Cook University of North Queensland, 1982, p. 56-57 </ref>

In the following century, the Argentinian [[Jorge Luis Borges]] famously wrote two sonnets in his honor ("Spinoza" in ''El otro, el mismo'', 1964; and "Baruch Spinoza" in ''La moneda de hierro'', 1976), and several direct references to Spinoza's philosophy can be found in this writer's work.<ref> Marcelo Abadi: [https://www.borges.pitt.edu/bsol/abadi.php "Spinoza in Borges' looking-glass"].  Borges Studies Online. J. L. Borges Center for Studies & Documentation. Internet: 14/04/01 </ref> Also in Argentina and previously to Borges, the Ukrainian-born Jewish intellectual [[Alberto Gerchunoff]] wrote a novella about philosopher's early sentimental life, ''Los amores de Baruj [sic] Spinoza'' (lit. "The loves of Baruj Spinoza", 1932), recreating a supposed affair or romantic interest with Clara Maria van den Enden, daughter of his Latin teacher and philosophical preceptor, [[Franciscus van den Enden|Franciscus]].<ref>Diego Sztulwark: [https://www.elcohetealaluna.com/spinoza-y-la-cultura-judia-argentina/ "Spinoza y la cultura judía argentina"] (in Spanish). ''El Cohete a la Luna'', 2/6/2022 </ref>

That is not the only work of fiction where the philosopher appears as the main character. In 1837 the German writer [[Berthold Auerbach]] dedicated to him the first novel in his series on Jewish history, translated into English in 1882 (''Spinoza: a Novel'').<ref>See [https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Spinoza:_A_novel complete text] on Wikisource. </ref> Some other novels of biographical nature have appeared more recently, such as ''The Spinoza Problem'' (2012; a parallel story between the philosopher's formative years, and the fascination that his work had on the Nazi leader [[Alfred Rosenberg]]) by psychiatrist [[Irvin D. Yalom]], or ''O Segredo de Espinosa'' (lit. "The Secret of Spinoza", 2023) by Portuguese journalist [[José Rodrigues dos Santos]]. Spinoza also appears in the first novel of the Argentinian activist [[Andres Spokoiny]], ''El impío'' (lit. "The Impious", 2021), about the ''[[marrano]]'' physician and philosopher [[w:es:Juan de Prado|Juan de Prado]], a key influence in Spinoza's biography.<ref>[https://www.enlacejudio.com/2022/05/27/el-impio-de-andres-spokoiny/ El Impío de Andrés Spokoiny] (In Spanish). 05/27/2022. </ref>

Spinoza's ''[[Spinoza's Ethics|Ethics]]'' play a central role in [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]'s short story, ''The Spinoza of Market Street''. The main character, Dr. Nahum Fischelson, studies the book religiously, and holds Spinoza in divine esteem.
