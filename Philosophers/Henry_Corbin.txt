'''Henry Corbin''' (14 April 1903 – 7 October 1978)<REF name="iranica"/> was a French [[philosopher]], [[theologian]], and [[Iranologist]], professor of [[Islamic studies]] at the [[École pratique des hautes études]]. He was influential in extending the modern study of traditional [[Islamic philosophy]] from [[early Islamic philosophy|early ''falsafa'']] to later and "[[Islamic mysticism|mystical]]" figures such as [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi|Suhrawardi]], [[Ibn Arabi]], and [[Mulla Sadra Shirazi]]. With works such as ''Histoire de la philosophie islamique'' (1964), he challenged the common European view that philosophy in the Islamic world declined after [[Averroes]]<REF name="Encyclopedia of Religion"/> and [[Avicenna]].

Born into a [[Protestant]] family in Paris in April 1903,<ref name="iranica" /> Corbin received a [[Catholic]] education, obtaining a certificate in [[Scholastic philosophy]] from the [[Institut Catholique de Paris|Catholic Institute of Paris]] at age 19. Three years later he took his [[Bachelor of Philosophy|"license de philosophie"]] under the [[Thomist]] thinker [[Étienne Gilson]]. He studied modern philosophy, including [[hermeneutics]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], becoming the first French translator of [[Martin Heidegger]]. In 1928, [[Louis Massignon]] (director of Islamic studies at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]) introduced him to Suhrawardi, the 12th-century Persian Muslim thinker. In a late interview, Corbin said: "through my meeting with Suhrawardi, my spiritual destiny ... was sealed. Platonism, expressed in terms of the Zoroastrian [[angelology]] of ancient [[Persia]], illuminated the path that I was seeking."<REF name="Cahiers de l'Herne: Henry Corbin"/><REF name="Philippe Nemo postscript"/> He thus dedicated himself to understanding [[Islam in Iran|Iranian Islam]], which he believed [[esotericism|esoterically]] expressed older [[Perennial philosophy|perennial]] insights related to [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Platonism]]. 

Corbin regularly spent time in [[Iran]], working with [[Shia]] thinkers such as [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabai]] and [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]]. He also became prominent in the European [[Eranos]] circle of scholars initiated by [[Carl Jung]], whose theories (such as the [[collective unconscious]] and [[active imagination]]) he appreciated. Aside from Islamic thought, Corbin wrote on [[Christian mysticism]], especially [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and the [[Holy Grail]].<REF name="AutoFG-1"/> 

==Life and work==
The philosophical life and career of Corbin can be divided into three phases. The first is the 1920s and 1930s, when he was involved in learning and teaching [[western philosophy]]. The second is the years between 1939 and 1946, in which he studied [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] and the [[School of Illumination]] in [[Istanbul]]. The last phase begins in 1946 and lasts until his death, in which he studied and reintroduced [[eastern philosophy|eastern]] and [[Islamic philosophy]].<REF name="AutoFG-2"/>

In 1933 he married [[Stella Leenhardt]]. In 1938, he completed the first translation of one of [[Heidegger]]'s works into French (''Was ist Metaphysik?'', as ''Qu’est-ce que la metaphysique?'').<ref name="iranica" /> In 1939 they traveled to [[Istanbul]], and in 1945 to [[Tehran]]. They returned to [[Paris]] one year later in July 1946. In 1949, Corbin first attended the annual [[Eranos]] Conferences in [[Ascona]], Switzerland. In 1954 he succeeded [[Louis Massignon]] in the Chair of Islam and the Religions of [[Arabia]] at the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris. From the 1950s on he spent autumn in Tehran, winter in Paris and spring in [[Ascona]].

The three major works upon which his reputation largely rests in the [[English speaking world]] were first published in French in the 1950s: ''Avicenna and the Visionary Recital'', ''Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn 'Arabi'' and ''Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth''. His later major work on Central Asian and Iranian [[Sufism]] appears in English with an Introduction by [[Zia Inayat Khan]] as ''The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism''. His [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] is the four volume ''En Islam Iranien: Aspects spirituels et philosophiques''. It has been translated into [[Persian language|Persian]] twice by Dr Enshollah Rahmati and Reza Kuhkan from French (the 4th volume being still untranslated).<REF name="AutoFG-3"/> He died on 7 October 1978.<ref name="iranica" /><REF name="AutoFG-4"/>

==Main themes==
There are several main themes which together form the core of the [[spirituality]] that Corbin defends. The [[Imagination]] is the primary means to engage with Creation. [[Prayer]] is the "supreme act of the creative imagination". He considered himself a [[Protestant]] Christian but he abandoned a [[Christocentric]] view of history. The grand sweep of his [[theology]] of the [[Holy Spirit]] embraces [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. He defended the central role assigned in theology for the individual as the finite image of the Unique [[Divine]].

His [[mysticism]] is no world-denying [[asceticism]] but regards all of Creation as a [[theophany]] of the divine. This vision has much in common with what has become known as [[Creation Spirituality]], and the figure of the [[Angel]] [[Holy Spirit]] is similar to what is sometimes called the [[Omega Point|Cosmic Christ]].<REF name="AutoFG-5"/>

==Legacy and influence==

Corbin's ideas have continued through colleagues, students and others influenced by his work. Especially during his tenure at the [[Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy]] founded in 1974 by [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]]. There he collaborated with western and non-western academics like [[William Chittick]], [[Toshihiko Izutsu]], [[Sayyed Jalal-ed-Din Ashtiani]], [[Abbas Zaryab]], [[Toshio Kuroda (professor)|Toshio Kuroda]] and others.<ref name="IRIP History"/> He also influenced [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]]<ref name="PLW Convo" /><REF name="Association of Friends of Henry and Stella Corbin"/><REF name="PLW influence"/> who studied under Corbin whilst in Iran who would go on to publish reviews on Corbin's work in the first publication of the journal ''Temenos'' by the [[Temenos Academy]] in 1981.<REF name="PLW Temenos1"/><REF name="PLW Temenos 8"/> The journal ''Temenos'' also published English translations of Corbin's work, specifically by [[Peter Russell (poet)|Peter Russell]], Liadain Sherrard, [[Kathleen Raine]] between 1981 and 1992.<REF name="Russell Temenos 1"/><REF name="Sherrard Temenos 4"/><REF name="Sherrard Temenos 8"/><REF name="AutoFG-6"/><REF name="AutoFG-7"/><REF name="AutoFG-8"/> The journal was revived in 1998 as the [[Temenos Academy Review]] and continued to have translations of Corbin's work between 1998 and 2009 by Kathleen Raine and Christine Rhone.<REF name="AutoFG-9"/> Other scholars of [[Sufism]] and [[Islamic thought]] that were influenced by Corbin are [[Christian Jambet]], [[Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi|Ali Amir-Moezzi]], [[Hermann Landolt]], [[Pierre Lory]], [[James Cowan (author)|James Cowan]], James Morris, and Todd Lawson. 

Corbin was an important source for the [[archetypal psychology]] of [[James Hillman]] and others who have developed the [[psychology]] of [[Carl Jung]]. In addition, Corbin was good friends with [[Jacques Lacan]], the French reinterpreter of [[Sigmund Freud]], which gave [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] a familiarity with Islamic thought.<REF name="AutoFG-10"/><REF name="AutoFG-11"/><REF name="AutoFG-12"/><REF name="AutoFG-13"/> According to [[Behrooz Ghamari-Tabrizi]], [[Michel Foucault|Michel Foucault’s]] [[Mystical]] understanding of [[Shia Islam]] which he utilised while reporting on the [[Iranian revolution]] was shaped by the scholarship of [[Louis Massignon]] and Henry Corbin. <REF name="AutoFG-14"/> The American literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] claims Corbin as a significant influence on his own [[concept]]ion of [[Gnosticism]], and the American poet [[Charles Olson]] was a student of Corbin's ''[[Avicenna]] and the [[Visionary]] [[Recital]]''. Corbin's friends and colleagues in France have established L'Association des Amis de Henry et Stella Corbin<REF name="AutoFG-15"/> for the dissemination of his work through meetings and colloquia, and the publication of his posthumous writings.<REF name="AutoFG-16"/><REF name="AutoFG-17"/>

Corbin's work has been criticized by a number of writers, including Steven M. Wasserstrom. Corbin's scholarly objectivity has been questioned on the basis of both a [[Shi'ite]] [[bias]], and his [[theological]] agenda; he has been accused of being both ahistorically [[naive]] and dangerously politically [[reactionary]]; and he has been charged with being both an [[Iranian nationalist]] and an [[elitist]] in both his politics and his [[spirituality]]. Other writers, such as Lory and Subtelny, have written to defend Corbin.<REF name="AutoFG-18"/><REF name="AutoFG-19"/>
