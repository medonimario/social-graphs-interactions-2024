==Biography==
Abdolkarim Soroush was born in [[Tehran]] in 1945. Upon finishing high school, Soroush began studying pharmacy after passing the national entrance exams of Iran. After completing his degree, he soon left Iran for [[London]] in order to continue his studies and become familiar with the Western world.

It was after receiving a master's degree in [[analytical chemistry]] from [[University of London]] that he went to [[Chelsea College of Art and Design|Chelsea College]], (a constituent college of the University of London which was merged with two other constituent colleges: Queen Elizabeth College and Kings College in 1985) for studying history and [[philosophy of science]].{{sfn|Dahlén|loc=chpt. 6|2003}}
After the [[Iranian Revolution|revolution]], Soroush returned to Iran, where he published the book ''Knowledge and Value'' (''Danesh va Arzesh''), the writing of which he had completed in England. He then went to [[Tehran]]'s Teacher Training College where he was appointed the director of the newly established Islamic Culture Group. While in Tehran, Soroush established studies in both history and the philosophy of science.

A year later, all universities were shut down, and a new body was formed by the name of the Cultural Revolution Committee comprising seven members, including Abdulkarim Soroush, all of whom were appointed directly by Ayatollah [[Khomeini]]. Soroush's joining the Cultural Revolution Committee has been criticized on two sides. He has been accused by orthodox critics of preventing the Islamization of human sciences and by the opposition of the Islamic Republic regime of Iran to involvement in the dismissal of teachers.

Soroush rejected the opposition's accusation. There is no independent historical research on Soroush's role in events that led to the Cultural Revolution and also his membership and his role in the Cultural Revolution Committee. He has welcomed such study in his interview with Professor Forough Jahanbakhsh - inquiring into modern Iranian intellectual history.<ref>Jahanbakhsh, Forough, Islam, Democracy and Religious Modernism in Iran, 1953-2000: From Bazargan to Soroush, Brill, 2001, p.145</ref>

In 1983, owing to certain differences which emerged between him and the management of the Teacher Training College, he secured a transfer to the Institute for Cultural Research and Studies where he has been serving as a research member of staff until today. He submitted his resignation from membership in the Cultural Revolution Council to Imam Khomeini and has since held no official position within the ruling system of Iran, except occasionally as an advisor to certain government bodies. His principal position has been that of a researcher at the Institute for Cultural Research and Studies.

During the 1990s, Soroush gradually became more critical of the political role played by the Iranian clergy. The monthly magazine that he cofounded, ''Kiyan'', soon became the most visible forum in post-revolution Iran for religious intellectualism. In this magazine, he published his most controversial articles on religious pluralism, hermeneutics, tolerance, clericalism, etc. The magazine was clamped down in 1998 among many other magazines and newspapers by the direct order of the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic. About a thousand audio tapes of speeches by Soroush on various social, political, religious and literary subjects delivered all over the world are widely in circulation in Iran and elsewhere. Soon, he not only became subject to harassment and state censorship but also lost his job and security. His public lectures at universities in Iran are often disrupted by hardline [[Ansar-e Hezbollah]] vigilante groups who see his intellectual endeavors as being mainly motivated by anti-regime politics rather than theology per se.

Since 2000, Abdulkarim Soroush has been a visiting scholar at [[Harvard University]], teaching Rumi poetry and philosophy, Islam and Democracy, Quranic studies and philosophy of Islamic law. Also a scholar in residence at [[Yale University]], he taught Islamic political philosophy at [[Princeton University]] in the 2002–2003 academic year. From 2003 to 2004 he served as a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin|Wissenschaftkolleg]] in Berlin. He spent the fall semester of 2007 at Columbia University and the spring semester of 2008 at Georgetown University's [[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] as a visiting scholar. In the winter of 2012, he was a visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago]] teaching the intellectual and religious history of modern Iran.

== Philosophy==
Soroush is primarily interested in the philosophy of science, the philosophy of religion, the philosophical system of Molana Jalaleddin Balkhi ([[Rumi]]) and comparative philosophy. He is a world expert on Rumi and Persian Sufi poetry.

The philosophy of Abdolkarim Soroush can be summarized as follows:<ref>[http://www.drsoroush.com/Persian/On_DrSoroush/On_13851013_Paya.html Dr. Soroush<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*Distinction between "religion" and our "understanding of religion".
*Distinction between "essential" and "accidental" aspects of religion.
*Distinction between "minimalist" and "maximalist" interpretation of Islam.
*Distinction between values and morals that are considered internal with respect to Islam and those that are external.
*Distinction between religious "belief" and religious "faith".
*Distinction between religion as an ideology/identity and religion of truth.

===Epistemology===
Soroush's main contribution to Islamic philosophy is his interpretation of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] distinction between ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]'' knowledge. His theory is called "the theoretical contraction and expansion of religious knowledge" and is primarily based on [[Kantianism|Kantian philosophy]]. Soroush maintains that one should distinguish between religion as divinely revealed and the interpretation of religion or religious knowledge which is based on socio-historical factors. The essence of religion is conceived by Soroush as independent from [[experience]] while religious knowledge is understood as a finite, limited, and fallible form of human knowledge, thus depending on [[empirical evidence]].{{sfn|Dahlén|loc=chpt. 7|2003}}

===Religious "belief" and religious "faith"===
Faith cannot be compulsory.  As he told one interviewer, "True believers must embrace the faith of their own free will - not because it was imposed, or inherited, or part of the dominant local culture. To become a believer under pressure or coercion isn't true belief.'"<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Dreams and Shadows: The Future of the Middle East'', Penguin Press, 2008, p.268</ref> This also means that the believer "must&nbsp;... remain free to leave his faith."<ref>[http://www.drsoroush.com/English/On_DrSoroush/E-CMO-19960400-1.html Islam and Liberal Democracy. Two Visions of Reformation], by Robin Wright, ''Journal of Democracy'', 7.2 (1996) 64-75</ref>

At Oxford, Soroush was heavily influenced by Iranian philosopher [[Komeil Sadeghi]], to whom he has dedicated one of his books ''Expansion of Prophetic Experience''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

=== Soroush's political theory ===
Soroush's political theory is in line with the modern tradition from Locke to the framers of the [[American Constitution]]. It portrays human beings as weak and susceptible to temptation, even predation. As such, they need a vigilant and transparent form of government. He believes that the assumption of the innate goodness of mankind, shared by radical utopians from anarchists to Islamic fundamentalists underestimates the staying power of social evil and discounts the necessity of a government of [[checks and balances]] to compensate for the weaknesses of human nature.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060713222849/http://www.kadivar.com/Htm/English/Reviews/reform.htm]

Soroush's political philosophy, as well, remains close to the heart of the liberal tradition, ever championing the basic values of reason, liberty, freedom, and democracy. They are perceived as "primary values," as independent virtues, not handmaidens of political maxims and religious dogma. Soroush entwines these basic values and beliefs in a rich tapestry of Islamic primary sources, literature, and poetry.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060713222849/http://www.kadivar.com/Htm/English/Reviews/reform.htm]

=== Religious democracy ===

Soroush introduced his own definition of the term ''religious democracy'' which is now a topic in contemporary [[Iranian philosophy]] and means that the values of [[religion]] play a role in the public arena in a society populated by religious people. Religious democracy falls within the framework of modern [[rationality]] and has identifiable elements. It is in this way that there are a plurality of democracies in the international community. "Religious democracy" is a subject of intense research in Iranian intellectual circles.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

Given historical circumstances and contingencies, governments may turn out to be primarily democratic or religious. What alters the hue and color of democracy is a society's specific characteristics and elements. The possibility of a democratic religious government also exists and is attainable, but only within the framework of justice and human rights.<ref>Mahmoud Sadri and Ahmad Sadri, eds. Reason, Freedom & Democracy in Islam: Essential Writings of Abdolkarim Soroush. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000, pp. 122-130.</ref> Religious democracy is an example of how democratic values can exist in a different cultural elaboration than what is usually known before.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.humanrights.dk/news/conference_article/ |title=THE DANISH INSTITUTE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS - Aydin: Democracy belongs to us all |access-date=2006-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041025082935/http://www.humanrights.dk/news/conference_article/ |archive-date=2004-10-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But, in a [[secular]] society, some other characteristic is deemed important and focused on, and that becomes the basis for [[democracy]].

In fact relativistic [[liberalism]] and democracy are not identical since democracy is not violated when faith is embraced, it is violated when a particular belief is imposed or disbelief is punished.

We do not have one democracy but many democracies in history. We have a plurality of democracies in the international community. What emerged was that democracy prevailed in different eras depending on the conditions of the time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.drsoroush.com/English/Interviews/E-INT-20031200-1.htm |title=AbdolKarim Soroush :: عبدالکريم سروش<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2006-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915093340/http://drsoroush.com/English/Interviews/E-INT-20031200-1.htm |archive-date=2013-09-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Democracy cannot be derived from or based on intrareligious precepts and adjudications by religious jurists. The combination of religion and democracy ultimately depends on the foundations of human rights, justice, and limitations on power. <ref>Mahmoud Sadri and Ahmad Sadri, eds. Reason, Freedom & Democracy in Islam: Essential Writings of Abdolkarim Soroush. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000, p.131.</ref>

== Reception ==
In 2008, in an online open poll, Soroush was voted the 7th-most intellectual person in the world on the list of Top 100 Public Intellectuals by ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine ([[UK]]) and ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' (United States).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prospect-100-intellectuals/ |title=Intellectuals « Prospect Magazine |access-date=2010-02-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930143349/http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prospect-100-intellectuals/ |archive-date=2009-09-30}}</ref>

Due to Sorush's prominence in the religious intellectual movement, he has been called "the [[Martin Luther|Luther]] of Islam" by the media, a title he disputes as he argues his agenda is fundamentally divergent from that of Martin Luther's.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Meisami|first=Sayeh|date=2013|title='Abdolkarim Soroush|url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195390155/obo-9780195390155-0034.xml|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-12|website=Oxford Bibliographies|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105164410/http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195390155/obo-9780195390155-0034.xml |archive-date=2013-11-05 }}</ref>

=== Criticism and attacks ===
Soroush's "postmodern" ideas on [[epistemology]] and [[hermeneutics]] have been criticized from a "traditional" Shi'i standpoint by the philosopher [[Ayatollah]] [[Abdollah Javadi-Amoli]].{{sfn|Dahlén|loc=chpt. 5b|2003}}

Soroush's ideas have met with strong opposition from conservative elements in the Islamic Republic. Both he and his audiences were assaulted by [[Ansar-e Hezbollah]] vigilantes in the mid-1990s. A law imposing penalties on anyone associating with enemies of the Islamic republic is thought by his allies to have been at least in part provoked by some of Soroush's lectures and foreign affiliations.<ref name=autogenerated1>''The Last Great Revolution'' by Robin Wright c2000, p.57</ref>

According to the journalist [[Robin Wright (author)|Robin Wright]]:
<blockquote>Over the next year, he lost his three senior academic appointments, including a deanship. Other public appearances, including his Thursday lectures, were banned. He was forbidden to publish new articles. He was summoned for several long 'interviews' by Iranian intelligence officials. His travel was restricted, then his passport was confiscated.<ref name=autogenerated1 /></blockquote>

At the celebration of the sixteenth anniversary of the [[Iran hostage crisis|American embassy seizure]] in 1995, Wright found that Iranian [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]] "devoted more time berating Soroush&nbsp;... than condemning the United States or Israel."<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Dreams and Shadows: The Future of the Middle East'', Penguin Press, 2008, p.291-2</ref>

Besides opposition from conservatives, Sourush has also been criticized by secular intellectuals who disapprove of the religious aspects of his ideas and argue that religious intellectualism is a paradoxical ideology.<ref name=":0" />
