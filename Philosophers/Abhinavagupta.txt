Abhinavagupta was born in a [[Kanyakubja Brahmin|Kānyakubja Brāhmin]] family of scholars and mystics whose ancestors immigrated from [[Kannauj]] on invitation by the great king of Kashmir, [[Lalitaditya Muktapida]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7F6Sxu0-50QC |title=Proceedings and Transactions of the ...

Another one of his very important contributions was in the field of philosophy of aesthetics with his famous ''[[Abhinavabharati|Abhinavabhāratī]]'' commentary of ''[[Natya Shastra|Nāṭyaśāstra]]'' of [[Bharata Muni]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, page LXXVII</ref>

==Life==
"Abhinavagupta" was not his real name, rather a title he earned from his Guru, meaing "competence and authoritativeness".<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|20}}<ref>The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir; Navjivan Rastogi, page 157</ref> In his analysis, Jayaratha (1150–1200 AD)<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|92}} – who was Abhinavagupta's most important commentator – also reveals three more meanings: "being ever vigilant", "being present everywhere" and "protected by praises".<ref name="The Kula Ritual">{{cite book|title=The Kula Ritual as Elaborated in Chapter 29 of the Tantrāloka of Abhinavagupta|author=John R. Dupuche}}</ref>{{rp|4}} Raniero Gnoli, the only [[Sanskrit]] scholar who completed a translation of [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]] in a European language, mentions that "Abhinava" also means "new",<ref>Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, 1999, page 3</ref> as a reference to the ever-new creative force of his mystical experience.

From Jayaratha, we learn that Abhinavagupta was in possession of all the six qualities required for the recipients of the tremendous level of [[Shaktipat|śaktipāta]], as described in the sacred texts (Śrīpūrvaśāstra):<ref name="Abhinavagupta, Ganesh Tryambak Deshpande page 19">Abhinavagupta, Ganesh Tryambak Deshpande, page 19</ref> an unflinching faith in God, realisation of [[mantra]]s, control over objective principles (referring to [[the 36 tattvas]]), successful conclusion of all the activities undertaken, poetic creativity and spontaneous knowledge of all disciplines.<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|21}}

Abhinavagupta's creation is well equilibrated between the branches of the triad ([[Trika]]): will (''icchā''), knowledge (''[[Jnana|jñāna]]''), action (''[[Kriya|kriyā]]''); his works also include devotional songs, academical/philosophical works<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|20}} and works describing ritual/yogic practices.<ref>Re-accessing Abhinavagupta, Navjivan Rastogi, page 8</ref>

As an author, he is considered a systematiser of the philosophical thought. He reconstructed, rationalised and orchestrated the philosophical knowledge into a more coherent form,<ref>Re-accessing Abhinavagupta, Navjivan Rastogi, page 10</ref> assessing all the available sources of his time, not unlike a modern scientific researcher.

Various contemporary scholars have characterised Abhinavagupta as a "brilliant scholar and saint",<ref name="Utpaladeva page XXXIII">Īśvara Pratyabhijñā Kārikā of Utpaladeva, Verses on the Recognition of the Lord; B. N. Pandit, page XXXIII</ref> "the pinnacle of the development of Kaśmir Śaivism"<ref name="Utpaladeva page XXXIII" /> and "in possession of yogic realization".<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|20}}

==Social background, family and disciples==

==="Magical" birth===
The term by which Abhinavagupta himself defines his origin is "yoginībhū", 'born of a [[Yogini|yoginī]]'.<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|20}}<ref>Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, page 3</ref> In Kashmir Shaivism and especially in Kaula it is considered that a progeny of parents "established in the divine essence of [[Bhairava]]",<ref>Re-accessing Abhinavagupta, Navjivan Rastogi, page 2</ref> is endowed with exceptional spiritual and intellectual prowess. Such a child is supposed to be "the depository of knowledge", who "even as a child in the womb, has the form of [[Shiva]]",<ref name="The Kula Ritual" /> to enumerate but a few of the classical attributes of his kind.

===Parents===
Abhinavagupta was born in a [[Kanyakubja Brahmin]] family in Kashmir.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7F6Sxu0-50QC |title=Proceedings and Transactions of the ... All-India Oriental Conference |page=48|date=1964 |publisher=Bihar and Orissa Research Society|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rdnrfuOJ6sC&pg=PA188|title=Living Liberation in Hindu Thought|page=188|author1=Andrew O. Fort|author2=Patricia Y. Mumme|publisher=SUNY Press|date=1 January 1996|isbn=9780791427057}}</ref> His mother, ''Vimalā'' (''Vimalakalā'') died when Abhinavagupta was just two years old;<ref name="Tantra, Tantrāloka page 4">Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, page 4</ref><ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|31}} as a consequence of losing his mother, of whom he was reportedly very attached,<ref name="Abhinavagupta, Ganesh Tryambak Deshpande page 19" /> he grew more distant from worldly life and focused all the more on spiritual endeavour.

The father, Narasiṃhgupt, after his wife's death favoured an ascetic lifestyle, while raising his three children. He had a cultivated mind and a heart "outstandingly adorned with devotion to Mahesvara (Shiva)"<ref name="Tantra, Tantrāloka page 4" /> (in Abhinavagupta's own words). He was Abhinavagupta's first teacher, instructing him in [[Sanskrit grammar|grammar]], [[Indian logic|logic]] and [[Sanskrit literature|literature]].<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|30}}

===Family===

Abhinavagupta had a brother and a sister. His brother, Manoratha, was a well-versed devotee of Shiva.<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|22}} His sister, Ambā (probable name, according to Navjivan Rastogi), devoted herself to worship after the death of her husband in late life.

His cousin Karṇa demonstrated even from his youth that he grasped the essence of Śaivism and was detached of the world. His wife was presumably Abhinavagupta's older sister Ambā,<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|24}} who looked with reverence upon her illustrious brother. Ambā and Karṇa had a son, Yogeśvaridatta, who was precociously talented in yoga<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|23}}

Abhinavagupta also mentions his disciple Rāmadeva as faithfully devoted to scriptural study and serving his master.<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|24}} Another cousin was Kṣema, possibly the same as Abhinavagupta's illustrious disciple Kṣemarāja. Mandra, a childhood friend of Karṇa, was their host in a suburban residence; he was not only rich and in possession of a pleasing personality, but also equally learned.<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|25}} And last but not least, Vatasikā, Mandra's aunt, who got a special mention from Abhinavagupta for caring for him with exceptional dedication and concern; to express his gratitude, Abhinavagupta declared that Vatasikā deserved the credit for the successful completion of his work.<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|26}}

The emerging picture here is that Abhinavagupta lived in a nurturing and protected environment, where his creative energies got all the support they required. Everyone around him was filled with spiritual fervor and had taken Abhinavagupta as their spiritual master. Such a supporting group of family and friends was equally necessary as his personal qualities of genius, to complete a work of the magnitude of [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]].

===Ancestors===
By Abhinavagupta's own account, his most remote known ancestor was called Atrigupta, born in antarved [[Kannauj|Kānyakubja]] in [[Madhyadesha]], i.e. the Middle Country. From Madhyadeśa he travelled to [[Kashmir]] at the request of king [[Lalitaditya Muktapida|Lalitāditya]],<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|28}}<ref name="The Kula Ritual" />{{rp|3}} around year 740 CE.<ref name="Triadic Mysticism page 12">Triadic Mysticism, Paul E. Murphy, page 12</ref>

==Masters==
Abhinavagupta is famous for his voracious thirst for knowledge. To study he took many teachers (as many as fifteen),<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|33}} both mystical philosophers and scholars. He approached [[Vaishnavism|Vaiṣṇavas]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Śiddhānta Śaivists]], and the [[Trika]] scholars.

Among the most prominent of his teachers, he enumerates four, two of whom were Vāmanātha, who instructed him in dualistic Śaivism,<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|54}} and Bhūtirāja in the dualist/nondualist school. Besides being the teacher of the famous Abhinavagupta, Bhūtirāja was also the father of two eminent scholars.<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|34}}

Lakṣmaṇagupta, a direct disciple of [[Utpaladeva]], in the lineage of Trayambaka, was highly respected by Abhinavagupta and taught him all the schools of monistic thought: Krama, [[Trika]], and Pratyabhijña (except [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kula]]).<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|54}} Śambhunātha taught him the fourth school (Ardha-trayambaka). This school is in fact Kaula, and it was emanated from Trayambaka's daughter.

For Abhinavagupta, Śambhunātha was the most admired guru. Describing the greatness of his master, he compared Śambhunātha to the Sun, in his power to dispel ignorance from the heart, and, in another place, with "the Moon shining over the ocean of Trika knowledge."<ref name="The Kula Ritual" />{{rp|7}} Abhinavagupta received Kaula initiation through Śambhunātha's wife (acting as a dūtī or [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]]). The energy of this initiation is transmitted and sublimated into the heart and finally into consciousness. Such a method is difficult but very rapid and is reserved for those who shed their mental limitations and are pure. It was Śambhunātha who requested he write [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]]. As guru, he had a profound influence in the structure of [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]]<ref>The Triadic Heart of Śiva, Kaula Tantricism of Abhinavagupta in the Non-Dual Shaivism of Kashmir; Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega, page 1</ref> and in the life of its creator, Abhinavagupta.<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|44–54}}

As many as twelve more of his principal teachers are enumerated by name but without details.<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|35,54}} It is believed that Abhinavagupta had more secondary teachers. Moreover, during his life he had accumulated a large number of texts from which he quoted in his magnum opus, in his desire to create a syncretic, all-inclusive system, where the contrasts of different scriptures could be resolved by integration into a superior perspective.

==Lifestyle==
Abhinavagupta remained unmarried all his life,<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|32}} and as an adept of [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]], at least initially maintained [[brahmacharya]] and supposedly used the vital force of his energy (ojas) to deepen his understanding of the spiritual nervous system he outlined in his works—a system involving ritual union between Purusha (as Shiva) and Shakti. Such union is essentially non-physical and universal, and thus Abhinavagupta conceived himself as always in communion with Shiva-Shakti. In the context of his life and teachings, Abhinavagupta parallels Shiva as both ascetic and enjoyer.

Abhinavagupta studied assiduously at least until the age of thirty or thirty-five.<ref name="Triadic Mysticism page 12" /> To accomplish that he travelled, mostly inside Kashmir.<ref name="The Kula Ritual" />{{rp|6}} By his own testimony, he had attained spiritual liberation through his Kaula practice, under the guidance of his most admired master, Śambhunātha.<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|44–54}} He lived in his home (functioning as an [[ashram]]) with his family members and disciples,<ref>Īśvara Pratyabhijñā Kārikā of Utpaladeva, Verses on the Recognition of the Lord; B. N. Pandit, page XXXIV</ref> and he did not become a wandering monk, nor did he take on the regular duties of his family, but lived out his life as a writer and a teacher.<ref name="The Kula Ritual" />{{rp|7}} Abhinavagupta's personality was described as a living realisation of his vision.<ref name="Re-accessing Abhinavagupta page 4" />

In an epoch pen-painting, Abhinavagupta is depicted seated in Virasana, surrounded by devoted disciples and family, performing a kind of trance-inducing music on a [[veena]] while dictating verses of [[Tantrāloka]] to one of his attendees--behind him two dūtī (women [[yogi]]) waiting on him. A legend about the moment of his death (placed somewhere between 1015 and 1025, depending on the source), says that he took with him 1,200 disciples and marched off to a cave, today this cave is known by (Abhinavagupta Cave) located at hill called Bairam at [[Beerwah, Jammu and Kashmir | Beerwah]], reciting his poem ''Bhairava-stava'', a devotional work. They were never to be seen again, supposedly translating together into the spiritual world.<ref>Triadic Mysticism, Paul E. Murphy, page 13</ref>

==Works==

{{Hinduism}}
Abhinavagupta's works fall into multiple sections: manuals of religious ritual, devotional songs, philosophical works and philosophy of aesthetics. Here are enumerated most of his works.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Bold type faced titles represent the most important ones.

===Religious works===

====Tantraloka====
{{main|Tantraloka}}
His most important work was ''Tantrāloka'' ("Elucidation of Tantra"), a synthesis of the entire Trika system.<ref name="Introduction" />{{rp|20}} The esoteric chapter 29 on the Kaula ritual was translated in English together with ''Jayaratha'''s commentary by John R. Dupuche.<ref name="The Kula Ritual" />{{rp|4}} A complex study on the context, authors, contents and references of ''Tantrāloka'' was published by Navjivan Rastogi, Prof. of the Lucknow University.<ref name="Introduction" /> Though there are no English translations of ''Tantrāloka'' to date, the last recognized master of the oral tradition of Kashmir Shaivism, [[Swami Lakshman Joo]], gave a condensed version of the key philosophical chapters of ''Tantrāloka'' in his book, ''Kashmir Shaivism – The Secret Supreme''.<ref>Kashmir Shaivism – ''The Secret Supreme'', ed, John Hughes, SUNY press, 1985.</ref>

Another important text was the commentary on Parātrīśikā, ''Parātrīśikāvivaraṇa'', detailing the signification of the phonematic energies and their two sequential ordering systems, Mātṛkā and Mālinī. This was the last major translation project of [[Jaideva Singh]].<ref>Para-trisika-Vivarana, Jaideva Singh</ref>

====Tantrasara====
{{main|Tantrasara}}
Tantrasāra ("Essence of Tantra") is a summarised version, in prose, of ''Tantrāloka'', which was once more summarised in ''Tantroccaya'', and finally presented in a very short summary form under the name of ''Tantravaṭadhānikā'' – the "Seed of Tantra".

''Pūrvapañcikā'' was a commentary of ''Pūrvatantra'', alias Mālinīvijaya Tantra, lost to this day. ''Mālinīvijayā-varttika'' ("Commentary on Mālinīvijaya") is a versified commentary on ''Mālinīvijaya Tantra'''s first verse. ''Kramakeli'', "Krama's Play" was a commentary of ''Kramastotra'', now lost. ''Bhagavadgītārtha-saṃgraha'' which translates "Commentary on [[Bhagavad Gita]]" has now an English translation by Boris Marjanovic.<ref>Abhinavagupta's Commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Boris Marjanovic</ref>

Other religious works are: ''Parātrīśikā-laghuvṛtti'', "A Short Commentary on Parātrīśikā", ''Paryantapañcāśīkā'' ("Fifty Verses on the Ultimate Reality"), ''Rahasyapañcadaśikā'' ("Fifteen Verses on the Mystical Doctrine"), ''Laghvī prakriyā'' ("Short Ceremony"), ''Devīstotravivaraṇa'' ("Commentary on the Hymn to Devi") and ''Paramārthasāra'' ("Essence of the Supreme Reality").

=== Devotional hymns ===
Abhinavagupta has composed a number of devotional poems, most of which have been translated into French by [[Lilian Silburn]]:<ref>Hymnes de Abhinavagupta: Traduits et commentés, Lilian Silburn</ref>

* ''Bodhapañcadaśikā'' – "Fifteen Verses on Consciousness";
* ''Paramārthacarcā'' – "Discussion on the Supreme Reality";
* ''Anubhavanivedana'' – "Tribute of the Inner Experience";
* ''Anuttarāṣṭikā'' – "Eight Verses on Anuttara";
* ''Krama-stotra'' – an hymn, different from the fundamental text of the Krama school;
* ''Bhairava-stava'' – "Hymn to [[Bhairava]]";
* ''Dehasthadevatācakra-stotra'' – "Hymn to the Wheel of Divinities that Live in the Body";
* ''Paramārthadvādaśikā'' – "Twelve Verses on the Supreme Reality" and
* ''Mahopadeśa-viṃśatikā'' – "Twenty Verses on the Great Teaching".
* Another poem ''Śivaśaktyavinābhāva-stotra'' – "Hymn on the Inseparability of [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]]" was lost.

===Philosophical works===
One of the most important works of Abhinavagupta is ''Īśvarapratyabhijñā-vimarśini'' ("Commentary to the Verses on the Recognition of the Lord") and ''Īśvarapratyabhijñā-vivṛti-vimarśini'' ("Commentary on the explanation of ''Īśvarapratyabhijñā''"). This treatise is fundamental in the transmission of the ''Pratyabhijña'' school (the branch of Kashmir Shaivism based on direct recognition of the Lord) to our days. Another commentary on a ''Pratyabhijña'' work – ''Śivadṛṣtyā-locana'' ("Light on Śivadṛṣṭi") – is now lost. Another lost commentary is ''Padārthapraveśa-nirṇaya-ṭīkā'' and ''Prakīrṇkavivaraṇa'' ("Comment on the Notebook") referring to the third chapter of ''Vākyapadīya'' of [[Bhartrihari]]. Two more philosophical texts of Abhinavagupta are ''Kathāmukha-tilaka'' ("Ornament of the Face of Discourses") and ''Bhedavāda-vidāraṇa'' ("Confrontation of the Dualist Thesis").

===Poetical and dramatic works===
{{main|Abhinavabharati}}
''Abhinavagupta''s most important work on the philosophy of art is ''Abhinavabhāratī'' – a long and complex commentary on [[Natya Shastra]] of [[Bharata Muni]]. This work has been one of the most important factors contributing to Abhinavagupta's fame up until present day. His most important contribution was that to the theory of [[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]] (aesthetic savour).

Other poetical works include: ''Ghaṭa-karpara-kulaka-vivṛti'', a commentary on "Ghaṭakarpara" of [[Kalidasa]]; ''Kāvyakauṭukavivaraṇa'', a "Commentary to the Wonder of Poetry" (a work of Bhaṭṭa Tauta), now lost; and ''Dhvanyālokalocana'', "Illustration of Dhvanyāloka", which is a famous work of [[Anandavardhana]].
