'''Paul Carus''' ({{IPA|de|paʊl ˈkaːʁʊs|lang}}; 18 July 1852 – 11 February 1919) was a [[German-American]] author, editor, a student of [[comparative religion]]<ref name="Dictionary">[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist3.xml;chunk.id=dv3-53 Oriental Ideas in American Thought], from ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Studies of Selected Pivotal Ideas'', edited by Philip P. Wiener (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1973–74).</ref> and [[philosopher]].<ref>William H. Hay, "Paul Carus: A Case-Study of Philosophy on the Frontier", in ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 17 (1956), 498–510.</ref>

==Life and education==

Carus was born in [[Ilsenburg]], [[German Confederation|Germany]], and educated at the universities of [[University of Strasbourg|Strassburg]] (then Germany, now France) and [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], Germany. After obtaining his PhD from Tübingen in 1876<ref name="Monist">[http://www.nlx.com/Journals/mst.htm The Monist:An International Quarterly Journal of General Philosophical Inquiry], featuring essays from scholars around the globe.</ref> he served in the army and then taught school. He had been raised in a pious and orthodox [[Protestantism|Protestant]] home, but gradually moved away from this tradition.<ref name="Encounter">[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0807849065/ The American Encounter with Buddhism, 1844–1912: Victorian Culture and the Limits of Dissent], by Thomas A. Tweed (Paperback), page 65-67</ref>

He left [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] for the United States, "because of his liberal views".<ref name="OpenCourt">{{cite web|url=http://www.opencourtbooks.com/about.htm|title=Open Court: About Us|website=opencourtbooks.com}}</ref> After he emigrated to the USA (in 1884) he lived in Chicago, and in [[LaSalle, Illinois]]. Paul Carus married [[Edward C. Hegeler]]'s daughter, engineer [[Mary Hegeler Carus|Mary Hegeler]] (Marie) and the couple later moved into the [[Hegeler Carus Mansion]], built by her father. They had seven children, the firstborn, Robert died at birth, but Edward (b. 1890), Gustave (b. 1892), Paula (b. 1894), Elisabeth or "Libby" (b. 1896), Herman (b. 1899), and Alwin (b. 1901) all lived long lives.<ref name="Foundation">[http://www.hegelercarus.org/history/ History of the Heleger Carus Foundation – The Hegeler Carus Mansion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090315/http://www.hegelercarus.org/history/ |date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> Mary ran the family business, [[Matthiessen and Hegeler Zinc Company|Matthiessen-Hegeler Zinc Company]] and the [[Open Court Publishing Company|Open Court]] business and later took on the editorial role after Carus' death, alongside their daughter Elizabeth.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Advancing Research with the Open Court · The Life of Mary Hegeler Carus · SCRC Virtual Museum at Southern Illinois University's Morris Library|url=https://scrcexhibits.omeka.net/exhibits/show/mary-hegeler-carus/editor-of-the-open-court-publi|access-date=2021-03-19|website=scrcexhibits.omeka.net}}</ref>

==Career==
In the United States, Carus briefly edited a German-language journal and wrote several articles for the ''Index'', the [[Free Religious Association]] organ.<ref name="Dictionary"/>

Soon after, he became the first managing editor of the [[Open Court Publishing Company]], founded in 1887 by his father-in-law.<ref name="OpenCourt"/> The goals of Open Court were to provide a forum for the discussion of philosophy, [[science]], and religion, and to make philosophical classics widely available by making them affordable.<ref name="Foundation"/>

He also acted as the editor for two periodicals published by the company, ''The Open Court'' and ''[[The Monist]]''.<ref name="Monist"/><ref>[[Andreas Daum]],“'The Next Great Task of Civilization': International Exchange in Popular Science. The German-American Case, 1850–1900", in ''The Mechanics of Internationalism: Culture, Society, and Politics 1850–1914''. Oxford University Press, 2001, 309–11, 314, 317.</ref>

He was introduced to [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Poverty|Charles Sanders Peirce]], the founder of [[American Pragmatism]], by Judge Francis C. Russell of Chicago. Carus stayed abreast of Peirce's work and would eventually publish a number of his articles.<ref>[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/shaw2.htm William James and Yogaacaara philosophy: A comparative inquiry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926212728/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/shaw2.htm |date=26 September 2011 }}, by Miranda Shaw, (University of Hawaii Press, 1987), page 241, note 4</ref>

During his lifetime, Carus published 75 books and 1500 articles,<ref name="Foundation2">[http://www.hegelercarus.org/history/ History of the Heleger Carus Foundation – Open Court Publishing Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090315/http://www.hegelercarus.org/history/ |date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> mostly through Open Court Publishing Company. He wrote books and articles on history, politics, philosophy, religion, logic, mathematics, anthropology, science, and social issues of his day. In addition, Carus corresponded with many of the greatest minds of the late 19th and early 20th century, sending and receiving letters from [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Booker T. Washington]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], [[John Dewey]], and many more.

==Carus's world view and philosophy==
Carus considered himself a [[theologian]] rather than philosopher. He referred to himself as "an [[Atheism|atheist]] who loved God".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BSq2XL-61G8C&dq=%22an+atheist+who+loved+god%22&pg=PA26 The Gospel of Buddha], by Paul Carus, page 26</ref><ref name="Radical">[http://www.radicalacademy.com/amphilosophy8.htm#carus Recent American Thought] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302041231/http://www.radicalacademy.com/amphilosophy8.htm |date=2 March 2008 }}, from [http://radicalacademy.com/adiphildirectory.htm The Radical Academy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330071602/http://radicalacademy.com/adiphildirectory.htm |date=30 March 2008 }}</ref>

Carus is proposed to be a pioneer in the promotion of [[Interfaith dialogue|interfaith]] dialogue. He explored the relationship of science and religion, and was instrumental in introducing Eastern traditions and ideas to the West.<ref name="OpenCourt"/> He was a key figure in the introduction of [[Buddhism]] to the West,<ref name="Encounter"/> sponsoring Buddhist translation work of [[D.T. Suzuki]], and fostering a lifelong working friendship with Buddhist Master, [[Soyen Shaku]]. Carus' interest in Asian religions seems to have intensified after he attended the [[Parliament of the World's Religions|World's Parliament of Religions]] (in 1893).

For years afterwards, Carus was a strong sympathizer of Buddhist ideas, but stopped short of committing fully to this, or any other, religion. Instead, he ceaselessly promoted his own rational concept which he called the "Religion of Science." Carus had a selective approach and he believed that religions evolve over time. After a battle for survival, he expected a "cosmic religion of universal truth" to emerge from the ashes of traditional beliefs.<ref name="Encounter"/>

Carus proposed his own philosophy similar to [[panpsychism]] known as 'panbiotism', which he defined as "everything is fraught with life; it contains life; it has the ability to live."<ref>[[David Skrbina|Skrbina, David]]. (2005). ''Panpsychism in the West''. MIT Press. p. 149. {{ISBN|0-262-19522-4}}

===Religion of Science===
Carus was a follower of [[Benedictus de Spinoza]]; he was of the opinion that Western thought had fallen into error early in its development in accepting the distinctions between body and mind and the material and the spiritual. (Kant's [[Phenomenon#Philosophical usage|phenomenal]] and [[noumenal]] realms of knowledge; Christianity's views of the [[soul]] and the [[Human body|body]], and the [[natural]] and the [[supernatural]]). Carus rejected such dualisms, and wanted science to reestablish the unity of knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Meyer, Donald Harvey|title=Paul Carus and the Religion of Science|journal=[[American Quarterly]]|date=Winter 1962|volume=14|issue=4|pages=597–607|doi=10.2307/2710135|jstor=2710135}}</ref> The philosophical result he labeled ''[[Monism]]''.<ref name="Dictionary"/>

His version of ''monism'' is more closely associated with a kind of [[pantheism]], although it was occasionally identified with [[positivism]].<ref name="Radical"/> He regarded every [[Physical law|law of nature]] as a part of God's being. Carus held that God was the name for a ''cosmic order'' comprising "all that which is the bread of our spiritual life." He held the concept of a [[personal God]] as untenable. He acknowledged [[Jesus]] Christ as a redeemer, but not as the only one, for he believed that other religious founders were equally endowed with similar qualities.<ref name="Radical"/>

His beliefs attempted to steer a middle course between idealistic [[metaphysics]] and [[materialism]]. He differed with metaphysicians because they "[[wiktionary:reify#Verb|reified]]" words and treated them as if they were realities, and he objected to materialism because it ignored or overlooked the importance of form. Carus emphasized form by conceiving of the divinity as a cosmic order. He objected to any monism which sought the unity of the world, not in the unity of truth, but in the oneness of a logical assumption of ideas. He referred to such concepts as ''henism'', not monism.<ref name="Radical"/>

Carus held that [[truth]] was independent of time, human desire, and human [[Action (philosophy)|action]]. Therefore, science was not a human invention, but a human [[revelation]] which needed to be apprehended; discovery meant apprehension; it was the result or manifestation of the cosmic order in which all truths were ultimately harmonious.<ref name="Radical"/>

===Criticisms of Carus' ideas===
It is claimed that Carus was dismissed by [[Orientalism|Orientalists]] and philosophers alike because of his failure to comply with the rules of either discipline.<ref>[https://tricycle.org/magazine/future-of-religion-review Future Religion – Making an American Buddha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110232201/http://www.tricycle.com/reviews/future-religion |date=10 November 2013 }}, by Judith Snodgrass.

==Legacy==
The legacy of Paul Carus is honored through the efforts of the ''Hegeler Carus Foundation'', the ''[[Carus Lectures]]'' at the ''[[American Philosophical Association]] (APA)'', and the ''Paul Carus Award for Interreligious Understanding''<ref>[http://www.cpwr.org/what/programs/carusaward.htm The Paul Carus Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Interreligious Movement]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616195300/http://www.cpwr.org/what/programs/carusaward.htm |date=16 June 2006 }}.
