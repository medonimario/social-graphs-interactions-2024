'''Samuel Bolde''' (1649â€“1737) was an [[English people|English]] clergyman and controversialist, a supporter of the arguments of [[John Locke]] for [[religious toleration]].

==Life==
Apparently a native of [[Chester]], he was brought up by William Cook, a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] minister  ejected from St. Michael's Church, Chester, in 1662, who died in 1684. Bolde was instituted vicar of [[Shapwick, Dorset|Shapwick in Dorset]] in 1674, but resigned or was ejected in 1688; he was instituted rector of [[Steeple, Dorset|Steeple]] in the [[Isle of Purbeck]] in 1682, and held the living until his death. In 1721 he succeeded to the adjacent parish of [[Tyneham]], united to Steeple by act of parliament.<ref name = DNB>''Dictionary of National Biography''; [[:s:Bold, Samuel (DNB00)]].</ref>

In 1682, when a brief for the persecuted [[Huguenot]]s was to be read in church, Bolde preached a sermon against persecution and published it with [[Awnsham Churchill]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=2830|title=Bond, Nathaniel|first=John|last=Ferris}}</ref> With a second edition in the same year, it raised a great outcry; Bolde then published a ''Plea for Moderation towards Dissenters.'' He justified his general praise of nonconformists, mentioning amongst others [[Richard Baxter]] and [[Henry Hickman]] as "shining lights in the church of God". In 1720 Bolde republished the sermon against persecution, adding a short account of his subsequent troubles.<ref name = DNB/>

The [[grand jury]] at the next [[assize]] presented Bold for the sermon and also for the ''Plea'', and he was cited before the court of [[William Gulston]], [[Bishop of Bristol]], where he was accused of having "writ and preached a scandalous libel". Bolde wrote answers to these charges, but he was commanded, on pain of suspension, to preach three recantation sermons. Meanwhile, in the civil courts, a further offence was there alleged against him that he had written a letter befriending a dissenting apothecary in [[Blandford]]. For the letter and the two publications he was sentenced to pay three fines, and Bolde was seven weeks in prison before they were paid. After this the death of the bishop and of the promoter in the civil suit freed him from further annoyance.<ref name = DNB/>

==Works==
In 1688 he published ''A Brief Account of the Rise of the name Protestant, and what Protestantism is. By a professed Enemy to Persecution.'' In 1690 he engaged in a controversy with [[Thomas Comber (dean of Durham)|Thomas Comber]], author of a ''Scholastical History of the Primitive and General Use of Liturgies in the Christian Church'', which Bolde perceived to be written to afford a pretext for persecuting dissent; in 1691 he followed it up with a second tract.<ref name = DNB/>

In 1697 he began his tracts in support of Locke's ''Reasonableness of Christianity'' and  ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. The ''Reasonableness of Christianity'' had appeared in 1695, and was attacked by Rev. [[John Edwards (1637-1716)|John Edwards]] as a [[Socinian]]. Locke replied with a ''Vindication'' of his essay, to which Edwards answered in ''Socinianism Unmasked''. At this point Bold entered the field, publishing in 1697 a ''Discourse on the true Knowledge of Christ Jesus'', in which he insists, with Locke, that Christ and the apostles considered it enough for a Christian to believe that Jesus was the Christ. To the sermon he appended comments on Locke's essay and ''Vindication'', declaring the essay 'one of the best books that had been published for at least 1,600 years,' and criticising Edwards's tracts. Edwards immediately retorted, and produced a second tract from Bolde with a preface on the meaning of the terms "reason" and "antiquity" as employed in the [[Socinian controversy]]. This was in 1697; in 1698 a third tract of Bolde's appeared, answering some ''Animadversions'', published at Oxford. In 1699 he brought out a ''Consideration of the Objections to the Essay on the Human Understanding.'' Locke acknowledged Bolde's support in his 'Second Vindication' of his essay; and in 1703 Bold visited Locke at [[Oates, Essex]]. He was then meditating the publication of further tracts which Locke dissuaded him from proceeding with. They were, however, published in 1706, and consist of a ''Discourse concerning the Resurrection of the Same Body'' and two letters on the necessary immateriality of created thinking substance. The letters discuss and condemn the views expressed in [[John Broughton (clergyman)|John Broughton]]'s ''Psychologia'' and [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]]'s ''Essay towards the Theory of an Ideal World.'' The discourse deals with [[Daniel Whitby]]'s arguments against Locke.<ref name = DNB/>

In 1717 Bolde's publisher brought out another tract demanding toleration;<ref>''The Duty of Christians with regard to Human Interpretations and Decisions, when proposed to be believed and submitted to by them, as necessary parts of the Christian Religion. By a Clergyman in the country;''</ref> and in 1724 appeared his last controversial work, ''Some Thoughts concerning Church Authority.'' This was occasioned by [[Benjamin Hoadley]]'s launching of the [[Bangorian Controversy]], with a sermon on the nature of the kingdom of Christ, and his ''Preservative against the Principles and Practices of Nonjurors'', of which Bolde approved. Bolde was answered by several persons, among others by [[Conyers Place]], who condemned him as full of "stupid and affected cant".<ref name = DNB/>

In 1693 he published a devotional treatise entitled ''Christ's Importunity with Sinners to accept of Him,'' which had been probably already published in 1675. The republication contains an affectionate dedication to Mrs. Mary Cook, the widow of William Cook, his early tutor. In 1696, an epidemic having caused many deaths in his parish, he published eight ''Meditations on Death written during the leisure bodily distempers have afforded me.''
In the year before his death Bolde published a ''Help to Devotion'' containing a short prayer on every chapter in the New Testament.<ref name = DNB/>
