'''Erwin Rohde''' ({{IPA|de|ˈʀoːdə|lang}}; 9 October 1845 &ndash; 11 January 1898) was one of the great [[Germany|German]] classical scholars of the 19th century.

Rohde was born in [[Hamburg]] and was the son of a doctor. Outside of antiquarian circles, Rohde is known today chiefly for his friendship and correspondence with fellow philologist [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The two were students together in [[Bonn]] and [[Leipzig]], where they were studying [[philology]] taught by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl]]. In 1872, Rohde became a professor at the [[University of Kiel]]. He later was professor in [[Jena]] (1876), [[Tübingen]] (1878) and finally [[Heidelberg]], where he died in 1898 after suffering from a gradual decline in health.

His ''Psyche'' (1890-1894) remains a standard reference work for [[Greek mythology|Greek]] cult practices and beliefs related to the [[soul]].

His work, ''Der Griechische Roman und seine Vorläufer'' (1876), was considered by [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] to be "the best book on the history of the [[Novel#World wide view|ancient novel]]", and it is still regarded as one of the greatest "monuments of 19th century classics scholarship in Germany".<ref>Bakhtin, M.
