'''Sengzhao''' (or '''Seng-Chao''') ({{zh|c=僧肇|p=Sēngzhào|w=Seng-chao|l=}}; {{langx|ja|僧肇}}, ''Sōjō''; 384–414)<ref>Chan, Wing-tsit (translated and compiled). ''A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1963: 343.</ref>
was a [[List of Chinese philosophers|Chinese]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosopher from [[Later Qin]]. Born to a poor family in [[Jingzhao]], he acquired literary skills, apparently including the capacity to read [[Pali]], and became a scribe. This exposed him to a variety of uncommon documents. He was influenced by [[Taoism|Taoists]], [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]],<ref>Chan, Wing-tsit (translated and compiled). ''A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy''.

This encounter transformed his life and he became a Buddhist. He was known as being among the ablest of the disciples of [[Kumārajīva]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Gateless Barrier: Zen Comments on the Mummonkon.|last=Shibayama|first=Zenkei|publisher=Shambhala|year=2000|isbn=1-57062-726-6|pages=176–177}}</ref>

Sengzhao was recognized as both a scholar of high skill and someone of profound understanding relating to religious matters. He was involved in translating Indian [[treatises]], which formed the only source of study for early Chinese [[Mādhyamika]] Buddhism. He also authored a small number of texts, but is famous for the book ''Zhaolun''. Its chapters are as follows: ''Things Do Not Shift'', ''Non-Absolute Emptiness'', ''Prajna Is Without Dichotomizing Knowledge'', and ''Nirvana Is Without Conceptualization''.<ref>Alternative renderings of section titles: 物不遷:"Objects Do Not Move" (T45n1858_p0151a08); 不真空:"Unreal Emptiness" (T45n1858_p0152a0); 般若無知: "Wisdom (Prajna) Has No Knowing" (T45n1858_p0153a07): and 涅槃無名: "Nirvana Has No Name" (T45n1858_p0157a12)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/sengzhao/|title=Sengzhao (Seng-Chao) {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref>

He is mentioned in the ''[[Memoirs of Eminent Monks]]''.

Sengzhao criticized earlier Chinese Buddhist schools for believing in being or non-being. He concluded that all [[dharma]]s are empty.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

He composed a series of treatises published under the title ''Chao Lun'' or ''Zhao Lun'', which was first translated (1948) into English as ''The Book of Chao'' <ref>''The book of Chao;: A translation from the original Chinese with introduction, notes and appendices'', Monumenta Serica. Journal of Oriental Studies of the Catholic University of Peking, 1948.</ref> by [[Walter Liebenthal]], and later (1968) republished in a revised edition with the revised title of ''Chao Lun, the Treatises of Seng-chao''. .<ref>Liebenthal, Walter (translated),  ''Chao lun; the treatises of Sengzhao. A translation with introduction, notes, and appendices, 2nd edition''. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press; sold by the Oxford University Press, New York, 1968.</ref> A partial translation of many of his treatises can be found in [[Richard Robinson (Buddhism scholar)|Richard H. Robinson]]'s ''Early Mādhyamika in India and China.''<ref>Robinson, Richard H. "Early Mādhyamika in India and China." (1967).</ref>

==Later References==
A number of other accounts exist concerning the life of Sengzhao, though they rarely shed any new light on his work or activities. The Weishou [a collection of canonical texts] accords Sengzhao preeminence among the eight hundred or so scholars gathered at Chang’an: “Daorong and his fellows were of knowledge and learning all-pervasive, and Sengzhao was the greatest of them. When Kumrajva made a translation, Sengzhao would always take pen in hand and define the meanings of words. He annotated the Vimalakrtinirdesha Stra and also published several treatises. They all have subtle meaning, and scholars venerate them.” (Hurvitz 54)

While adding nothing substantively new, this version highlights Sengzhao's importance as a liaison between the Indian [[Kumarajiva]] and the Chinese language. All indications point to the foreign master's reliance on Sengzhao's ability to “translate” the Indian terminology into stylistically acceptable Chinese. The [[Koan|gong’an]] (meditation puzzle) collection known as the Biyen lu ([[Blue Cliff Record]]) contains a tale concerning Sengzhao's death which by all accounts is apocryphal. Despite its spurious legend regarding Zhao's demise, within the gongan commentary supplied by the Chan (“meditation”; Japanese Zen) master Yunmen, we find another reference to his life that provides some insight into his correspondence with Liu Yimin. According to the Biyen lu, Sengzhao not only took Kumrajva as his teacher, but “he also called upon the bodhisattva Buddhabhadra at the Temple of the Tile Coffin, who had come from India to transmit the mind-seal of the twenty-seventh Patriarch. Sengzhao then entered deeply into the inner sanctum.” (Cleary, Thomas, and J.C. Cleary, trans. The Blue Cliff Records. Boulder, CO: Shambala, 1978.)"
