'''Lucrezia Marinella''' (1571-1653) was a poet, author, philosopher, polemicist, and women's rights advocate from the [[Republic of Venice]]. She is best known for her polemical treatise ''The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men'' (1600).<ref name="SEP">{{Cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lucrezia-marinella/ |title=Lucrezia Marinella (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |access-date=8 February 2023 |last=Deslauriers |first=Marguerite}}</ref> Her works have been noted for bringing women into the philosophical and scientific community during the late Renaissance.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Ray |first=Meredith K. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/905902839 |title=Daughters of alchemy : women and scientific culture in early modern Italy |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-674-42587-3 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |oclc=905902839}}</ref>

==Life ==

Lucrezia Marinella was the daughter of a physician and natural philosopher, Giovanni Marinelli, who wrote novels, some of which were on women’s well-being, hygiene and beauty.<ref name="Marinella, Lucrezia 1999. pg.3">Marinella, Lucrezia, and Anne Dunhill. 1999.

Marinella also had a close relationship with Giovanni Nicoló Doglioni who was one of the founders of the Venetian academy. She was supported by her peers and influential in the formation of the 'new' Venetian academy because of her powerful writing style and insight into women's rights.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal |last=Kolsky |first=Stephen |date=2001 |title=Moderata Fonte, Lucrezia Marinella, Giuseppe Passi: An Early Seventeenth-Century Feminist Controversy |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3735864 |journal=The Modern Language Review |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=973–989 |doi=10.2307/3735864 |jstor=3735864 |s2cid=162224637 |issn=0026-7937}}</ref> Marinella helped other female writers to continue publishing their writings, which was very rare for women in this period because of countless restrictions. Female writers began to dispute claims made by other male writers, like Giuseppe Passi, that showcased their intelligence and rhetorical writing skills. Unlike other academies, women were allowed to criticize and negate prejudice about female inferiority, but also had institutional support from some male professors and fellow peers.<ref>{{Cite book |first=S |last=Kolsky |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1315722370 |title=Moderata Fonte, Lucrezia Marinella, Giuseppe Passi: An early seventeenth-century feminist controversy |date=2001-10-01 |publisher=MANEY PUBLISHING |oclc=1315722370}}</ref>

In this era, many women entered convents or became courtesans (like the famous [[Veronica Franco]]). Entering a convent meant that a woman was not obligated to be married and could pursue education and spiritual development. But, at the same time the [[Roman Catholic Church]] maintained rigid theories of gender and expectations of women’s place and nature. However, Lucrezia Marinella did not enter the convent and wasn't pressured into marriage. She came from a professional family that very much encouraged her studies, and her father was extremely supportive.<ref>Marinella, Lucrezia, and Anne Dunhill. 1999. ''The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.(pg. 1)</ref> Although, Marinella received support from her peers to delay marriage and further her education she still had many barriers preventing her from writing.

Although Lucrezia’s writing brought her fame, she lived her life in seclusion. It is believed that Lucrezia's solitary life is what allowed her to write so much so soon. But a life of seclusion was typical for women of her social rank in sixteenth-century Italy.  She did not travel, except to local shrines, there is no evidence she gathered with other authors for discussions, and there is no record of her even attending meetings held in academies outside. {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

==Women in the Late Middle Ages and Early Renaissance==

Women’s rights and the equality of women were a major focus of Marinella's writings. In the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance era in Italy, women were largely wives and mothers. Many women who wanted to pursue knowledge either had to be of elite standing, enter convents, or become courtesans. Women were normally not a part of political conversations and had to be extraordinary to be fully recognized in literature. {{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Marinella talks in her writings about the tradition of female inequality that has persisted throughout Western culture and is rooted in Hebrew, Greek, Roman, and Christian ideals.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book |first=Colonna |last=Vittoria |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/748360621 |title=Who Is Mary? : Three Early Modern Women On The Idea Of The Virgin Mary. |date=2010 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-1-282-67900-9 |oclc=748360621}}</ref>

Although Marinella was one of the best recognized female writers of the time, which included [[Moderata Fonte]], [[Arcangela Tarabotti]] and [[Veronica Franco]]. Marinella’s works mostly dealt with women’s rights and she even asserted that women were superior to men, which was a popular argument in that time for polemical and philosophical works.<ref name="SEP"/> She does so through her work, ''La nobiltà et l'eccellenza delle donne co' diffetti et mancamenti de gli uomini.''<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Kolsky |first=Stephen |title=Moderata Fonte, Lucrezia Marinella, Giuseppe Passi: An Early Seventeenth-Century Feminist Controversy |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3735864 |journal=The Modern Language Review |year=2001 |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=973–989 |doi=10.2307/3735864|jstor=3735864 |s2cid=162224637 }}</ref> In response to anti-feminist writings by Passi, she notes that she is unimpressed with the thinking of men. Her writings often pursue root causes of anti-feminist thoughts.

In ''La nobiltà et l'eccellenza delle donne co' diffetti et mancamenti de gli uomini,'' she notes the root of anti-feminist thoughts potentially being attributed to the influence of [[Aristotle]].<ref name=":1"/> She refuses to accept the idea of an imperfect woman, as suggested by Aristotelians. Marinella argued with their belief that women's cold humoral temperaments are inherently different, making them inferior to men.<ref name=":0" /> She does, however, use Aristotle's statements for support in her other arguments.<ref name=":0" />

Marinella also wrote in the style of pastoral romance, as in ''Arcadia Felice.'' This genre was traditionally limited to male authors and featured male characters;  however ''Arcadia Felice'' explores love and eroticism as a plot complication instead of a resolution.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Virginia|title=The Prodigious Muse: Women's Writing in Counter-Reformation Italy.|date=2011|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|page=198|edition=Web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/books/9781421401607/9781421401607-10.pdf|access-date=May 1, 2015}}</ref>

The court of Ferrara encouraged writers to experiment with the pastoral form.<ref name=":4" /> Marinella embraced pastoral writings because it permitted her to describe a society that redefines the relationships between men and women. Pastoral writings among male writers still reinforced patriarchal values and contributed to detrimental beliefs about how women should contribute to society. Conversely, this literature style allowed female authors to experiment and expand female autonomy and power in social systems. Female writers saw writing as a form of self-expression which was discouraged in many elements of their own lives. Pastoral forms provided the perfect sanctuary for Marinella to encode details of her personal life into her writings, like in Arcadia Felice.<ref name=":4" />

==Works ==
[[File:1601 Marinella La Nobilita.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The title page of a 1601 edition of Marinella's ''La nobilita, et l’eccellenza delle donne''.]]
Her work was not without controversy. She frequently wrote in response to polemics against women; ''La nobilita, et l’eccellenza delle donne'' was a defense of educated women who had the right to their opinion''.''<ref name=":1"/>

Marinella was a polished writer in many genres. Her work ranged from philosophical commentaries on poetry to religious works, and drew heavily on a wide variety of sources including scientific and mythological works.  In her lifetime, Marinella published 10 books; there were sometimes as much as 10 years of silence between her works, notably after her marriage to Girolamo Vacca between 1606-1617.<ref>Marinella, Lucrezia, and Anne Dunhill. 1999. ''The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. (pg.8)</ref> Her first polemic, The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men, saw light in 1600, and was composed quickly in response to Giuseppe Passi’s diatribe about women’s defects, ''“Dei donneschi difetti.” He outlines what he deems to be flaws of women including vanity, greed, and sexual excess.''<ref name=":0" /> Marinella's articulated response to Passi's misogynistic claims propelled other people to show their disdain with his writing. Overwhelmed with feedback, Passi eventually stated that he believes he was misinterpreted and gradually moves away from spreading his extremist views about women.<ref name=":02" />

Marinella took the first part of her own title from the Italian translation of a supposedly anonymous French tract, "Della nobilita et eccellenza delle donne,"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_6Ox6XaVD_dcC|title=Della nobiltà et eccellenza delle donne, dalla lingua francese nella italiana tradotto.

''The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. (pg. 2)</ref> The book was largely a long polemic of attacks against women and their defense. It also mounted an attack on men for exactly the same vices Passi had accused women of.<ref name="Marinella, Lucrezia 1999. pg.3"/> The structure of her text follows that of Passi's, as she pits quotations and examples against each other.<ref name=":1"/> Many note that this was her most provocative writing and was likely set-off by Passi's demeaning of female learning and opinions.<ref name=":1" /> Marinella was the first woman in Italy to argue with a man in print, and it was the only time she wrote explicitly about the misogyny of Passi.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kent|first1=Francis William|last2=Zika|first2=Charles|title=Rituals, Images, and Words|date=2005|publisher=Turnhout Brepols Publishers|isbn=978-2-503-53801-3|page=326|edition=Web|url=http://brepols.metapress.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/content/hx52873h7h505h81/fulltext.pdf|access-date=May 1, 2015|ref=Kolsky, Stephen}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Her vibrant responses to misogyny are the reason she is still recognized as one of the great examples of female erudition. It is thought that ''La nobilita, et l’eccellenza delle donne'' was published so quickly due to the connections Marinella had with the Venetian Academy.<ref name=":0" />

In her work ''Enrico'', Marinella selected a topic that was both religious and political, and that also built on her previous works. She highlighted the fact that women were excluded from the political discussion in this time. In the work, she expresses a patriotic pride in Venice and singles out a Venetian version of the events of the Fourth Crusade, about which no contemporary Venetian documents evidently existed. This point in the history of Venice reminds the reader of Venice’s destiny and import.<ref>Marinella, ''Enrico''. Chicago Press. (pg. 4)</ref> In ''Enrico'', Marinella chose to write in one of the highest literary genres of her time, that was for cultural reasons out of favor in Venice. Marinella’s warrior women in ''Enrico'' wear masculine armor with grace and dignity; they were written as respectable in deed and thought, and as chaste virgins ([[Querelle des femmes]]).<ref>Marinella, ''Enrico''.Chicago Press. (pg. 8)</ref> ''Arcadia Felice'' also echoes the idea that love is restricting to women and detrimental to their liberty and creativity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kent|first1=Francis William|last2=Zika|first2=Charles|title=Rituals, Images, and Words|date=2005|publisher=Turnhout Brepols Publishers|isbn=978-2-503-53801-3|page=332|edition=Web|url=http://brepols.metapress.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/content/hx52873h7h505h81/fulltext.pdf|access-date=May 1, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>''

Marinella's work, ''Vita di Maria Vergine'', written in 1602 is well known for recounting the life of the Virgin Mary.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last=Brazeau |first=Bryan |date=2021-06-11 |title='Defying Gravity': Prose Epic and Heroic Style in Lucrezia Marinella's 1602 Vita di Maria Vergine |url=https://academic.oup.com/crj/article/13/1/107/6297009 |journal=Classical Receptions Journal |language=en |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=107–125 |doi=10.1093/crj/claa029 |issn=1759-5142}}</ref> It is written in verse and prose.<ref name=":2" /> The sources for this work are often what sets it apart. Marinella used a combination of Gospel accounts and other gospels such as [[Pseudo-Matthew]] and the [[Protoevangelium of James]], which are to be noted as apocryphal.<ref name=":2" /> However, Lucrezia Marinella has been accused of plagiarizing parts of this text. Scholar, [[Eleonora Carinci]], noted that her work mirrored that of [[Pietro Aretino|Pietro Aretino's]].<ref name=":2" />

Many Catholic females in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries dedicated writings to the Virgin Mary. Marinella wrote one of the longest and articulated works on the Virgin Mary. She details the miracles Mary experienced and the power that can surround female propriety and interests.<ref name=":5" /> The importance Marinella, and other women, allocate on Mary as a positive role model was influential in redistributing purpose back to women and their abilities.

In another one of Lucrezia's notable works ''Amoro Innamorato et Impazzato'': "In Exhortations", however, Marinella seems to recant completely, praising the complete domestication of women and suggesting in the strongest of terms that they avoid scholarly pursuits. According to her arguments, women ought to remain firmly in what I will anachronistically call the private sphere, leaving the world of politics and philosophy for men. Like many of her contemporaries, she uses the ideas of classic authors to make her arguments...She argues in favor of sequestration for women, places the greatest value on the skills women use while managing a home and raising children, and locates all female virtue in the domestic arts."<ref>Byars, Jana. "Byars on Marinella." H-Net Reviews In The Humanities & Social Sciences (December 2012): 1-2. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost</ref> ' She also lamented the state of women in literature and urged women to avoid a literary career in her final work, ''Essortationi alle donne.''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kent|first1=Francis William|last2=Zika|first2=Charles|title=Rituals, Images, and Words|date=2005|publisher=Turnhout Brepols Publishers|isbn=978-2-503-53801-3|page=340|url=http://brepols.metapress.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/content/hx52873h7h505h81/fulltext.pdf|access-date=May 1, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> On seclusion, Lucrezia wrote: "I also stated this in my book entitled
''The Nobility and Excellence of Women'', but now considering the issue in a more mature fashion, I am of the view that it is not the result of conscious manipulation nor the action of an angry soul, but the will and providence of nature and God."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Marinella|first1=Lucrezia|title=Essortationi alle donne et a gli altri se a loro saranno a grado di Lucretia Marinella: Parte prima|date=1645|publisher=Per Francesco Valuasense|location=Venice|page=11}}</ref> Despite her efforts and strong beliefs, her later writings seemed more affected by societal pressures and she seemed less convinced that women would ever fully be accepted as equals to men. In ''Essortationi alle donne,'' she warns women about pursuing professional careers out of their home because of how the system continuously oppresses the success of women.<ref name=":02" />

Marinella's famous ''Nobility and Excellence of Women,'' introduced many protofeminist arguments still studied today.<ref name=":0" /> Her belief that the study of science was at the core of the debate surrounding women was made clear in this work. She outlines the need for equal education opportunity in both literature and sciences for women.<ref name=":0" /> In response to claims there were no educated women in arts and sciences, Marinella proceeds to list various intellectual achievements of women over several centuries, drawing from models such as Famous Women by [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]].<ref name=":0" />''The Nobility and Excellence of Women'', uses these past examples to construct a new definition of womanhood.<ref name=":0" /> This work can be viewed as not only as a women's rights argument, but also a look into women's potential in the scientific and intellectual realm. The ''Nobility and Excellence of Women'' is often compared to [[Moderata Fonte]]'s ''[[The Worth of Women]]'' in academic circles.
