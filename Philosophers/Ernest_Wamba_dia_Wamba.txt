'''Ernest Wamba dia Wamba''' ({{IPA|fr|ɛʁnɛst wɑ̃ba dja wɑ̃ba}}; 1942 – July 15, 2020) was a prominent Congolese academic and political theorist who became a commander of the [[Kisangani]] faction of the rebel [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] during the [[Second Congo War]].<ref name="auto">[https://peoplesdispatch.org/2020/07/17/farewell-ernest-wamba-dia-wamba/ Farewell Ernest Wamba dia Wamba], ''Peoples' Dispatch'', 17 July 2020</ref>

== Early life ==

Wamba dia Wamba was born in [[Sundi-Lutete]], [[Bas-Congo]] Province. He was raised in [[Mission Covenant Church of Sweden|Swedish mission school]]s and grew into adulthood in the period when the [[prophet]]ism of [[Simon Kimbangu]] and the [[Congo Crisis|political agitation for independence]] by the [[ABAKO|Association des Bakongo]] (ABAKO) was reaching its peak. When ABAKO split, he favoured the faction of [[Daniel Kanza]].

Upon graduation from secondary school, he was one of three students awarded scholarships by the [[African-American Institute]] to study in the [[United States]].  He went to [[Western Michigan University]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], where Wamba wrote his honors dissertation on the philosophers [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].  He later went on to graduate studies at [[Claremont Colleges|Claremont]] before teaching at [[Brandeis University]], where he was associated with [[Peter F. Drucker]].  He went on to teach at [[Harvard University]].

During his period in the U.S., Wamba dia Wamba married an [[African-American]] woman and was involved in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] through the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] .  Once the period of [[decolonization of Africa|decolonization]] began in [[Africa]], he joined the supporting committees of various US-based [[pan-African]]ist movements.<ref name="auto"/>

In 1980, he accepted a position as Professor of History at the [[University of Dar es Salaam]] in [[Tanzania]].  In 1981, while visiting his parents' village in Zaire, he was arrested by the government of [[Mobutu Sese-Seko]] for possessing a paper he had authored that was deemed 'subversive', and was detained for one year.  He continued his role as a prominent figure in both academia and political circles in Africa.  He is the former president of the [[Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa]] (CODESRIA) as well as the founder and president of the philosophy club at the [[University of Dar es Salaam]].  He was an expert in the [[Palaver (politics)]] and other indigenous forms of African democracy.  He participated in the Sovereign National Conference, held from 1990 through 1992 in Zaire.  In 1997 he co-authored with [[Jacques Depelchin]], the [[African Declaration Against Genocide]].

In December 1997, Wamba was named a recipient of the Dutch [[Prince Claus Awards|Prince Claus Award for Culture and Development]].  The announcement of the award cited his "scholarly contribution to the development of [[African philosophy]] and for sparking off the philosophical debate on social and political themes in Africa."  At this time he also worked closely with Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] to end the [[Burundi Civil War]].

== The Second Congo War ==

At the beginning of the [[Second Congo War]] against the government of [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], Wamba was unanimously elected head of the rebel [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD), which was backed by [[Uganda]] and [[Rwanda]] and based in the town of [[Goma]]. However, the RCD gradually split from November 1998 until 16 May 1999, as it became clear that Rwanda and its supporters' goals were limited to replacement of Kabila.  Several attempts were made on Wamba's life during this period, coinciding with attempts to destroy his political power in the RCD.

On 16 May 1999, [[Émile Ilunga]] was named the new head of the RCD after manoeuvring by Rwanda, and Wamba fled to the Ugandan-controlled town of [[Kisangani]]. The faction of the RCD he maintained control of was variously known as the Movement for Liberation (RCD-ML), RCD-Kisangani, or RCD-Wamba.  The main faction is sometimes referred to as [[RCD-Goma]].  The two factions shortly engaged in fierce battles in Kisangani, following which Wamba retreated to [[Bunia]] in the [[Ituri region]] of the northeastern DRC.

Wamba was faced with an internal revolt by [[Mbusa Nyamwisi]], leading to another split in his party's faction.  His organization remained known as the RCD-Kisangani (RCD-K), while the Nyamwisi-led group was known as the RCD-ML.  In 2001, Wamba denounced a Ugandan proposal to unite the RCD-K, RCD-ML and [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] (MLC) as an unwelcome foreign imposition.  The further disintegration of the RCD-K to the point it was without any significant military force may have been the result of Ugandan withdrawal of its support.  This action, which took place as the [[Ituri conflict]] continued escalating, was seen by some members of the [[Lendu]] ethnic group as a support against{{clarify|date=June 2021}} what they saw as the pro-[[Hema people|Hema]] bias of Uganda.

==The Post-War Period ==

Following the [[Inter-Congolese Dialogue]] that ended the war, Wamba became a prominent member of the new government.  He spoke extensively on what was needed for the DRC to make a successful transition to a functioning democracy.

He continued to be politically involved and to write, and was a noted political theorist widely respected for, in particular, his innovative use of the work of the African-born Parisian philosopher [[Alain Badiou]], whom he introduced to contemporary African political thought. Scholars of Africana like [[Jacques Depelchin]], [[Michael Neocosmos]]<ref>For instance see the paper at http://abahlali.org/node/2826</ref> and [[Raj Patel]]<ref>For instance see the paper [http://www.abahlali.org/files/Pages%20from%20CCS%20Report%20New%20Work%20From%20Durban_Patel.pdf "A Short Course in Politics at the University of Abahlali Basemjondolo"]. Centre For Civil Society Research Report No.42.</ref> have taken up Wamba's use of Badiou's work.

A May 2008 article authored by Jacques Depelchin warned that there were new threats to assassinate Wamba.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pambazuka.org/governance/assassination-threat-against-wamba-dia-wamba-and-kiakwama|title=Assassination threat against Wamba dia Wamba and Kiakwama &#124; Pambazuka News|website=www.pambazuka.org|date=4 March 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://otabenga.org/node/114 |title=Link to assassination warning on Ota Benga Alliance site |access-date=2008-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703214145/http://otabenga.org/node/114 |archive-date=2008-07-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the last years of his life, Wamba remained politically active, running reading groups with young activists in [[Kinshasa]] and engaging popular organisations across the continent,<ref name="auto"/> including [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]].<ref>[http://abahlali.org/node/17149/ Hamba Kahle Ernest Wamba-dia-Wambia], Abahlali baseMjondolo press statement, 16 July 2020</ref>
