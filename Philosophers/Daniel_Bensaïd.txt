'''Daniel Bensaïd''' (25 March 1946 – 12 January 2010<ref name="liberation" />) was a [[philosopher]] and a leader of the [[Trotskyist]] movement in France. He became a leading figure in the student revolt of 1968, while studying at the [[Paris Nanterre University|University of Paris X: Nanterre]].

== Life and career ==
Bensaïd was born in [[Toulouse]], France, to a father who was a [[Sephardic Jew]] from [[Algeria]], and who had moved from [[Oran]], where he met Bensaïd's mother, to [[Vichy France|Vichy]] Toulouse.<ref name="guardianobit" /> In response to the [[Torture during the Algerian War#The 8 February 1962 Charonne massacre|8 February 1962 Charonne massacre]] of Algerians in [[Paris]], Bensaïd joined the [[Union of Communist Students]]. Irritated by the party orthodoxy he swiftly became part of a left opposition within the union, and was among the dissidents expelled from the party in 1966.<ref name="guardianobit" />

In 1966, Bensaïd began studying at the [[École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud]], where he helped found the ''Jeunesse Communiste Révolutionnaire'', which became the [[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|Ligue Communiste Révolutionnaire]] (LCR).<ref name="guardianobit" /> With [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] he helped to found the [[Movement of 22 March|Mouvement du 22 Mars]] (Movement of 22 March), which was involved in the protests of [[May 68|May 1968 in France]].<ref name="guardianobit" />

Bensaïd became a leading theorist of the LCR and the [[United Secretariat of the Fourth International]], and a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Paris-VIII]]. He was also a Fellow at the [[International Institute for Research and Education]]. Upon his death, [[Tariq Ali]] described him as "France's leading Marxist public intellectual, much in demand on talkshows and writing essays and reviews in ''[[Le Monde]]'' and ''[[Libération]]''."<ref name="guardianobit" /> Bensaïd was known for his studies of [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Karl Marx]], and a recent analysis of French [[postmodernism]].

He died of [[cancer]] on 12 January 2010 at the age of 63, arising from the side effects of drugs used to treat [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], which he had had for the previous 16 years.<ref name="guardianobit" />

== Criticism and debate ==
Bensaïd and the current of Trotskyism represented by the Unified Secretariat of the Fourth International have come under attack from more orthodox Trotskyists for the strategy they have advanced of entering the "new social movements"; in particular, for seeing reform and revolution as a [[false dichotomy]], and proposing the formation of "broad parties," rather than forming parties of the traditional Leninist type. In one such critique, Luke Cooper criticised Bensaïd for arguing that—in certain specific circumstances—it maybe permissible to enter a capitalist government, and seek to use the existing state as an instrument of revolutionary transformation.<ref name="fifthinternational" /> Bensaïd also debated revolutionary strategy with other Fourth International members, and the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]]'s International Secretary [[Alex Callinicos]].<ref name="internationalviewpoint" />
