== Biography ==

Caio Prado graduated with a degree in [[law]] from Faculdade do Largo de São Francisco, [[São Paulo]] in 1928, where he would later become a [[Professor]] of Political Economy. He was politically active during the 1930s and 1940s, including during the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|1930 Revolution]]. In 1933, he published his first work - ''Evolução Política do Brasil'' (Political Evolution of Brazil) - an attempt to understand the country's political and social history. In 1934 he took part in the foundation of Brazilian Geographers Association.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

After a trip to the Soviet Union, at the time under Stalin's dictatorship, he published ''URSS - um novo mundo'' (Soviet Union - a New World), which was banned by [[Getúlio Vargas]]' government's censorship. He then joined the [[National Liberation Alliance (Brazil)|Aliança Nacional Libertadora]] which he chaired in São Paulo.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

In 1942 he published the classic ''Formação do Brasil Contemporâneo - Colônia'' (Formation of Contemporary Brazil - Colony), which should have been the first part of a work on Brazilian historic evolution. However, the following volumes were never written. In 1945 he was elected ''deputado estadual'' for the ''Brazilian Communist Party''. He published the newspaper ''A Platéia'' and, in 1943, with Arthur Neves and [[Monteiro Lobato]], he founded Editora Brasiliense (Brasiliense Publishing House), for which, later, he published ''Revista Brasiliense'', between 1956 and 1964. After 1964, he was persecuted by the military dictatorship.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

In 1966 he was elected Intellectual of the Year by the União Brasileira de Escritores, following the publication of ''A revolução brasileira'' (Brazilian Revolution).
