'''Pierre Laffitte''' (21 February 1823 – 4 January 1903) was a French [[Sociological positivism|positivist]] philosopher.

Laffitte was born at [[Béguey]], [[Gironde]]. Residing at Paris as a teacher of [[mathematics]], he became a disciple of [[Auguste Comte]], who appointed him his literary executor. On the schism of the Positivist body which followed Comte's death, he was recognized as head of the section which accepted the full Comtian doctrine; the other section adhered to [[Émile Littré]], who rejected the [[religion of humanity]] as inconsistent with the philosophy of science of Comte's earlier period. From 1853 Laffitte delivered Positivist lectures in the room formerly occupied by Comte in the rue Monsieur le Prince. He published ''Les Grands Types de l'humanité'' (1875) and ''Cours de philosophie première'' (1889). In 1893 he was appointed to the new chair founded at the [[Collège de France]] for the exposition of the general [[history of science]], and it was largely due to his inspiration that a statue to Comte was erected in the Place de la [[Sorbonne (building)|Sorbonne]] in 1902. Laffitte died in Paris.
Lafitte with a delegation of positivists visited Constantinople in 1877 visited Midhat Pasha to advocate positivist principles as a non-Christian, modern system.
