'''James Hutchison Stirling''' (22 June 1820 – 19 March 1909) was a Scottish idealist [[philosopher]]<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/stirling James Hutchison Stirling (1820–1909), in Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref> and physician. His work ''[[The Secret of Hegel]]'' (1st edition, 1865, in 2 vols.; revised edition, 1898, in 1 vol.) gave great impetus to the study of [[Hegelian]] philosophy both in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and in the [[United States]], and it was also accepted as an authoritative work on Hegel's philosophy in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]].{{sfn|Cousin|1910}} The book helped to create the [[philosophical movement]] known as [[British idealism]].<ref>William J. Mander, ''British Idealism: A History'', Oxford University Press, 2011, pp. 17–18.</ref>

James Hutchison Stirling was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, the fifth son (and the youngest of six children) of William Stirling (died 14 March 1851)<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo1.ark:/13960/t3708n81r;view=1up;seq=111;size=75 ''James Hutchison Stirling: His Life and Work'' (1912), by Amelia Hutchison Stirling, p. 103]</ref> and Elizabeth Christie (d. 1828).<ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100533383 Oxford Index – James Hutchison Stirling (1820–1909)]</ref><ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo1.ark:/13960/t3708n81r;view=1up;seq=25;size=75 ''James Hutchison Stirling: His Life and Work'' (1912), pp. 17–18]</ref> William was a wealthy textile manufacturer who was a partner in the Glasgow firm of James Hutchison & Co., which manufactured muslin (lightweight cotton cloth in a plain weave, used for making sheets and for a variety of other purposes).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5aVDAQAAMAAJ&dq=William+Stirling+-+James+Hutchison+%26+Co.&pg=PA622 Article on "Stirling, James Hutchison, LL.D" in ''Who's Who 1897 – First Year of New Issue'' (London: Adam & Charles Black, Soho Square, 1897) (ed. by Douglas Sladen), p. 622]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/slatersdirectory1855scot ''Slater's Directory of Glasgow and its Vicinity'' (1855) (Hutchison, James & Co. is listed under "Manufacturers of Muslins" on p. 46)]</ref> William was known for his deeply-held religious views, many of which strongly influenced his son James.

Stirling studied at Young's Academy in Glasgow, followed by nine years of education (1833–1842) at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he studied medicine, history, and classics. He became a Licentiate (1842, medical diploma) and Fellow (1860) of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]].

Stirling married Jane Hunter Mair (died 5 July 1903), an old family friend, on 28 April 1847 in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]]. The couple had seven children (five daughters and two sons), as follows:  Jessie Jane Stirling (born 26 June 1850) (who married Rev. Robert Armstrong of Glasgow), Elizabeth Margaret Stirling (11 February 1852 – 1871), Amelia Hutchison Stirling, [[Florence Hutchison-Stirling|Florence Hutchison Stirling]] (1858 – 6 May 1948), Lucy Stirling, William Stirling, and David Stirling. Stirling's daughter Amelia wrote many books on historical subjects, and she was the joint-translator{{mdash}}with William Hale White (1831–1913){{mdash}}of Spinoza's ''Ethics'' (1883). She also wrote a biography of her father James titled ''James Hutchison Stirling: His Life and Work'' (London and Leipzig: T. Fisher Unwin, 1912). Stirling's daughter Florence won the Scottish Ladies' Championship in chess five times (in 1905, 1906, 1907, 1912, and 1913).<ref>[https://www.chessscotland.com/documents/history/biographies/stirling.htm Chess Scotland – Florence Hutchison Stirling]</ref><ref>[https://www.chessscotland.com/documents/archiveresults/champwoman.htm Chess Scotland – Women Champions]</ref>

After receiving a large inheritance from his father's estate in 1851, Stirling left his medical practice.{{sfn|Cousin|1910}} He then set out to learn French and German, for the purpose of being able to better understand continental philosophical trends. In pursuit of this goal, he moved his family briefly to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], France (located in the current [[Pas-de-Calais]] department of the [[Hauts-de-France]] region), then to Paris for 18 months, then to [[St. Servan]] (located two miles from the ferry port of [[St. Malo]] in the [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] department of the [[Brittany]] region of France) for four and a half years, and then finally to Heidelberg, Germany. In November 1857, Stirling and his family took up residence in London (at 3 Wilton Terrace, Kensington), where they lived for about three years.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo1.ark:/13960/t3708n81r;view=1up;seq=146;size=75 ''James Hutchison Stirling: His Life and Work'' (1912), p. 136]</ref> After this, in 1860 Stirling returned to [[Edinburgh]]{{mdash}}his address there was 4 Laverockbank Road, [[Trinity, Edinburgh]]<ref>Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1908-9</ref>{{mdash}}which then became his permanent residence until the end of his life, and where he wrote on the philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) and many other subjects. The primary result of his comprehensive Hegel studies was his influential work ''The Secret of Hegel'' (2 vols., 1865).

One of Stirling's other major philosophical works{{mdash}}''Philosophy and Theology'' (1890) (consisting of his 20 [[Gifford Lectures]], delivered at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1889–1890){{mdash}}focuses not on Hegelian philosophical topics, but on [[Charles Darwin]]'s evolutionary theories.

[[Frederick Copleston]] (''A History of Philosophy'' vol. VII, p.&nbsp;12) wrote: "we may be inclined to smile at J. H. Stirling's picture of Hegel as the great champion of Christianity".

Stirling died in Edinburgh and is buried in [[Warriston Cemetery]] on the north side of the city. His grave lies in the centre of the long, upper section north of the vaults, facing south onto an east–west path.
