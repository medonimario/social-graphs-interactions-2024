'''Antonio Negri''' (1 August 1933 – 16 December 2023) was an Italian [[political philosopher]] known as one of the most prominent theorists of [[autonomism]], as well as for his co-authorship of ''[[Empire (Hardt and Negri book)|Empire]]'' with [[Michael Hardt]]. Born in [[Padua]], Italy, Negri became a professor of political philosophy at the [[University of Padua]], where he taught state and constitutional theory.<ref name=":0" /> Negri founded the [[Potere Operaio]] (Worker Power) group in 1969 and was a leading member of [[Autonomia Operaia]], and published highly influential books, including [[Empire (Hardt and Negri book)|''Empire'']] and  ''[[Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire]],'' urging "revolutionary consciousness."

Negri was accused in the late 1970s of being the mastermind of the left-wing [[urban guerrilla]] organization [[Red Brigades]] ({{lang|it|Brigate Rosse}} or BR),<ref name="portelli" /> which was involved in the [[Kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro|May 1978 kidnapping and murder]] of former Italian prime minister [[Aldo Moro]]. On 7 April 1979, Negri was arrested and charged with a number of crimes including the Moro murder. Most charges were quickly dropped, but in 1984, having fled to France, he was sentenced ''in absentia'' to 30 years in prison. He was given an additional four years on the charge of being "[[morally responsible]]" for the violence of political activists in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Oxford Reference|title=Antonio Negri|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100227463|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405212445/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100227463 |archive-date=5 April 2017 }}</ref> The question of Negri's involvement with [[left-wing extremism]] is a controversial subject.<ref name=drake>Drake, Richard.

Negri fled to France where, protected by the [[Mitterrand doctrine]], he taught at the [[Paris VIII (Vincennes)]] and the [[Collège international de philosophie]], along with [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]]. In 1997, after a plea-bargain that reduced his prison time from 30 to 13 years,<ref name=windschuttle>Windschuttle, Keith.

Many of his most influential books were published while he was behind bars. After his release he lived in Venice and Paris with his partner, the French philosopher [[Judith Revel]]. He was the father of film director [[Anna Negri]].

== Early years ==
Antonio Negri was born in [[Padua]], in the [[Northeastern Italian]] region of [[Veneto]], in 1933. His father was an active communist [[militant]] from the city of [[Bologna]] (in the Northeastern [[Italian region]] of [[Emilia-Romagna]]), and although he died when Negri was two years old, his political engagement made Negri familiar with [[Marxism]] from an early age, while his mother was a teacher from the town of [[Poggio Rusco]] (in the [[province of Mantua]], Lombardy).<ref name=alqua2>{{cite web|url= http://www.autistici.org/operaismo/alquati/5_1.htm|title= Intervista a Romano Alquati|editor= Autistici/Inventati|pages= 5, 13, 15, 17–18|access-date= 2 December 2018|archive-date= 4 March 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185616/http://www.autistici.org/operaismo/alquati/5_1.htm|url-status= live}}</ref> He began his career as a militant in the 1950s with the activist Roman Catholic youth organization Gioventú Italiana di Azione Cattolica (GIAC). Negri became a [[communist]] in 1953–54 when he worked at a [[kibbutz]] in Israel for a year. The kibbutz was organised according to ideas of [[Zionist socialism]] and all the members were Jewish communists.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ganahl|first=Rainer|url=http://semiotexte.com/?p=660|title=Marx is still Marx: Antonio Negri|work=Semiotext(e)|date=3 October 2010|access-date=28 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030001958/http://semiotexte.com/?p=660|archive-date=30 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> He joined the [[Italian Socialist Party]] in 1956 and remained a member until 1963, while at the same time becoming more and more engaged throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s in Marxist movements.<ref name=":2">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2009 |title=Negri, Antonio (b. 1933) |encyclopedia=The International Encyclopedia of Revolution and Protest |publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]] |last=Murphy |first=Timothy S. |pages=1–2 |doi=10.1002/9781405198073.wbierp1075 |isbn=9781405198073}}</ref>

== Arrest and flight ==
On 16 March 1978, [[Aldo Moro]], the party leader of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] and the former Italian prime minister, was kidnapped in Rome by the [[Red Brigades]]. Forty-five days after the kidnapping and nine days before [[Moro's death]],<ref name=windschuttle/> the Red Brigades called his family and informed Moro's wife of his impending death.<ref name=windschuttle/> The conversation was recorded and later broadcast.

On 7 April 1979 Negri and other activists were charged with kidnapping, assassination and insurrection.<ref name=":2" /> Padova's Public Prosecutor Pietro Calogero accused them of being involved in the political wing of the Red Brigades, and thus behind [[left-wing terrorism]] in Italy. Negri was charged with a number of offences, including leadership of the Red Brigades, masterminding the 1978 kidnapping and murder of the President of the Christian Democratic Party Aldo Moro, and plotting to overthrow the government.<ref name="bull">{{cite journal |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n19/malcolm-bull/you-cant-build-a-new-society-with-a-stanley-knife |title=You can't build a new society with a Stanley knife |author=Malcolm Bull |journal=London Review of Books |date=4 October 2001 |volume=23 |issue=19 |access-date=12 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113214455/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n19/malcolm-bull/you-cant-build-a-new-society-with-a-stanley-knife |archive-date=13 January 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> At the time, Negri was a political science professor at the University of Padua and visiting lecturer at Paris' [[École Normale Supérieure]].

Some of his peers found little fault with Negri's activities.

In France, Negri began teaching at the [[Paris VIII (Vincennes)]],<ref name=":0" /> and also at the [[Collège international de philosophie]] founded by [[Jacques Derrida]].

=== ''Labor of Dionysus: A Critique of the State-Form'' (1994)===
Written together with Michael Hardt, the authors ask themselves in this book, "How is it, then, that labour, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society?" The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labour in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/labor-of-dionysus|title=Labor of Dionysus|website=University of Minnesota Press|access-date=17 December 2023|archive-date=10 June 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230610211412/https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/labor-of-dionysus|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== ''Empire'' (2000) ===
{{main|Empire (Hardt and Negri book)}}

In general, the book theorizes an ongoing transition from a "modern" phenomenon of [[imperialism]], centered around individual [[nation-states]], to an emergent [[postmodern]] construct created among ruling powers which the authors call "Empire", with different forms of warfare:
<blockquote>According to Hardt and Negri's ''Empire'', the rise of Empire is the end of national conflict, the "enemy" now, whoever he is, can no longer be ideological or national. The enemy now must be understood as a kind of criminal, as someone who represents a threat not to a political system or a nation but to the law. This is the enemy as a terrorist&nbsp;... In the "new order that envelops the entire space of&nbsp;... civilization", where conflict between nations has been made irrelevant, the "enemy" is simultaneously "banalized" (reduced to an object of routine police repression) and absolutized (like the Enemy, an absolute threat to the ethical order"<ref>Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt, ''Empire'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts & London, England: Harvard University Press, 2000), pg 6.</ref>).<ref>Walter Benn Michaels, ''The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the end of history'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pp. 171–172.</ref></blockquote>

''Empire'' elaborates a variety of ideas surrounding constitutions, global war, and class. Hence, the Empire is constituted by a monarchy (the United States and the [[G8]], and [[international organizations]] such as [[NATO]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] or the [[World Trade Organization]]), an [[oligarchy]] (the [[multinational corporations]] and other nation-states) and a democracy (the various [[non-government organization]]s and the United Nations). Part of the book's analysis deals with "imagin<nowiki>[ing]</nowiki> resistance", but "the point of Empire is that it, too, is "total" and that resistance to it can only take the form of negation – "the will to be against".<ref>Walter Benn Michaels, ''The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the end of history'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pg 173.</ref> The Empire is total, but [[economic inequality]] persists, and as all identities are wiped out and replaced with a universal one, the identity of the poor persists.<ref>"The problem, as they see it, is that "postmodernist authors" have neglected the one identity that should matter most to those on the left, the one we have always with us: "The only non-localizable 'common name' of pure difference in all eras is that of the poor" (156)&nbsp;... only the poor, Hardt and Negri say, "live radically the actual and present being" (157)." Walter Benn Michaels, ''The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the end of history'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pp. 179–180.</ref>

=== ''Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire'' (2004)===
{{main|Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire}}
''Multitude'' addresses these issues and picks up the thread where ''Empire'' leaves off. In order to do so, Hardt and Negri argue, one must first analyze the present configuration of war and its contradictions. This analysis is performed in the first chapter, after which chapters two and three focus on multitude and democracy, respectively. ''Multitude'' is not so much a sequel as it is a reiteration from a new point of view in a new, relatively accessible style that is distinct from the predominantly [[Academia|academic]] prose style of ''Empire''. Multitude remains, the authors insist, despite its ubiquitous subject matter and its almost casual tone, a book of philosophy which aims to shape a conceptual ground for a political process of democratization rather than present an answer to the question 'what to do?' or offer a programme for concrete action.<ref>{{Citation | title= Love's Lessons: Intimacy, Pedagogy and Political Community | first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Hannah | last2= Stark | journal= [[Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]] | volume= 22 | issue= 4 | pages= 69–79 | year= 2017 | url= https://www.academia.edu/35349930 | access-date= 3 January 2018 | archive-date= 21 February 2023 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230221024035/https://www.academia.edu/35349930 | url-status= live }}</ref>

{{main|Commonwealth (Hardt and Negri book)}}In 2009 Negri completed the book ''Commonwealth'', the final in a trilogy that began in 2000 with ''Empire'' and continued with ''Multitude'' in 2004, co-authored with Michael Hardt.<ref name="gray">{{cite news |author=Gray, John |date=20 November 2009 |title=Commonwealth, By Michael Hardt & Antonio Negri / First as Tragedy, Then as Farce, By Slavoj Zizek |work=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/commonwealth-by-michael-hardt-amp--antonio-negribrfirst-as-tragedy-then-as-farce-by-slavoj-zizek-1823817.html |url-status=live |access-date=12 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144240/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/commonwealth-by-michael-hardt-amp--antonio-negribrfirst-as-tragedy-then-as-farce-by-slavoj-zizek-1823817.html |archive-date=14 November 2014}}</ref>[[File:Antonio Negri y Michael Hardt.jpg|thumbnail|right|Antonio Negri holding a copy of ''[[Commonwealth (Hardt and Negri book)|Commonwealth]]'', with co-author [[Michael Hardt]]]]
In this book, the authors introduce the concept of "the republic of property": "What is central for our purposes here is that the concept of property and the defence of property remain the foundation of every modern political constitution. This is the sense in which the republic, from the great bourgeois revolutions to today, is a republic of property".<ref>Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. ''Commonwealth''. Harvard University Press. 2009. Pg.15</ref> Part 2 of the book deals with the relationship between modernity and anti-modernity and proposes "[[altermodernity]]". Altermodernity "involves not only insertion in the long history of antimodern struggles but also rupture with any fixed dialectic between modern sovereignty and antimodern resistance. In the passage from antimodernity to altermodernity, just as tradition and identity are transformed, so too resistance takes on a new meaning, dedicated now to the constitution of alternatives. The freedom that forms the base of resistance, as we explained earlier, comes to the fore and constitutes an event to announce a new political project."<ref>Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. ''Commonwealth''. Harvard University Press. 2009. Pg.107</ref>

For [[Alex Callinicos]] in a review "What is newest in ''Commonwealth'' is its take on the fashionable idea of the common. Hardt and Negri mean by this not merely the natural resources that capital seeks to appropriate, but also "the languages we create, the social practices we establish, the modes of sociality that define our relationships", which are both the means and the result of biopolitical production. Communism, they argue, is defined by the common, just as capitalism is by the private and socialism (which they identify in effect with statism) with the public."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=11189 |title=Commonwealth.

The choice between capitalism and socialism, they suggest, is all wrong. We need to identify something entirely different, communism – working within a different set of dimensions."<ref name="korotonomedya1">{{Cite web |url=http://www.korotonomedya.net/kor/index.php?id=27,316,0,0,1,0 |title=David Harvey, Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt.

It 'should not shun identity politics but instead must work through it and learn from it,' because it is the 'primary vehicle for struggle within and against the republic of property since identity itself is based on property and sovereignty.'"<ref name="korotonomedya1"/> In the same exchange in [[Artforum]] between Harvey and Micheal Hardt and Antonio Negri, Hardt and Negri attempt to correct Harvey in a concept that is important within the argument of ''Commonwealth''. As such, they state that "We instead define the concept of [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]], contrasting it to the figure of the individual on the one hand and forms of identity on the other, by focusing on three aspects of its relationship to multiplicity: Singularity refers externally to a multiplicity of others; is internally divided or multiple; and constitutes a multiplicity over time – that is, a process of becoming."<ref name="korotonomedya1"/>

After ''Commonwealth'', he wrote multiple notable articles on the [[Arab Spring]] and [[Occupy movement|Occupy]] movements along with other social issues.<ref name="Arab">Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/24/arabs-democracy-latin-america Arabs are democracy's new pioneers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312211820/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/24/arabs-democracy-latin-america|date=12 March 2017}}, The Guardian, 24 February 2011.</ref><ref name="Foreign">Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136399/michael-hardt-and-antonio-negri/the-fight-for-real-democracy-at-the-heart-of-occupy-wall-street The Fight for 'Real Democracy' at the Heart of Occupy Wall Street] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811060640/http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136399/michael-hardt-and-antonio-negri/the-fight-for-real-democracy-at-the-heart-of-occupy-wall-street|date=11 August 2014}}, Foreign Affairs, 11 October 2011.</ref>

=== Occupy movements of 2011–2012 and ''Declaration'' ===
In May 2012 Negri self-published (with Michael Hardt) an electronic pamphlet on the [[Occupy movement|occupy and encampment movements of 2011–2012]] called ''[[Declaration (book)|Declaration]]'' that argues the movement explores new forms of democracy. The introduction was published at ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' under the title "Take Up the Baton". He also published an article with Hardt in ''Foreign Affairs'' in October 2011 stating "The Encampment in Lower Manhattan Speaks to a Failure of Representation."<ref name="Foreign" />

=== ''Assembly'' and essay collections (2013–2023) ===
In 2013, Negri published ''Spinoza: Politics and Postmodernity'', a collections of essays on Spinoza and his contemporary relevance to philosophy and political theory, translated into English by William McCuaig.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Negri|first1=Antonio|url=https://columbia.universitypressscholarship.com/10.7312/columbia/9780231160469.001.0001/upso-9780231160469|title=Spinoza for Our Time: Politics and Postmodernity|last2=Gangle|first2=Rocco|date=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-16046-9|translator-last=McCuaig|translator-first=William|doi=10.7312/columbia/9780231160469.001.0001|access-date=22 October 2021|archive-date=17 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231217235602/https://academic.oup.com/columbia-scholarship-online|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2017, Negri and Michael Hardt published ''Assembly''.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Hardt|first1=Michael|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/assembly-9780190677961?cc=gb&lang=en&|title=Assembly|last2=Negri|first2=Antonio|date=26 October 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-067796-1|series=Heretical Thought|location=Oxford, New York|access-date=22 October 2021|archive-date=22 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211022235515/https://global.oup.com/academic/product/assembly-9780190677961?cc=gb&lang=en&|url-status=live}}</ref> The book provides a series of reflections on the nature of contemporary capitalism and social movements, drawing together the concepts and ideas explored previously in their ''Empire'' 'trilogy' such as the common, the multitude, and globalisation. It also introduces a new political concept of 'assembly', which draws on Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's concept of an 'assemblage' (French: ''agencements'') as a way of thinking about mass movements and the role of constituent power. It also provides analyses of events that occurred in the years since ''Commonwealth'' was published in 2009, such as the rise of [[right-wing populism]], [[Occupy Wall Street]], the [[automation]] of work, and the [[digital economy]]. It continues their reflections on the character and goals of leaderless movements, and especially focuses on the ways in which these movements can seek to self-organise in [[Radical democracy|radically democratic]] and egalitarian ways. They propose that instead of the usual model of leadership and movement in which leadership serves to articulate the long-term and 'large scale' programme of the multitude, this relationship should instead be inverted: leadership instead comes to serve specific, tactical, and short-term ends (such as the organisation of specific moblisations, protests, direct action, strikes, etc.), while the multitude (or collective) serves to "articulate the long-term goals and objectives" to which the leadership must submit and facilitate.

The book received generally positive reviews. Writing for ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'', Kyle Perry argues that the central claim of the book is that "advocates for a truly democratic world must no longer refuse the demands of leading, strategizing, decision making, and institution building that can otherwise remain variously secondary, absent, or anathema amid left, liberatory, and progressive causes."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Services|first=University of Chicago IT|title=Critical Inquiry|url=https://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/kyle_parry_reviews_assembly/|access-date=22 October 2021|website=criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu|language=en|archive-date=22 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211022235516/https://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/kyle_parry_reviews_assembly/|url-status=live}}</ref> It also rejects as a false binary the idea that liberal-democratic institutions should either be occupied or destroyed; instead, "The better move is to get creative about inventing new, effective, and crucially 'nonsovereign' institutions. Such institutions are not meant to 'rule over us' but to 'foster continuity and organization" and to "help organize our practices, manage our relationships, and together make decisions'." Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]],'' Terence Renaud argues that "Given how much the political terrain has changed since ''Empire'' appeared in 2000, much of Hardt and Negri's project appears dead. It has said all that it's going to say. Even so, the authors do an excellent job of highlighting the internal challenges that a resurgent left will face. Every new left risks degenerating into sectarian conflict, heavy-handed leadership, and complacency about its own righteousness. Hardt and Negri insist on a self-critical and internally democratic left that never ceases to call its own assumptions into question. In order to transform society, the left must first transform itself."<ref>{{Cite web|date=16 August 2018|title=Los Angeles Review of Books|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/assembling-a-new-left/|access-date=22 October 2021|website=Los Angeles Review of Books|language=en-US|archive-date=22 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211022235515/https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/assembling-a-new-left/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Between 2016 and 2019, Negri published a three-volume collection of essays written in various years, but translated, collected and published together in English in these volumes. The first volume was titled ''Marx and Foucault'', and published on 16 December 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|date=27 March 2016|title=Marx and Foucault|url=https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/|access-date=22 October 2021|website=[[Polity]]|language=en-US|archive-date=8 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211108172603/https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail/|url-status=live}}</ref> In this first volume, Negri aims to show "how the thinking of Marx and Foucault were brought together to create an original theoretical synthesis – particularly in the context of Italy from May '68 onwards." The second volume was titled ''From the Factory to the Metropolis,'' and was published in February 2018. This second volume turns towards an analysis of the passage from the traditional proletarian 'mass worker' of industrial capitalism (especially as found in Marx's writing) to the contemporary 'socialised worker', as well as of the modern 'metropolis', which Negri describes as "a space of antagonisms between forms of life produced, on the one hand, by finance capital (the capital that operates around rents), and on the other by the 'cognitive proletariat'. The central question is then how 'the common' of the latter can be mobilised for the destruction of capitalism."<ref>{{Cite web|date=27 March 2016|title=From the Factory to the Metropolis|url=https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/|access-date=22 October 2021|website=[[Polity]]|language=en-US|archive-date=8 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211108172603/https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail/|url-status=live}}</ref> The third and final volume of this 'trilogy' was titled ''Spinoza: Then and Now'', which was published in February 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|date=27 March 2016|title=Spinoza|url=https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/|access-date=22 October 2021|website=[[Polity]]|language=en-US|archive-date=8 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211108172603/https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail/|url-status=live}}</ref> In this third volume, Negri "examines how Spinoza's thought constitutes a radical break with past ideas and an essential tool for envisaging a form of politics beyond capitalism."

On 29 October 2021, Negri published the first volume of a new trilogy of books. This first volume is titled ''Marx in Movement: Operaismo in Context'', and seeks to provide an account and examination of the history of Italian Autonomist (or '[[Autonomism|Autonomist Marxist]]') thought, particularly in terms of Negri's theoretical development of the concept of the 'social worker' as an attempt to update Marxism in light of the changes since the factory-based industrial labour of Marx's time.<ref>{{Cite web|date=27 March 2016|title=Marx in Movement|url=https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/|access-date=22 October 2021|website=[[Polity]]|language=en-US|archive-date=8 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211108172603/https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail/|url-status=live}}</ref>
