'''David Riazanov''' ({{langx|ru|Дави́д Ряза́нов}}), born '''David Borisovich Goldendakh''' ({{langx|ru|Дави́д Бори́сович Гольдендах}}; 10 March 1870 – 21 January 1938), was a Russian revolutionary, historian, [[bibliography|bibliographer]] and [[archivist]]. He had been an old associate of [[Leon Trotsky]].<ref name="Longley" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=Isaac |title=The Prophet: The Life of Leon Trotsky |date=5 January 2015 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn=978-1-78168-721-5 |page=1206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGznDwAAQBAJ&q=isaac+deutscher+trotsky+the+prophet |language=en}}</ref> Riazanov founded the [[Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute|Marx–Engels Institute]] and edited the first large-scale effort to publish the collected works of these two founders of the modern socialist movement. Riazanov was a prominent victim of the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of the late 1930s.

==Early years==
David Borisovich Goldendakh was born 10 March 1870 to a [[Jews|Jewish]] father and a [[Russians|Russian]] mother in [[Odesa]], [[Ukraine]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name="Leckey129">Colum Leckey, "David Riazanov and Russian Marxism," ''Russian History/Histoire Russe,'' vol. 22, no. 2 (Summer 1995), pg. 129.</ref> At the age of 15, the future David Riazanov joined the ranks of the [[Narodnik]] revolutionaries attempting to overthrow the [[autocracy]] of the Russian Tsar.<ref name="Tracht5">Alexander Trachtenberg, "Introduction" to D. Riazanov, ''Karl Marx and Frederick Engels.'' New York: International Publishers, 1927; pg. 5.</ref> Riazanov attended [[Gymnasium (school)|secondary school]] in Odesa but was expelled in 1886, not for revolutionary activity or insubordination, but rather due to "hopeless inability."<ref name="Leckey129" />
[[File:Д. Б. Рязанов в 1890-е.jpg|thumb|Riazanov in late 1880s]]
Riazanov traveled abroad in 1889 and 1891 where he met various Russian [[Marxism|Marxists]] who were building their revolutionary organizations there.<ref name="Tracht5" /> Following his second trip, Riazanov was arrested in October 1891 at the Austrian-Russian border by the [[Okhrana]], the tsarist secret police, who had long suspected his revolutionary activity.<ref>Leckey, "David Riazanov and Russian Marxism," pg. 130.</ref> Riazanov spent 15 months in prison awaiting trial, at which he was convicted and sentenced to an additional four years of ''[[katorga]]'' (exile and hard labor).<ref name="Tracht5" /> Following completion of his term, Riazanov was subject to 3 years of administrative exile under police supervision in the city of [[Chișinău|Kishinev]], [[Bessarabia]] (today part of [[Moldova]]).<ref name="Longley">David Longley, "David Borisovich Riazanov" in A. Thomas Lane (ed.), ''Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders: M-Z.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995; pp. 804-805.</ref>

==First period of exile==
In 1900, Riazanov went into [[exile]]. The next year in [[Berlin]] Riazanov and his co-thinkers established a small Marxist group called "Borba" (Struggle), which attempted to unite the émigré Russian Marxists.<ref name="Longley" /> Riazanov's group was excluded from the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|2nd Congress]] of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] that was held in London and Brussels in the summer of 1903.<ref name="Day32-34">Richard B. Day and Daniel Gaido (eds.), ''Witnesses to Permanent Revolution: The Documentary Record.'' [2009] Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2011; pp. 32-34.</ref> With the party divided between [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] and [[Mensheviks|Menshevik]] wings in the aftermath of this landmark convention, Riazanov and his co-thinkers pointedly declined to join either faction.<ref name="Longley" />

In 1903, Riazanov became the first writer to introduce the concept of [[permanent revolution]] to the political literature of Russian Marxism when he published three studies in [[Geneva]] under the title ''Materials on the Program of the Workers' Party.''<ref name="Day32-34" /> Riazanov argued, in opposition to the views of [[Georgi Plekhanov]], that the rise of [[capitalism]] in Russia represented a fundamental departure from the pattern seen elsewhere in Europe. The large size and centralization of Russian industrial firms suggested to Riazanov a relative weakness of Russian middle-classes and a significant possibility that there would be forces of the Russian Marxist movement which would lead the revolution against [[Tsarist autocracy]] and thenceforth immediately towards [[socialism]].<ref name="Day32-34" />

Riazanov returned to Russia shortly after the start of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Russian Revolution]], going to work in the [[trade union]] movement in the capital city of [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref name="Tracht5" /> The uprising ended in failure by the revolutionaries, however, and Riazanov was arrested and sentenced to deportation once again in 1907.<ref name="Sou">Boris Souvarine, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/riazanov/bio/bio01.htm "D.B Riazonov,"] ''La Critique sociale,'' no. 2, July 1931, pp. 49-50.</ref>

==Second period of exile==
Shortly after his 1907 conviction, Riazanov emigrated to the West. During this second interlude abroad, Riazanov dedicated himself to historical scholarship, studying the history of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] in the archives of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social-Democratic Party]] and in the [[British Museum]] in London.<ref name="Tracht5" />

While in London, Riazanov read extensively from the files of the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' and other newspapers, collecting material written by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] for the periodical press.<ref name="Tracht6">Trachtenberg, "Introduction" to ''Karl Marx and Frederick Engels,'' pg. 6.</ref> This journalism of Marx and Engels which Riazanov so painstakingly gathered was eventually published in book form in 1917, a publication which cemented Riazanov's reputation as one of the world's leading experts in the literary output of these two leading lights of modern socialism.<ref name="Tracht6" />

During Riazanov's second period of exile he became a close political associate of [[Leon Trotsky]], contributing regularly to the latter's [[Vienna]] newspaper, ''Pravda.''<ref name="Longley" /> Riazanov actively supported Trotsky's [[Mezhraiontsy|Interdistrict Committee]] (the ''Mezhraionka''), a group which shared the [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] views of the Bolsheviks on the question of the war but which disagreed with them on organizational matters, seeking unity with revolutionary elements in the Menshevik camp.<ref>George Jackson and Robert Devlin (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Russian Revolution.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1989; pp. 347-348.</ref>

Riazanov was also a participant in the 1915 [[Zimmerwald Conference]] of the [[Second International]]. Riazanov rejected both the [[social patriotism|social-patriotic]] support of [[World War I]] advanced by many Western European socialists as well as the [[defeatism|revolutionary defeatism]] advanced by the Bolsheviks.<ref name="Longley" />

During the war, Riazanov lived in [[Paris]], where he was a frequent contributor to the Russian-language socialist newspapers ''Golos'' (The Voice) and ''[[Nashe Slovo]]'' (Our Word).<ref name="Hoover">Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition.'' Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pg. 398.</ref>

==After the 1917 revolution==

Riazanov returned to Russia following the [[February Revolution]] in 1917. There he was active in the growing [[trade union]] movement, helping to form the Russian Railway Union.<ref>Boris Souvarine, ''Stalin: A Critical Survey of Bolshevism.'' C.L.R. James, trans. New York: Alliance Book Corporation, 1939; pp. 191-192.</ref>

Together with the rest of the ''Mezhraiontsy,'' Riazanov joined the Bolshevik Party headed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] in August 1917.<ref name="Longley" /> Riazanov was opposed to the [[October Revolution]], however, and was instead involved in an effort to establish a broad coalition government.<ref name="Longley" /> In the same vein, Riazanov stood as an opponent of the Bolshevik decision to dissolve the elected [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] in January 1918.<ref name="Longley" />

In March 1918, the decision of the Bolsheviks to sign the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] prompted Riazanov to resign from the Bolshevik Party — a temporary move which was shortly reversed with a reapplication for membership and readmission.<ref name="Longley" />

In 1918, Riazanov helped to establish the Socialist Academy of Social Sciences, an institute later known as the [[Communist Academy]].<ref name="Longley" /> 
[[File:Brodskiy II Ryazanov.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Riazanov by [[Isaak Brodsky]]]]
In 1920 Riazanov attended the [[2nd World Congress of the Communist International|2nd World Congress]] of the [[Communist International]] as a member of the Russian delegation.<ref name="Hoover" />

Riazanov was an unorthodox member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]]. He attended the 4th All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions in May 1921, at which he spoke in favor of the independence of the unions from the Communist Party.<ref name="Med96">[[Roy Medvedev]], ''Let History Judge: The Origins and Consequences of Stalinism.'' George Shriver, trans. Revised Edition. New York: Columbia University Press, 1989; pg. 96.</ref> Working with Communist trade union leader [[Mikhail Tomsky]], Riazanov also authored a resolution calling for wages to be paid with physical commodities rather than the devalued currency of the day — an action which put the duo at odds with Lenin, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], and the party's Central Committee.<ref name="Med96" />

Radical French writer [[Boris Souvarine]] later lauded Riazanov's activity in this period as that of "a conscious marxist, a democratic communist, in other words, opposed to any dictatorship over the proletariat."<ref name="Sou" /> Riazanov's defense of trade union autonomy against the will of the party came at price, however, as Riazanov was effectively excluded from any active political responsibility after May 1921.<ref name="Longley" /> Thereafter he assumed the role of Marxist academic.

In 1921 Riazanov established the Marx-Engels Institute, which became one of the main institutions of [[Philosophy in the Soviet Union|Soviet philosophy]] and history.<ref name="Hoover" /> Riazanov dedicated himself especially to the [[Marxology|compilation and publication of the collected writings of Karl Marx]] and Friedrich Engels. In this context, as early as 1926, the publication of a multi-volume series called the ''Marx-Engels Archive'', collecting scholarship on the biography and writings of the founders of Marxism, began under Riazanov's supervision.<ref name="Tracht7">Trachtenberg, "Introduction" to ''Karl Marx and Frederick Engels,'' pg. 7.</ref> In 1927 the first volume of the ''[[Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe]]'' (''MEGA<sup>1</sup>'') was published by the Marx-Engels Institute, a complete edition of the works of Marx and Engels in their original languages, which was to comprise 42 volumes. Under Riazanov's editorship, five volumes of this edition were issued until 1931 (later seven more were published until the project was abandoned in the mid-1930s).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Musto |first1=Marcello |date=October 2008 |title=Marx in the Years of ''Herr Vogt'': Notes toward an Intellectual Biography (1860–1861); ''1. The Editorial Vicissitudes of Marx's and Engels' Works'' |journal=Science & Society |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=389–390 |doi=10.1521/siso.2008.72.4.389}}</ref> Moreover, starting in 1928, a first Russian edition of the collected works of Marx and Engels in 28 volumes (''Sochineniya<sup>1</sup>'') began being published, of which ten volumes were issued under Riazanov's direction until 1931 (vol. I–III, V–VIII, XXI–XXIII; the edition was largely completed in 1947).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hecker |first=Rolf |date=2001 |title=Die Herausgabe der ersten russischen Werkausgabe und des ''Marx-Engels-Archivs'' unter dem neuen Direktor |trans-title=The publication of the first Russian edition and the ''Marx-Engels Archive'' under the new director |language=German |journal=Beiträge zur Marx-Engels-Forschung. Neue Folge. Sonderband |volume=3 |pages=206–211}}</ref>

Riazanov also edited the works of other authors including [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. He was a member of the Commission for the Study of the October Revolution and of the Russian Communist Party, commonly known as ''[[Istpart]].''<ref name="Longley" />

In 1929, Riazanov was elected to the [[Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union]].<ref name="Longley" />

== Personality ==
[[Victor Serge]] described Riazonov as "stout, strong-featured, beard and moustache thick and white, attentive eyes, Olympian forehead, stormy temperament, ironic utterance..." and noted that "the leaders were a little afraid of his frank way of talking."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Serge |first1=Victor |title=Memoirs of a Revolutionary |date=1984 |publisher=Writer & Readers Co-Operative |location=London |isbn=0-86316-070-0 |pages=250–51}}</ref>

He undoubtedly had a 'frank way of talking'. The US journalist, William Reswick, heard a rumour in Moscow - which may be apocryphal - that Riazanov once told Stalin to his face: "You recite passages from Marx like a dull schoolboy without knowing what they mean."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reswick |first1=William |title=I Dreamt Revolution |date=1952 |publisher=Henry Regnery |location=Chicago |page=280 |url=https://archive.org/details/idreamtrevolutio006158mbp/page/n291/mode/2up |access-date=16 October 2022}}</ref> Even if it was untrue, the fact that the story was being repeated shows that he had a reputation for having a sharp tongue. Historian [[Isaac Deutscher]] recounted another episode at a party meeting in which he derided Stalin with the words "Stop it Koba, don't make a fool of yourself. Everybody knows that theory is not exactly your field".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutscher |first1=I. |title=Stalin a Political Biography |date=1961 |page=290 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkmjvA_EI2UC&q=Stop%20it%20,%20Koba%20,%20don%27t%20make%20a%20fool%20of%20yourself%20.%20Everybody%20knows%20that%20theory%20is%20not%20exactly%20your%20field%20%22 |language=en}}</ref>

In the same vein, [[György Lukács]] mentioned how Riazanov said to him, commenting on Lukács's falling-out with the [[Comintern]] in the late 1920s: "Ah-ha, you have been Cominterned."<ref>{{cite book|title=Record of a Life|page=88|year=1983|author=Lukács, György|publisher=Verso}}</ref>

Addressing the Eleventh Party Congress in March 1922, after he had effectively been banned from political activity, Riazonov claimed:

{{blockquote|They say that the English Parliament can do everything except change a man into a woman. Our [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] is far more powerful than that. It has already changed one not very revolutionary man into an old woman, and the number of these old women is increasing daily."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schapiro |first1=Leonard |title=The Origin of the Communist Autocracy - Political Opposition in the Soviet State: First Phase, 1917-1922 |date=1965 |publisher=Frederick A. Praeger |location=New York |pages=336–37}}</ref>|}}

==Persecution, death, and legacy==
In December 1930, [[Isaak Illich Rubin|Isaak Rubin]], a research assistant at the Marx-Engels Institute since 1926, was arrested by the Soviet secret police and charged with participation in a plot to establish an underground organization called the "Union Bureau of Mensheviks."<ref name="Medvedev280">Medvedev, ''Let History Judge,'' Revised Edition, pg. 280.</ref> As a lawyer, Rubin initially managed to avoid succumbing to false charges made by the interrogator, but he was nonetheless kept in custody and transferred to [[Suzdal]].<ref name="Medvedev280" />

In Suzdal, Rubin was subjected to a cramped punishment cell barely bigger than a man and to the torture of solitary confinement.<ref name="Medvedev281">Medvedev, ''Let History Judge,'' Revised Edition, pg. 281.</ref> With his health starting to fail, Rubin was eventually compelled to give false written testimony against David Riazanov to secret police des. Rubin claimed that he had kept an envelope containing secret documents of the mythical "Menshevik Center" in his office at the Marx-Engels Institute before discreetly passing them along to David Riazanov.<ref name="Medvedev282">Medvedev, ''Let History Judge,'' Revised Edition, pg. 282.</ref> Following a [[show trial]] conducted by prosecutor [[Nikolai Krylenko]], Rubin was found guilty of participation in the plot and sentenced to a 5-year term of imprisonment.<ref name="Medvedev282" /> This coerced testimony of Rubin was used in building a case against his former employer, David Riazanov.<ref>Medvedev, ''Let History Judge,'' Revised Edition, pg. 283.</ref>

With his name under a cloud of suspicion and with a [[show trial]] of the purported "Union Bureau of Mensheviks" in the offing, Riazanov was dismissed as director of the Marx-Engels Institute in February 1931.<ref name="Longley"/>

Soon after the completion of the March trial of the Union Bureau — the so-called [[1931 Menshevik Trial]] — with his name besmirched by false testimony,<ref>In 1999 the transcripts of written statements to the secret police gathered in preparation for the 1931 Menshevik Trial were published in two volumes, including the accusations made against Riazanov by I.I. Rubin, V.V. Sher, and others. See: A.L. Litvin (ed.), ''Men'shevistskii protsess 1931 goda: Sbornik dokumentov v 2-kh knigakh.'' (The Menshevik Trial of 1931: Collection of Documents in 2 Volumes.) Moscow: ROSSPEN, 1999.</ref> Riazanov was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested by the secret police,<ref>Medvedev, ''Let History Judge,'' Revised Edition, pg. 292.</ref> ostensibly "for helping Menshevik counter-revolutionary activity."<ref name="Hoover" />

Following his arrest Riazanov was not sent to the labor camps of the [[Gulag]], but was instead subjected to administrative deportation to the city of [[Saratov]].<ref name="Tucker">Robert C. Tucker, ''Stalin in Power: The Revolution from Above, 1928-1941.'' New York: W.W. Norton, 1990; pp. 170-171.</ref> In Saratov, Riazanov worked for the next six years in the [[Saratov State University|Saratov University]] library.<ref name="Day70">Day and Gaido (eds.), ''Witnesses to Permanent Revolution,'' pg. 70.</ref> Riazanov's Marx-Engels Institute was consolidated with the Lenin Institute later in 1931 to form the Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute, under the direction of [[Vladimir Adoratsky]].<ref name="Tucker" />

During the [[Great Purge|Yezhovshchina]] of 1937, Riazanov was again arrested, this time as a purported member of a "right-opportunist Trotskyist organisation."<ref name="Day70" /> On 21 January 1938, following a perfunctory trial, the [[Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union|Military Collegium of the USSR Supreme Court]] condemned Riazanov to death and he was executed later that same day.<ref name="Day70" />

Riazanov was [[rehabilitation (Soviet)|posthumously rehabilitated]] in 1958.<ref name="Day70" /> He was further rehabilitated in political terms in 1989 as part of the ''[[glasnost]]'' campaign of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref name="Day70" />

According to historian Colum Leckey, David Riazanov's chief achievement lay in the realm of [[Marxology]] — acquiring, preparing, and publishing for the first time previously unknown writings of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels.<ref name="Leckey134-135">Leckey, "David Riazanov and Russian Marxism," pp. 134-135.</ref> Included among these were the works ''[[The German Ideology]]'', sections of ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'', ''[[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'' and ''[[Dialectics of Nature]].''<ref name="Leckey134-135" />
