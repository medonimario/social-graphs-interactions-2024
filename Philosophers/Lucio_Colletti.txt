'''Lucio Colletti'''{{efn|Italian pronunciation: {{IPA|it|ˈluːtʃo kolˈletti|}}.}} (8 December 1924 &ndash; 3 November 2001) was an Italian [[Western Marxist]] philosopher. Colletti started to be known outside Italy because of a long interview with him that [[Marxist historian]] [[Perry Anderson]] published in the ''[[New Left Review]]'' in 1974.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Colletti | first = Lucio | title = A political and philosophical interview | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = I | issue = 86 | publisher = New Left Review | date = July–August 1974 | url = https://newleftreview.org/I/86/lucio-colletti-a-political-and-philosophical-interview }}</ref>

==Biography==
Colletti studied philosophy at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]], where he earned a ''[[laurea]]'' with a thesis entitled ''La logica di Benedetto Croce'' (''The Logic of [[Benedetto Croce]]''), which was supervised by {{ill|Carlo Antoni|it}}.<ref>[[Martin Jay]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=B1IN1QmMxngC&dq=lucio+colletti+Carlo+Antoni&pg=PA444 Marxism and Totality: The Adventures of a Concept from Lukács to Habermas]'', University of California Press, 1984, p. 444. {{ISBN|9780520057425}}.</ref> Inspired by the [[Western Marxist]] philosopher [[Galvano Della Volpe]], he then gravitated towards [[communism]].<ref>Stella Gian Antonio, ''[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2000/luglio/01/COLLETTI_pifferaio_rosso_della_Volpe_co_0_0007013004.shtml Colletti. Il pifferaio rosso della Volpe]'', ''Corriere della Sera'', 1 July 2000, p. 33.</ref> Colletti was well known as a critic of [[Hegelian idealism]] and later became a noted critic of [[Marxism]]. He wrote the foreword for the Italian edition of [[Alfred Schmidt (philosopher)|Alfred Schmidt]]'s ''[[The Concept of Nature in Marx]]''.<ref>[[Alfred Schmidt (philosopher)|Alfred Schmidt]]: ''Il concetto di natura in Marx.'' Translated by Giorgio Baratta and Giuseppe Bedeschi. Pref. Lucio Colletti. 2nd ed. Bari: Laterza, 1973.</ref>

Colletti changed his political beliefs very often and abandoned many of his early Marxist ideals. Having been a member of the anti-fascist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] (''Partito d'Azione''; PdA) in his youth, he joined the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) in 1949 and emerged as an important cultural party figure.<ref>Sarti, Roland. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xhoLorFC1iwC&pg=PA208 ''Italy: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present'']. New York : Facts On File, 2004: 208.</ref> In 1964, Coletti left the PCI because the party's break with its semi-[[Stalinist]] past was leading towards what he called, in his view, a "patently rightward direction."<ref>Jay, M. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B1IN1QmMxngC&pg=PA429 ''Marxism and Totality: The Adventures of a Concept from Lukács to Habermas'']. Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 1984: 429.</ref> In the 1970s he was among the supporters of Socialist leader [[Bettino Craxi]]. From 1996 until his death he was elected on the list of [[Forza Italia]], [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[right-wing]] political party, as a member of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] (lower house) in the Italian parliament.
