==Biography==
Moses Hess was born in [[Bonn]],<ref name="Silberner 1966" /> which was under French rule at the time.

He married a poor [[Catholic]] seamstress, Sibylle Pesch, "in order to redress the injustice perpetrated by society". Although they remained happily married until Hess' death,<ref name="Berlin 1957" /> Sibylle may have had an affair with [[Friedrich Engels]] while he was smuggling her from Belgium to France to be reunited with her husband. Sibylle, however, claimed the relationship was non-consensual and accused Engels of rape.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hunt |first=Tristram |title=The Frock-Coated Communist: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels |publisher=Metropolitan/Henry Holt & Co |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8050-8025-4}}</ref> The incident may have precipitated Hess' split from the communist movement.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Henderson |first=William Otto |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eYXc1B1vPoC&q=Friedrich+Engels+Sybille+Pesch&pg=PA89 |title=The Life of Friedrich Engels |date=1976 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-7146-4002-0 |language=en}}</ref>

Hess was an early proponent of [[socialism]], and a precursor to what would later be called [[Zionism]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Battegay, Lubrich |first=Caspar, Naomi |title=Jewish Switzerland: 50 Objects Tell Their Stories |publisher=Christophe Merian |year=2018 |isbn=9783856168476 |pages=126–129 |language=de, en}}</ref> As a correspondent for the ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'', a radical newspaper founded by liberal Rhenish businessmen, he lived in Paris.

Marx, Engels and Hess took refuge in Brussels, Belgium, in 1845, and used to live in the same street.

Hess fled to [[Switzerland]] temporarily following the suppression of the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 commune]]. He would also go abroad during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–1871. During the 1850s Hess immersed himself into studying the natural sciences and gaining, in an autodidactic fashion, a scientific foundation for his thoughts.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Daum |first=Andreas W. |author-link=Andreas W.

Hess died in Paris in 1875. As he requested, he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of [[Cologne]]. In 1961, he was re-interred in the [[Kvutzat Kinneret|Kinneret]] Cemetery in Israel along with other [[Labor Zionism|Socialist-Zionists]] such as [[Nachman Syrkin]], [[Ber Borochov]], and [[Berl Katznelson]].

[[Moshav]] [[Kfar Hess]] was named in his honour.

==Views and opinions==
Hess became reluctant to base all history on economic causes and [[class struggle]] (as Marx and Engels did), and he came to see the struggle of races, or nationalities, as the prime factor of history.

According to [[George Lichtheim]], Hess, who differed from Marx on a number of issues, still testified in a letter to [[Alexander Herzen]] that what he and Herzen were writing about "resembles a neat sketch drawn on paper, whereas Marx's judgment upon these events [European upheavals] is as it were engraved with iron force in the rock of time" (Paraphrased by George Lichtheim, ''A Short History of Socialism'', 1971 p.&nbsp;80).

From 1861 to 1863, he lived in Germany, where he became acquainted with the rising tide of German [[antisemitism]]. It was then that he reverted to his Jewish name Moses (after going by Moritz Hess)<ref name="Berlin 1957"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Moses-Hess|title=Moses Hess: German author and Zionist|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|date=2 April 2024 }}</ref> in protest against [[Jewish assimilation]]. He published ''[[s:Rome and Jerusalem|Rome and Jerusalem]]'' in 1862. Hess interprets history as a circle of [[Ethnic nationalism|race]] and national struggles. He contemplated the rise of [[Italian nationalism]] and the German reaction to it, and from this he arrived at the idea of Jewish national revival, and at his prescient understanding that the Germans would not be tolerant of the national aspirations of others and would be particularly intolerant of the Jews. His book calls for the establishment of a Jewish socialist commonwealth in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], in line with the emerging national movements in Europe and as the only way to respond to antisemitism and assert Jewish identity in the modern world.

==Scholarly work==
Hess's ''[[Rome and Jerusalem: The Last National Question]]'' went unnoticed in his time, as most German Jews preferred [[cultural assimilation]]. His work did not stimulate political activity or discussion.  When [[Theodor Herzl]] first read ''Rome and Jerusalem'' he wrote that "since [[Spinoza]] Jewry had no bigger thinker than this forgotten Moses Hess." He said he might not have written {{lang|de|Der Judenstaat}} (''The Jewish State'') if he had known ''Rome and Jerusalem'' beforehand. [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky|Vladimir Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] honored Hess in ''The Jewish Legion in the World War'' as one of the people that made the [[Balfour Declaration|Balfour declaration]] possible, along with Herzl, [[Walter Rothschild]] and [[Leon Pinsker]].
