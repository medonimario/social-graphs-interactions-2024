==Biography==

===Clinic of La Borde===
Guattari was born in [[Villeneuve-les-Sablons]], a working-class suburb of northwest Paris, France.<ref>Guattari (1989, ix).</ref> His father was a factory manager and he was engaged in [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] political activism as a teenager, before studying and training under (and being analyzed by) the French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] in the early 1950s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shatz|first=Adam|date=2010|title=Desire was everywhere. Review of Dosse F. 2010, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. Intersecting Lives. Columbia, translated by Deborah Glassman|journal=London Review of Books|volume=32|issue=24}}</ref> Subsequently, he worked all his life at the experimental psychiatric clinic of [[La Borde clinic|La Borde]] under the direction of Lacan's pupil, the psychiatrist [[Jean Oury]]. He first met Oury at a private psychiatric clinic in Saumery in the [[Loire|Loire region]] at the suggestion of Oury's brother Fernand, who had been Guattari's high school teacher. Guattari followed Oury to La Borde in 1955, two years after it had been established.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robcis|first=Camille|title=Disalienation. Politics, Philosophy and Radical Psychiatry in Postwar France|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2021|location=Chicago|pages=75–77}}</ref> La Borde was a venue for conversation among many students of philosophy, psychology, [[ethnology]], and social work.

One particularly novel orientation developed at La Borde consisted of the suspension of the classical analyst/analysand pair in favour of an open confrontation in [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]]. In contrast to the [[Freud's psychoanalytic theories|Freudian school]]'s individualistic style of analysis, this practice studied the dynamics of several subjects in complex interaction. It led Guattari into a broader philosophical exploration of, and political engagement with, a vast array of intellectual and cultural domains (philosophy, [[ethnology]], linguistics, architecture, etc.).

===1960s–1970s===
From 1955 to 1965 Guattari edited and contributed to ''La Voie Communiste'' (''Communist Way''), a [[Trotskyist]] newspaper.<ref>Guattari (1989, x).</ref> He supported [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialist struggles]] as well as the [[Autonomia Operaia|Italian Autonomists]]. Guattari also took part in the G.T.P.S.I., which gathered many psychiatrists at the beginning of the 1960s and created the Association of Institutional Psychotherapy in November 1965. It was at the same time that he founded, along with other militants, the F.G.E.R.I. (Federation of Groups for Institutional Study & Research) and its review ''Recherche'' (''Research''), working on philosophy, psychoanalysis, ethnology, education, mathematics, architecture, etc. The F.G.E.R.I. came to represent aspects of the multiple political and cultural engagements of Guattari: the Group for Young Hispanics, the Franco-Chinese Friendships (in the times of the [[people's commune]]s), the opposition activities with the wars in [[Algerian War of Independence|Algeria]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], the participation in the M.N.E.F., with the U.N.E.F., the policy of the offices of psychological academic aid (B.A.P.U.), the organization of the University Working Groups (G.T.U.), but also the reorganizations of the training courses with the Centers of Training to the Methods of Education Activities (C.E.M.E.A.) for psychiatric male nurses, as well as the formation of a Fellowship of Nurses (Amicales d'infirmiers) (in 1958), the studies on architecture and the projects of construction of a day hospital for "students and young workers".

In 1967 he appeared as one of the founders of OSARLA (Organization of solidarity and Aid to the Latin-American Revolution). In 1968, Guattari met [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Jean-Jacques Lebel]], and [[Julian Beck]]. He was involved in the large-scale [[May 1968 in France|French protests of May 1968]], starting from the [[Movement of 22 March]]. It was in the aftermath of 1968 that Guattari met [[Gilles Deleuze]] at the [[University of Vincennes]]. Then he began to lay the groundwork for ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), which [[Michel Foucault]] described as "an introduction to the non-fascist life" in his preface to the book. In 1970, he created {{ill|Center for the Study and Research of Institutional Formation|fr|CERFI}}), which developed the approach explored in the ''Recherches'' journal. In 1973, Guattari was tried and fined for committing an "outrage to public decency" for publishing an issue of ''Recherches'' on homosexuality.<ref>{{cite book |author=Massumi, Brian |title=A User's Guide to Capitalism and Schizophrenia: Deviations from Deleuze and Guattari |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1993 |page=[https://archive.org/details/usersguidetocapi00mass/page/144 144] |isbn=0-262-63143-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/usersguidetocapi00mass/page/144 }}</ref> In 1977, he created the CINEL for "new spaces of freedom" before joining the [[environmental movement]] with his "[[ecosophy]]" in the 1980s.

===1980s to 1990s===
[[File:Tombeau guattari.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Grave of Guattari at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], Paris]]
Guattari viewed the primary commodity produced under capitalism as subjectivity itself.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Simpson |first=Tim |title=Betting on Macau: Casino Capitalism and China's Consumer Revolution |date=2023 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |isbn=978-1-5179-0031-1 |series=Globalization and Community series |location=Minneapolis, MN}}</ref>{{Rp|page=254}} According to Guattari, producing consuming subjects with novel desires satisfiable through continuing purchase of commodities and experiences is the precondition to creating a consumer society.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=254}}

In his last book, ''Chaosmosis'' (1992), Guattari returned to the question of subjectivity: "How to produce it, collect it, enrich it, reinvent it permanently in order to make it compatible with mutant Universes of value?" This concern runs through all of his works, from ''Psychoanalysis and Transversality'' (a collection of articles from 1957 to 1972), through ''Years of Winter'' (1980–1986) and ''Schizoanalytic Cartographies'' (1989), to his collaboration with Deleuze, ''[[What is Philosophy? (Deleuze and Guattari)|What is Philosophy?]]'' (1991). In ''Chaosmosis'', Guattari proposes an analysis of subjectivity in terms of four functors: (1) material, energetic, and semiotic fluxes; (2) concrete and abstract machinic [[Phylum|phyla]]; (3) [[Virtual (philosophy)|virtual]] universes of value; and (4) finite existential territories.<ref>Guattari (1992, 124).</ref> This scheme attempts to grasp the heterogeneity of components involved in the production of subjectivity, as Guattari understands it, which include both signifying [[Semiotics|semiotic]] components as well as "a-signifying [[Semiology|semiological]] dimensions" (which work "in parallel or independently of" any signifying function that they may have).<ref>Guattari (1992, 4).</ref>

=== Death and posthumous publications ===
On 29 August 1992, two weeks after an interview for the [[Television in Greece|Greek television]] curated by [[Yiorgos Veltsos]],<ref>"[http://www.revue-chimeres.fr/drupal_chimeres/?q=node/267 Entretien avec Félix Guattari à la télévision grecque] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309165812/http://www.revue-chimeres.fr/drupal_chimeres/?q=node%2F267 |date=2016-03-09 }}" ("Felix Guattari interview on Greek television"), ''Revue Chimères'', 4 February 2009 (in French)</ref> Guattari died in [[La Borde clinic|La Borde]] from a heart attack.<ref name=kirkup>"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-felix-guattari-1548642.html Obituary: Felix Guattari]" by [[James Kirkup]], ''[[The Independent]]'', 31 August 1992</ref><ref name=riding>"[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/03/arts/felix-guattari-a-psychoanalyst-and-philospher-is-dead-at-62.html Felix Guattari, a Psychoanalyst And {{sic|Philospher,|nolink=y}} Is Dead at 62]" by [[Alan Riding]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 3 September 1992</ref>

In 1995, the posthumous release of Guattari's ''Chaosophy'' published essays and interviews concerning Guattari's work as director of the experimental [[La Borde clinic]] and his collaborations with Deleuze. The collection includes essays such as "Balance-Sheet Program for Desiring Machines," cosigned by Deleuze (with whom he had coauthored ''Anti-Oedipus'' and ''A Thousand Plateaus''), and "Everybody Wants To Be a Fascist." It provides an introduction to Guattari's theories on "[[schizoanalysis]]", a process that develops [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]] but which pursues a more experimental and collective approach towards analysis.

In 1996, another collection of Guattari's essays, lectures, and interviews, ''Soft Subversions'', was published, which traces the development of his thought and activity throughout the 1980s ("the winter years"). His analyses of art, cinema, youth culture, economics, and power formations, develop concepts such as "micropolitics," "schizoanalysis," and "becoming-woman," which aim to liberate subjectivity and open up new horizons for political and creative resistance to the standardizing and homogenizing processes of global capitalism (which he calls "Integrated World Capitalism") in the "post-media era." For example, he used the term "micropolitics" to delimit a certain level of observation of social practices (the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious economy]], where there is a certain flexibility in the expression of desire and institution) and, practically, to define, in a [[Geographical segregation|segregated world]], the field of intervention of "people who work to interest themselves in the [[discourse]] of [[Other (philosophy)|the other]]."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teVWAAAAYAAJ|title=Micropolitiques|last1=Guattari|first1=Félix|last2=Rolnik|first2=Suely|date=2007|publisher=Empêcheurs de Penser en Rond|isbn=9782846711586|language=fr}}</ref>
