Marulić scholar [[Bratislav Lučin]] notes that he was well-versed in both the [[Christian Bible]] and in the [[Fathers of the Church]]. At the same time, Marulić also attentively read the Pre-Christian Greek and Latin [[Classics]]. He read and interpreted Latin [[epigram]]s, wrote glosses on the [[erotic poetry]] of [[Catullus]], read [[Petronius]]' ''[[Satyricon]]'', and admired [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]. Marulić also composed humanist elegies, [[satirical poetry]], erotic epigrams<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]].

Pages 130-148.</ref>

According to Franz Posset, Marulić aspired to the Renaissance humanist ideal of the ''uomo universale'' ("universal man"). To this end, he was interested in painting and drawing, local and national history, languages, and poetry. His overall goal always remained ''renovatio Christiana'' ("The Renewal of Christianity") as represented by the future [[Counter-Reformation]]. Accordingly, like many other Renaissance humanists who shared his views, Marulić denounced [[simony]] and immorality among [[Roman Catholic priest]]s and members of the hierarchy in often violent language throughout his writings.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page 35.</ref>

Although Marulić and [[Martin Luther]] lived at the same time and were published by two of the same [[Basel]] printers, their collected writings make no mention of each other. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it must be assumed that both theologians were simply unaware of the other's existence. At the same time, both men shared a common belief in ''Evangelica Veritas'' ("Gospel Truth") and "theology for piety". They both built their differing theology upon the similar training they received in [[scholasticism]], [[Renaissance humanism]], and ''[[Devotio Moderna]]''. Like fellow Renaissance humanists [[Johann Reuchlin]], [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]], [[Thomas More]], [[John Fisher]], [[Juan Luis Vives]], and [[Paolo Riccio]], however, Marko Marulić remained committed to an internal renewal of [[Roman Catholicism]] and loyal to the [[Holy See]], while Martin Luther and his adherents did not.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page 26.</ref>

Marulić's work was admired both by many of the greatest and most influential Catholic saints of the Counter-Reformation<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page ''x''.</ref> and also, since much of Marulić could be read without violating ''[[sola scriptura]]'', by generations of believers in [[Protestantism]].<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page ''xii''.</ref>

His writings in [[Renaissance Latin]], once adored and envied across Europe, shared the destiny that befell most Renaissance Humanist literature and faded into obscurity.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010212024749/http://www.moderna-vremena.hr/vrem/marul.asp Moderna Vremena i Marko Marulić]  – Retrieved on  28 November 2008.</ref> According to Lučin, however, the passage of time has slowly revealed the important web of influence that the poet and writer wove all over Europe and far beyond its borders. Marulić's writings were admired by churchmen such as Saints [[Francis Xavier]], [[Francis de Sales]], [[Peter Canisius]], and [[Charles Borromeo]], by monarchs and statesmen such as [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], Thomas More, and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Carl V]], emulated by poets like [[Jan Dantyszek]], [[Conrad Peutinger]], and [[Francisco de Quevedo]],<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]].

One of Marulić's books published in the 1510s is also the first time a literary work used the term "[[psychology]]". More recently, [[Pope John Paul II]] quoted from a Marulić poem during his 1998 apostolic visit to [[Solin, Croatia]].<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]].

==Biography==
Marulić was born on 18 August 1450 into the [[Croatian nobility]] in [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Dalmatia]]. He was the first of seven children. <ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page 33.</ref> The palazzo in which he was born still stands on Papalić Street in Split.<ref> [https://visitsplit.com/en/2540/european-fame-and-forbidden-love-of-marko-marulic European Fame and Forbidden Love of Marko Marulić] </ref> His father, Nikola Marulić, was descended from the Pečenić family (''Pecinić'', ''Picinić'', Pezzini in [[Italian language|Italian]]). Marulić came from a [[15th century]] branch of the family whose founder was named Petar, and who only began calling themselves Marulić, ''Marulus'' or  ''De Marulis'', in the 15th century.<ref name="Marulianum" /> His mother, Dobrica de Albertis, was a member of the [[Italian nobility]].<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page 33.</ref>

Very little is known about his life, and the few facts that remain are often unreliable. It is certain that he attended a school in Split run by the Italian Renaissance humanist scholar Tideo Acciarini (1430–1490). Marulić's education is known also to have included instruction in the [[Greek language]] by Hieronymus Genesius Picentinus. Although his library later contained many textbooks on the language, Marulić read and spoke it imperfectly and only rarely used Greek words.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Pages 33–34.</ref>

After completing school, Marulić is believed to have studied law at [[Padua University]], after which he spent much of his life in his home town. His star-crossed love affair with a Split noblewoman ended when her father, the commander of the city's Venetian military garrison, allegedly [[live burial|buried her alive]]. A grieving Marulić lived for about two years as a [[postulant]] at a [[monastery]] on the island of [[Šolta]], in the [[Adriatic Sea]].<ref> [https://visitsplit.com/en/2540/european-fame-and-forbidden-love-of-marko-marulic European Fame and Forbidden Love of Marko Marulić] </ref> Returning to Split, Marulić practiced law, serving as a [[judge]], examiner of notarial entries and executor of wills. Owing to his work, he became the most distinguished member of Split's humanist circle.

Marulić's ''Evangelistarium'' ("Evangelistary"), a moral and theological compendium of Old and New Testament texts, was first published in 1487. The book was later republished by [[Italian Jew]]ish publisher [[Gershom Soncino]] at [[Pisa]] and a copy of that edition was purchased by the German humanist scholar and [[Hebraist]] [[Johann Reuchlin]] in 1492.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page 17.</ref> In 1519, another edition of the "Evangelistary" was published by [[Sebastian Münster]].<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page 20.</ref>

Between 1496 and 1499, Marulić worked on a compendium of [[Christian morality]], entitled ''De institutione bene vivendi per exempla sanctorum'' ("Instruction on How to Lead a Virtuous Life Based on the Examples of Saints").<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Pages 8–9.</ref> According to [[Latinist]] and [[Classicist]] Edward Mulholland, Marulic's primary model for ''De institutione'' was the ''Memorable Deeds and Sayings'' of [[Valerius Maximus]]. Maximus had intended in the writing of his book, "to spare those who want to learn the lessons of history the trouble of prolonged researches" and accordingly organized the nine books of his volume, "to illustrate a particular virtue or vice", and it became a widely used textbook in Medieval and Renaissance Europe, both of [[rhetoric]] and as, "a gallery of practical moral instruction."<ref>Marulić (2024), p. 12.</ref>

In addition to Old and New Testament examples,<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Pages 8–9.</ref> Marulić also drew upon the writings of [[St Jerome]], [[Gregory the Great]], [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[John Cassian]], the lives of the saints, and other Ecclesiastical writers.<ref> Ante Kadič, ''St Francis Xavier and Marko Marulić'', "[[The Slavic and Eastern European Journal]]", Spring 1961, pp. 12–18.</ref>

Marulić's ''De institutione'' was first published in Latin at [[Venice]] in 1507 and became well known in the [[Germanosphere]] when [[Adam Petri]] reprinted it at Basel in 1513. The compendium was widely and repeatedly reprinted and translated into many [[vernacular]] languages, which established Marulić's fame throughout Europe.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Pages 8–9.</ref>

Occasionally Marulić visited Venice (to trade) and [[Rome]] (to celebrate the year 1500).

According to his friend and early biographer Franjo Božičević, "for nearly forty years he sweated, shut up with the [[Muses]], in divine volumes, nocturnal study, vigils, [[fasting]], a [[hair shirt]], prayers and [[Discipline (instrument of penance)|rough flogging]]s, not without [[Mortification in Catholic theology|harsh penance]] day and night."<ref>Marulić (2024), p. 18.</ref>

He was a great admirer of the late medieval religious movement known as ''[[Devotio Moderna]]''. By 1509, Marulić had finished translating [[Thomas à Kempis]]' ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'', a highly important literary and devotional work of the movement, from Medieval Latin into Croatian. His translation, however, remained unpublished until 1989.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Pages 3–4.</ref> 

His friend and fellow humanist Dmine Papalić found an old volume of [[local history]] composed in the [[Illyrian (South Slavic)|Illyrian language]] and in the [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]]. At his friend's urging, Marulić both paraphrased and translated the volume into Latin as ''Regum Dalmatiae et Croatiae gesta'' ("The Deeds of the Kings of Dalmatia and Croatia"), as he completed ''Quinquaginta parabole'' ("Fifty Parables"), which is, according to Edward Mulholland, "Modeled after the [[parable]]s of the [[New Testament]], they consist in moral lessons in elegant Latin prose drawn from simple stories".<ref>Marulić (2024), p. 14-15.</ref> Both books were first published in 1510. He finished writing ''The Life of St. Jerome'' in 1513.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page ''xxix''.</ref> The following year, he completed ''Carmen de doctrina Domini nostri Iesu Christi pendentis in cruce'' ("Poem about the Teaching of Our Lord Jesus Christ Hanging on the Cross"), which has usually been published as part of ''De institutione bene vivendi'' and which remains his most famous work of Christian poetry in Latin.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page 9.</ref> 

In 1517, Marulić finished his epic poem the ''[[Davidiad]]'', which was considered lost for more than 400 years, only rediscovered in 1952, and published for the first time in 1954.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page ''xxx''.</ref> 

Similarly to both Catholic and Protestant humanists of the same era, Marulić used ''The Davidiad'' to preach a multilayered interpretation of the Old Testament, as pre-figuring the foundation of [[Christianity]] through the later events described in the [[New Testament]].<ref>Marulić (2024), pp 30-33.</ref> For example, Marulić compared [[David]] to [[Jesus Christ]], King [[Saul]] to [[Caiaphas]], the [[Pharisees]], and the [[Sanhedrin]], while comparing [[Goliath]] to [[Devil in Christianity|the Devil]].<ref>Marulić (2024), p. 33.</ref> Marulić also used his description of David and his warriors eating the [[Showbread|Bread of the Presence]] while fleeing from King Saul an opportunity to praise the Catholic doctrine of the [[Real Presence]] in the [[Blessed Sacrament]].<ref>Marulić (2024), pp. 24-26.</ref> Furthermore, Marulić's study of the [[Hebrew language]] was just as often on display in the ''Davidiad''; as, despite the difficulties he routinely faced in fitting Hebrew words into the rhythm of Latin [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]]ic [[hexameter]], he regularly made humorous comments about how very well the [[etymology]] of Hebrew personal names fit the character or appearance of their bearers.<ref>Marulić (2024), pp. 29-30.</ref>

According to Edward Mulholland, "Most early modern poets chose as their heroes either ancient historical characters - [[Petrarch]]'s ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'' (written 1339-43, first published in [[Venice]] in 1501) on the [[Second Punic War]] showing the lead - or medieval figures such as [[Charlemagne]] in [[Ugolino Verino]]'s ''Carlias'' (1480), or, most frequently, contemporary rulers. Marulić was the very first author to write a Neo-Latin Biblical poem, and he would remain unique in having found his inspiration in the [[Old Testament]]. Though certainly a Dalmatian patriot, Marulić did not choose to write a [[national epic]]. He is retelling the Biblical story first and foremost, but from the fullness of his multifaceted persona as, in Baumann's words, 'a Croat, a humanist, a conservative Catholic, an intellectual and a patrician of Split."<ref>Marulić (2024), p. 22.</ref> 

Marulić wrote ''De humilitate et gloria Christi'' ("On the Humility and Glory of Christ") and ''An Account of Illustrious Men of the Old Testament'' the following year.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page ''xxx''.</ref> 

His final works were ''De ultimo Christi judicio'' ("On the Last Judgment of Christ") and ''[[Judita]]'', Marulić's [[Christian poetry|Christian work]] of epic poetry retelling the ''[[Book of Judith]]'' in the Croatian language, which he produced between 1520 and 1522.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page ''xxx''.</ref> The latter, which also drew very heavily upon the [[Italian poetry]] of [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Petrarch]],<ref>Marulić (2024), pp. 14-15.</ref> earned Marulić the title "Father of [[Croatian literature]]."<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page ''xxx''.</ref>

Upon completing the poem on 22 April, which is still celebrated in Croatia as [[National Book Day]] ([[:hr:Dan hrvatske knjige|hr]]),<ref> [https://nsk.hr/en/blog-en/croatian-book-day/ Croatian National Book Day], National Library of Croatia.</ref> Marulic wrote to a friend, "See it and you will say that the [[Slavic languages|Slavonic language]] also has its Dante."<ref>Marulić (2024), p. 14.</ref>

Marko Marulić died in Split on 5 January 1524 and was buried in the Church of St. Francis in the historic city center.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page ''xxx''.</ref>

Marulić's ''Liber de laudibus Herculis'' ("A Book in Praise of Hercules"), in which he, "lets the followers of [[Hercules]], the titan of the pagans, compete with the titan of the Christians, that is, Jesus Christ, who, of course, is ultimately the victor", was posthumously published in 1524. It is also known under the title ''Dialogus de Hercule a Christicolis superato'' ("The Dialogue about Hercules, Who was Surpassed by Those Who Worship Christ").<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page ''xxx'', 35.</ref>

According to Edward Mulholland, "In it he makes the argument that one who has conquered beasts and monsters, as Hercules did, is not as strong as one who has mastered himself, which is the ideal of every Christian. But Marulić also shares his thoughts on the use of mythology and epic. The dialogue is between a theologian and a poet. The question underlying the dialogue seems to be which way is the most secure to arrive at the truth... For Marulic, as Elisabeth von Erdmann points out, pagan myth and poetry gained a certain legitimacy when employed in the service of theology."<ref>Marulić (2024), p. 16-17.</ref>

== Legacy ==
During the 16th and 17th century, Marulić's three most popular and most widely read works were ''De institutione bene vivendi per exempla sanctorum'' ("Instruction on How to Lead a Virtuous Life Based on the Examples of Saints"), ''Evangelistarium'' ("Evangelistary"), and ''Quinquaginta parabole'' ("Fifty Parables"). By 1680, these three books had been republished more than eighty times not only in the original Latin, but also in many European vernacular languages, including [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Castilian Spanish|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Flemish language|Flemish]], and even [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page ''x''.</ref> For this reason, Marulić is considered one of the most dynamic and influential theological and devotional writers of the Renaissance.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page 26.</ref> 

[[The British Library]] still has [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]'s Latin-language copy of Marulić's ''Evangelistiarium'', a book that was read in English and recommended to the King by Sir [[Thomas More]]. Extensive margin notes in the King's own hand prove that Marulić's book was a major source for the ''[[Defence of the Seven Sacraments]]'', Henry's polemic against [[Lutheranism]].<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page 18.</ref>

''De institutione bene vivendi per exempla sanctorum'' ("Instruction on How to Lead a Virtuous Life Based on the Examples of Saints"), a voluminous book of [[Christian morality]] based on examples from the Bible and concluding with the Latin poem ''Carmen de doctrina Domini nostri Iesu Christi pendentis in cruce'' ("Poem about the Teaching of Our Lord Jesus Christ Hanging on the Cross"), was first published in 1506 in Venice. 
The final poem, which remains Marulić's most famous work of Latin [[Christian poetry]], was published separately in a standalone volume at [[Erfurt]] by the [[Renaissance humanism in Northern Europe|German Renaissance humanist]] and [[Cistercian]] abbot [[Henricus Urbanus]] in 1514.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page ''xii''.</ref>

''De Institutione'' was seen by Roman Catholic priests during the [[Counter-Reformation]] as a rich source of stories for use during their preaching and was "considered the work most useful for Catholics in the defense of their ancestral Faith." ''De Institutione'' is further known to have had an enormous influence upon [[St Francis Xavier]]; it was the only book, aside from the [[Roman Breviary]], that he carried with him and constantly re-read during his missionary work in [[Portuguese India]].<ref name="Zubrinic"/> St. Francis Xavier's copy of the book was returned to Spain after his death and was long treasured in [[Madrid]] as a second class [[relic]] by the [[Society of Jesus]]. Writing in 1961, Marulic scholar [[Ante Kadič]] announced that recent inquiries about the volume had come up empty and that he believed the Saint's copy must have been destroyed during the [[Burning of convents in Spain (1931)|May 1931 arson attack]] by [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republicans]] against the Jesuit monastery in Madrid.<ref> Ante Kadič, ''St Francis Xavier and Marko Marulić'', "[[The Slavic and Eastern European Journal]]", Spring 1961, pp. 12–18.</ref> Further research, however, will be needed to determine whether excerpts from ''De institutione'' were translated into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] by [[Paul Yôhô-ken]] (1510–1599) and his son and published at [[Nagasaki]] by the Jesuits as ''Sanctos no go-sagyô no uchi nukigakkan dai-ichi'' ("Extracts from the Acts of the Saints") in 1591.<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page ''xxix''.</ref>

Due to Marulic having taken a stance in the fourth chapter of the ''Instituto'' in favour of the then controversial ethical doctrine of [[mental reservation]], namely, "that lying may sometimes be licit, although always undesirable", the same volume was temporarily placed upon the [[Index of Forbidden Books]] and [[book burning|copies were burned]] at [[Siena]] in 1564.<ref>Marulić (2024), p. 13.</ref>

While imprisoned for [[recusancy]] in the [[Tower of London]] under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], [[Philip Howard, 13th Earl of Arundel|St. Philip Howard]], who was later canonized in 1970 by [[Pope Paul VI]] as one of the [[Forty Martyrs of England and Wales]], wrote a translation into [[Elizabethan English]] verse of Marulić's poem ''Carmen de doctrina Domini nostri Iesu Christi pendentis in cruce'' ("A Dialogue Betwixt a Christian and Christ Hanging on the Crosse"). Howard also produced an English translation of [[John Justus of Landsberg]]'s ''Alloquia Jesu Christi ad animam fidelem'' ("An Epistle in the Person of Jesus Christ to the Faithful Soule") during his imprisonment in the Tower, which was posthumously published at [[Antwerp]], in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (1595). St. Philip Howard's translation of Marulić's poem was published instead of a [[preface]] to the Antwerp edition<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Pages 38–39.</ref> and again, with updated [[English orthography]], as part of the March/April 2022 issue of the [[literary magazine]], ''[[St. Austin Review]]''.<ref> By Marko Marulić, Translated by St. Phillip Howard, Edited by Brendan D.

On October 4, 1998, [[Pope John Paul II]] quoted from Marulić's ''Carmen de doctrina Domini nostri Iesu Christi pendentis in cruce'' ("Poem about the Teaching of Our Lord Jesus Christ Hanging on the Cross") during an apostolic visit to [[Solin]], Croatia, "One of your poets has written, ''Felix qui semper vitae bene computat usum'' ('Happy is he who always puts his life to good use.') It is vital to choose true values, not those which pass, to choose genuine truth, not half-truths and pseudo-truths. Do not trust those who promise you easy solutions. Nothing great can be built without sacrifice."<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Page 10, 27.</ref>

In 2024, Edward Mulholland, a [[Latinist]] and [[Classicist]] from the faculty of [[Benedictine College]] in [[Atchison, Kansas]], published the first complete English translation of the ''Davidiad'' in un-rhymed [[iambic pentameter]]. The work, which also includes an English translation of the ''Tropologica Expositio'', was released as an entry in LYSA Publishers's "LYNX" [[book series]] dedicated to neo-Latin texts.<ref>Marulić (2024), p. 8.</ref><ref>{{Cite book |date=2024 |title=The Davidiad |url=https://www.lysapublishers.com/book/the-davidiad/38 |access-date=August 9, 2024 |website=lysapublishers.com|doi=10.54179/2401 |last1=Marulić |first1=Marko |last2=Mulholland |first2=Edward |isbn=978-94-647531-3-4 }}</ref> 

In his introduction Mulholland explained, "The translation of a Vergilian epic owes much to translators of Vergil." Mulholland according expressed gratitude to the previous translators of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', especially [[Gavin Douglas]], [[John Dryden]], [[Robert Fagles]], and [[Robert Fitzgerald]]. Mulholland also explained that he had chosen to follow the existing convention that, "English [[epic poetry]] ... uses [[alliteration]] more often than Latin does." For this reason, Mulholland decided to publish his translation side by side with the Latin original, so that those able to read both languages could compare them to one another.<ref>Marulić (2024), pp. 39-42.</ref>

In 2023, Mulholland's translation of Book XIV had been named an honorable mention during the [[British Centre for Literary Translation]]'s John Dryden Translation Competition.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023 |title=Winners of the 2022-23 John Dryden Translation Competition |url=https://bcla.org/winners-of-the-2022-23-john-dryden-translation-competition/ |publisher=[[British Centre for Literary Translation]]}}</ref>

==Writing==
The central figure of the humanist circle in Split, Marulić was inspired by the [[Bible]], ancient writers and Christian hagiographies. The main topics of his writings were [[Christian theology|Christian theological]] by nature. He wrote many poems, discussions on theology and [[Christian ethics]], stories and epic poetry.<ref name="Marulianum" /> He wrote in three languages: [[Renaissance Latin]] (more than 80% of his surviving opus), [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] (three letters and two [[sonnet]]s are preserved). 

=== Croatian works ===
[[File:Spomenik Marku Maruliću u Kninu.JPG|thumb|Monument in [[Knin]].]]
[[File:Marko Marulic bust - lighting fix.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Marko Marulić by [[Ivan Meštrović]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]].]]
In his Croatian-language works, Marulić achieved a permanent status and position that has remained uncontested. His central Croatian oeuvre, the epic [[poem]] ''[[Judita]]'' (''{{lang|hr|Libar Marca Marula Splichianina V chomse sdarsi Istoria Sfete udouice Iudit u uersih haruacchi slosena chacho ona ubi uoiuodu Olopherna Posridu uoische gnegoue i oslodobi puch israelschi od ueliche pogibili}}'') written in 1501 and published in Venice in 1521, is based on the Biblical tale from a Deuterocanonical ''[[Book of Judith]]'', written in [[Čakavian dialect]], his mother tongue, and described by him as ''u versi haruacchi slozhena'' ("arranged in Croatian stanzas"). His other works in Croatian are:

* ''Suzana'' ("Susanna") – a Biblical poem in 780 verses, based on the account from the ''[[Book of Daniel]]'' of the [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Babylonian Jewish woman of the same name]] who was falsely accused of [[adultery]] and how her innocence was proven and she was saved from [[death by stoning]] by the timely intervention and interrogation of her accusers by the [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Prophet Daniel]].
* ''Poklad i korizma'' (Carnival and Lent), ''Spovid koludric od sedam smrtnih grihov'' ("A Nun's Confession of the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]"), ''Anka satir'' (Anka: A Satire) – secular poetry, and poetry dedicated to his sister ''Bira''
* ''Tužen'je grada Hjerosolima'' (Jerusalem's Lament) – anti-Turkish laments
* ''Molitva suprotiva Turkom'' ("A Prayer Against the Turks") – poem in 172 doubly rhymed [[dodecasyllable|dodecasyllablic]] stanzas of anti-Turkish theme, written between 1493 and 1500. The poem contains the hidden [[acrostic]] ''Solus deus potes nos liberare de tribulatione inimicorum nostrorum Turcorum sua potentia infinita,'' "Only God with his infinite might can save us from the misery of our enemies, the Turks", discovered by [[Luko Paljetak]]. It is believed to show the influence of [[Juraj Šižgorić]]'s  ''Elegija o pustošenju Šibenskog polja'' and the medieval song ''Spasi, Marije, tvojih vjernih'' from [[Tkonski miscellany]]. Marulić's poem in turn has influenced [[Petar Zoranić|Zoranić]]'s ''[[Planine]]'' – the first Croatian novel, in which ''ganka pastira Marula'' alludes to Turks, and also to [[Petar Lučić]] and his work ''Molitva Bogu protiv Turkom'', and [[Primož Trubar]]'s ''Pjesni zuper Turke''.<ref>[http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/ndd/08kolovoz/0818%20Marulic.html Marko Marulić] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215121617/http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/ndd/08kolovoz/0818%20Marulic.html |date=15 February 2009 }} ''at HRT archives.'' – Retrieved on 28 November 2008.</ref>

American historian [[John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr.]] emphasizes that Marulić belongs to a group of humanists and clerics placed in the "Croat" camp who, at least at the time they wrote their texts, did not seem to have a Croatian ethnic identity.<ref name="Jr.2006">{{cite book|last=Fine|first=John V. A. Jr.|title=When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans: A Study of Identity in Pre-Nationalist Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia in the medieval and early modern p1eriods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEF5oN5erE0C&pg=PA273|date=1 January 2006|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-02560-0|page=273|quote= Thus it seems that identity as "Croat", and particularly one with a feeling for such as an ethnic identity, was missing - at least at the time when those men wrote their texts - in all these figures. And they I might add included two figures placed in the "Croat" camp at the beginning of the chapter: Marko Marulić and Šimun Kožić}}</ref>
It must be noted however, that a critical review of Fine's work highlighted subjective conclusions. [[Neven Budak]] of the [[University of Zagreb]] noted "ideological prejudices", "omission of historical facts" and "preconceived conclusions" due to Fine's alleged personal bias regarding the former Yugoslavia and its various ethnic groups.<ref name="Budak-2009-hrcak-review-Ethnicity-Fine">{{cite journal |last1=Budak |first1=Neven |title=Kako se doista s jugonostalgičarskih pozicija može negirati hrvatska povijest ili o knjizi Johna V.

=== Latin works ===
 [[File:Marko Marulic Evangelistarium.jpg|thumb|170px| Cover sheet of Marulić's ''Evangelistarium'', 1571 [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]]-language edition, translated by Silvano Razzi from Latin original.]]
Marulić's European fame rested mainly on his works written in [[Renaissance Latin]] which were repeatedly re-published.

His ''[[Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae]]'', written between 1510 and 1517, contains the earliest known literary reference to the term [[psychology]].<ref name="Zubrinic">Darko Zubrinic, Zagreb (1995) [http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/lat.html#maru Croatian Humanists, Ecumenists, Latinists, and Encyclopaedists]. croatianhistory.net</ref><ref name="HJP">{{cite web|url=http://hjp.znanje.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&id=dl1nUBI|title=psihologija|work=Hrvatski jezični portal|language=hr|access-date=3 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=psych>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4SS0fcbm3xMC&pg=PA25|title=The Sciences of the Soul: The Early Modern Origins of Psychology|last=Vidal|first=Fernando|year=2011|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|page=25|isbn=9780226855882}}</ref>

In 1517, Marulić completed the ''[[Davidiad]]'' an epic poem which retold the [[Old Testament]] story of [[King David]] in Virgilian Latin with multiple references to [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. In addition to the small portions that attempt to recall [[Homer]], the ''Davidiad'' is heavily modeled upon [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''.<ref name=Marcovich_371>Marcovich (1973), p. 371.</ref> Indeed, the work was so heavily indebted to the Aeneid that Marulić's contemporaries called him the "Christian Virgil from Split."<ref>Gutsche (1975), p. 310.</ref> [[Serbian-American]] [[philologist]] [[Miroslav Marcovich]] also detects "the influence of [[Ovid]], [[Lucan]], and [[Statius]]" in the work.<ref name=Marcovich_vii>Marcovich (2006), p. vii.</ref>

The ''Davidiad'' was considered lost by 1567 and long remained so. After a search lasting nearly two centuries by Croatian [[literary scholar]]s at libraries and archives throughout Europe, Marulic's original manuscript (Ms. T) resurfaced at the [[Turin National University Library]] in 1922. News of its existence and the fact that it had never previously been published was spread throughout Classical academia by [[Carlo Dionisotti]] in 1952.<ref> Ante Kadic, ''St Francis Xavier and Marko Marulić'', "[[The Slavic and Eastern European Journal]]", Spring 1961, pp. 12–18.</ref> The ''[[editio princeps]]'' was published by [[Josip Badalić]] of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in [[1954 in poetry|1954]], but this work "proved to be a failure," as whole verses were left out and many words were misread by the editor.<ref name=Marcovich_374>Marcovich (1973), p. 374.</ref><ref name=Marcovich_viii-ix>Marcovich (2006), pp. viii{{en dash}}ix.</ref> Several years later, in [[1957 in poetry|1957]], Miroslav Marcovich overcame many of the difficulties that plagued Badalić's work and produced a more usable critical edition.<ref name=Marcovich_374/><ref name=Bruere198>Bruere (1959), p. 198.</ref> [[Latinist]] Veljko Gortan eventually corrected around 50 instances of misread words and published his own critical edition in 1974.<ref name=Marcovich_374/><ref name=Marcovich_ix>Marcovich (2006), p. ix.</ref> A [[literary translation]] of the ''Davidiad'' into Croatian [[hexameter]]s was made by [[Branimir Glavačić]] and published alongside the Latin original as part of [[Veljko Gortan]]'s edition in [[1974 in poetry|1974]].<ref> Marcovich (2006), page ''ix''.</ref> 

Marulić was active in the struggles against the [[Ottoman Turks]] who were invading the Croatian lands at that time. To this end, he wrote a Latin ''Epistola'' to [[Pope Adrian VI]] and begged for assistance in the fight against the Ottomans. In his epigram ''In discordiam principium Christianorum'' ("Against Discord between the Princes of the Christians"), Marulić denounced the monarchs of Europe for warring among themselves at a time when the Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[janissaries]] were invading [[Christendom]].<ref> Franz Posset (2021), ''Catholic Advocate of the Evangelical Truth: Marcus Marullus (Marko Marulić) of Split (1450–1524)'', [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]. Pages ''xii-xiii''.</ref>

=== Glasgow codex ===

A Marulić manuscript found in [[Glasgow University Library]] threw new light on his work and persona. It was discovered in 1995 by Darko Novaković, who stated that, in comparison with Marulić's known carmina minora, the poems in the codex introduce three thematic novelties. Unexpectedly vehement, satirical epigrams are featured and the intensity of his satirical impulse is startling, even in such conventional poems as epitaphs. Three poems reveal his love of animals. The greatest revelation are the verses which show Marulić as the author of love poems. This aspect represents the most serious challenge to the traditional picture of the poet: the last epigram in the collection is a true Priapeum marked with lascivious ambiguity.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/9568|title=Dva nepoznata Marulićeva rukopisa u Velikoj Britaniji: MS.
