He was also an internationally known [[beekeeper]].

==Biography==
Richard C. Taylor was born in Charlotte, Michigan on November 5, 1919 and earned his B.A. at the [[University of Illinois]] in 1941 and subsequently earned his M.A. from [[Oberlin College]] in 1947. In 1951, he received his PhD at [[Brown University]], where his supervisor was [[Roderick Chisholm]].<ref>[https://philpapers.org/rec/INWTAC-2 ''PhilPapers''. Inwagen, P. van. Ed. "Time and Cause: Essays Presented to Richard Taylor" Reidel (1980) Abstract. Biography of Richard Taylor on Philpapers.org]</ref>  During World War II he served his country as a commissioned submarine officer.<ref name=Obituary>[https://philosophynow.org/issues/44/Richard_Taylor_Remembered "Obituary: Richard Taylor Remembered"] by [[Robert L. Holmes]], Barry Gan, Tim Madigan, ''Philosophy Now'', Issue 44, 2004.</ref><ref>[https://philpapers.org/rec/INWTAC-2 ''PhilPapers''. Inwagen, P. van. Ed. "Time and Cause: Essays Presented to Richard Taylor" Reidel (1980) Abstract. Biography of Richard Taylor on Philpapers.org]</ref>

Over the course of his academic career, Taylor served as the William H. P. Faunce Professor of Philosophy at Brown University, a Professor of Philosophy (Graduate Faculty) at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] University and a Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Rochester]]. In addition, he assumed visiting appointments at about a dozen other institutions including: [[Cornell University]], [[Hamilton College]], [[Hartwick College|Hartwick]], Ohio State, [[Princeton University]], Union and [[Wells College]].<ref name=Obituary>[https://philosophynow.org/issues/44/Richard_Taylor_Remembered "Obituary: Richard Taylor Remembered"] by [[Robert L. Holmes]], Barry Gan, Tim Madigan, ''Philosophy Now'', Issue 44, 2004.</ref><ref>[https://philpapers.org/rec/INWTAC-2 ''PhilPapers''. Inwagen, P. van. Ed. "Time and Cause: Essays Presented to Richard Taylor" Reidel (1980) Abstract. Biography of Richard Taylor on Philpapers.org]</ref>

==Academic work==
In general terms Taylor argued that the ultimate objective of modern philosophical inquiry should not be the accumulation of a body of philosophical knowledge within a particular school of thought, which he characterized as being unattainable. Instead, he advocated a return to the ancient view that the study of philosophy is best described as the love of [[wisdom]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24435182 ''Metaphilosophy'' - "Faltering Wisdom: Richard Taylor and Philosophical Seeing" Netzky, Ralph. Vol. 5, No. 4 Wiley, pp. 320-332 on JSTOR.org]</ref> 

Defying conventional academic expectations, Taylor readily embraced the works of such ancient philosophers such as [[Thales]], [[Epicurus]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] while also admiring the more pessimistic contributions of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. He remained disdainful of the works of [[Immanuel Kant]], however, and was equally dismissive of the "foolishness" which sometimes characterized organized religious practice in general. Nevertheless, he was careful not to characterize himself as a [[secular humanist]].<ref name=Obituary/> 

It has been observed that in Taylor's view, the [[German idealists]] who followed Immanuel Kant were needlessly preoccupied with the formulation of an intricate system of intellectual moral philosophy which is based upon objective rules and a conceptualization of what it means to be dutiful. Following Schopenhauer's lead, Taylor objected to utilizing rationalism as the ultimate basis for any philosophical insight into the human condition. Like Schopenhauer, Taylor argued instead, that mankind's natural "will" or "striving" to achieve is far more fundamental than "rationality" per se. With this in mind, he argued against the emphasis placed by some modern philosophers on [[egalitarianism]] and pointed to the use of "compassion" as a source of moral value. In addition, he argued in favor of transcending a mundane existence through the pursuit of creative individual excellence and the realization of a [[virtuous]] life as envisioned by the philosophers of ancient Greece. As Taylor readily admitted, this qualified him as something akin to a philosophical "elitist".<ref>[https://www.pdcnet.org/philo/content/philo_1998_0001_0002_0061_0066 ''Philo'' -"The Philosophy of Richard Taylor" . Vol 1, No. 2 Fall-Winter 1998 pp. 61-66 "Restoring Pride: The Lost Virtue of Our Age" by Richard Taylor. Book reviewed by Paul B. Cliteur, Prof.of Philosophy at Technical University Delft on Scholarly Publications Leiden University on Philosophy Documentation Center Google.com]</ref>  

Paradoxically, Taylor was also quick to describe himself as a [[humanist]] who simultaneously embraced a belief in God as derived from his consciousness of the profound mysteries of life in the natural world. In this sense, he has also been described as an idiosyncratic [[Theist]] who does not necessarily support a particular organized religious practice per se, but who espouses a belief in a divine presence within the natural order.  Consequently, his views are analogous to those espused by [[Socrates]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[William James]] and to a lesser extent [[J. S. Mills]].<ref>[https://www.pdcnet.org/philo/content/philo_1998_0001_0002_0061_0066 ''Philo''-" Book reviews -The Philosophy of Richard Taylor" . Vol 1, No. 2 Fall-Winter 1998 pp. 61-66 "Restoring Pride: The Lost Virtue of Our Age" by Richard Taylor. Book reviewed by Paul B. Cliteur, Prof. of Philosophy at Technical University Delft on Philosophy Documentation Center Google.com]</ref> 

Always unpretentious, however, Taylor did not exempt his own philosophical output from harsh criticism and even humorously described some of it as being of "little account". Later in his academic career he reexamined his philosophical thoughts once again and subsequently embraced [[pacifism]] despite having served as a commissioned officer on a submarine during World War II. Above all else, he enjoyed [[dialectic]] exchanges with his students, as well as the practice of [[Socrates|Socratic]] whimsy in his lectures. His students at the University of Rochester often delighted in his custom of disavowing all pretense by conducting his lectures casually clad in khakis, a rugged pair of work boots and a flannel shirt while accompanied by Polly (his trusty Dalmatian), a warm thermos of hot tea and a kind hearted twinkle in his eye.<ref name=Obituary/>

Over the years, Taylor was a frequent contributor to the ''Free Inquiry'' magazine. He was also inducted into the [[International Academy of Humanism]]. In 1993, he debated [[William Lane Craig]] over the subject 'Is The Basis For Morality Natural or Supernatural?'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/is-the-basis-of-morality-natural-or-supernatural-the-craig-taylor-debate|title=Is the Basis of Morality Natural or Supernatural? - Reasonable Faith|website=www.reasonablefaith.org|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413220234/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/is-the-basis-of-morality-natural-or-supernatural-the-craig-taylor-debate|archive-date=2012-04-13}}</ref>

Taylor's best-known book was ''Metaphysics'' (1963). Other works included ''Action and Purpose'' (1966), ''Good and Evil'' (1970) and ''Virtue Ethics'' (1991). Taylor was also the editor of ''The Will to Live: Selected Writings of Arthur Schopenhauer''.<ref>Anchor Books A266: 1962.</ref><ref>[https://philpapers.org/s/Richard%20Taylor Richard Taylor's publications on Philpapers.org]</ref> He was an enthusiastic advocate of [[virtue ethics]].<ref>[https://philpapers.org/rec/TAYVEA ''Virtue Ethics: An Introduction''. Taylor Richard. Prometheus Books, 2002 Abstract on Philpapers.org]</ref> He also wrote influential papers on the [[meaning of life]], which, like [[Albert Camus]], he explored through an examination of the myth of [[Sisyphus]].

Taylor's 1962 essay "Fatalism"<ref>''Philosophical Review'', Vol. 71, No. 1 (1962).</ref> was the subject of [[David Foster Wallace]]'s undergraduate thesis at [[Amherst College]], published in 2011 together with Taylor's essay and contemporary responses under the title ''Fate, Time, and Language: An Essay on Free Will''.<ref>New York: Columbia University Press ({{ISBN|978-0-231-15156-6}})</ref>

Notable philosophers who studied under Taylor as graduate students include [[Norman Bowie]], [[Myles Brand]], [[Keith Lehrer]], and [[Peter van Inwagen]].<ref name=Holmes>{{cite web |last1=Holmes |first1=Robert |title=Richard Taylor Remembered |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/44/Richard_Taylor_Remembered |publisher=Philosophy Now |access-date=29 March 2019 |date=2004}}</ref>

==Apiarist==
In addition to his achievements within the academic realm, Taylor was a devoted [[apiarist]] and also made significant contributions to the art of [[beekeeping]]. He owned three hundred hives of bees and, from 1970, produced mostly [[comb honey]]. He explained his management techniques in several books, including ''The Comb Honey Book'' and ''The Joys of Beekeeping''.<ref>[https://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n79151529/ ''the Joys of Beekeeping'' by Richard Taylor on Worldcat.org]</ref> In keeping with his philosophical convictions, his honey stand was located in front of his country home on [[Cayuga Lake]]  and was operated strictly on the honor system, which Taylor encouraged through the use of gentle and kind solicitations posted on its walls.<ref name=Obituary/>

==Death==
Taylor died at the age of 83 on October 30, 2003, in his home in [[Trumansburg]], [[New York (state)|New York]] due to complications ensuing from [[lung cancer]].<ref name=Holmes/>
